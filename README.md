# Text_Summarization

The aim of this study is to assess and compare the effectiveness of various text summarisation models. This study seeks to identify the most suitable model capable of generating accurate summaries. These summaries aim to provide accurate synopses enabling researcher and medical professionals to grasp the contents of healthcare articles with clinical relevance before further study. 

Furthermore, in the future, the selected model can be utilised for an automated text summarisation (ATS) process. This process allows researchers and medical professionals to quickly access multiple articles through concise and informative summaries.
