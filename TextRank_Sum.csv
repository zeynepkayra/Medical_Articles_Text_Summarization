"the birth of a premature infant has long been documented as a stressful event for parents . the premature birth of an infant and the following neonatal intensive care cause psychological distress and can have a traumatizing effect on parents . the neonatal intensive care unit ( nicu ) environment has the potential to exacerbate stress for parents of infants admitted to the nicu . 
 mothers have typically been found to have higher levels of distress than fathers and they experience significant levels of stress and depression in the early postpartum period . maternal stress can have deleterious effects on mother - infant interaction , particularly on mothers abilities to form an attachment to their baby . 
 maternal stress diminishes the mother 's ability to be sensitive to the infant 's cues and be responsive in interacting with the infant . participating in infant care influences the maternal feelings in a positive direction . 
 finding of a study has shown that a mother who is denied the opportunity comparing to a mother whose child is left feeling confused and anxious . when the mother is nearby , breastfeeds and takes care of her child 's daily care she has a feeling of participation . 
 this situation creates a need for practices that support parents during the acute phase of their infant 's hospitalization in neonatal intensive care . 
 the facilitation of maternal confidence and positive parenting in the nicu may be a key point in establishing and sustaining long - term healthy mother - infant interactions and positive child outcomes . 
 nicus have been established in iran since about 1984 , and today they are running in the state and private hospitals of 31 provinces under the supervision of a neonatologist . 
 there are high - tech equipments for infants treatment in most of these wards and mothers can settle in specific rooms close to the ward , so that they can go to their infants to take care of them primarily based on their willing and abilities at the times . 
 fathers can also visit their infants in specific hours , but they can not stay there and no health care is provided for them . the premature birth rate in the place of research , esfahan , isfahan , is about 12 - 13% , and due to the prepared facilities , especially in the state hospitals , many of these infants would be saved . in iran , no organized goal - oriented effort has been taken to increase the parents information and confidence and to decrease the mothers stress and anxiety following giving birth to an immature infant and its being in nicu . 
 this would cause distress in mother - infant interaction , and so , the absence of timely and effective mothers participation in taking care of the infant . on the other hand , 
 the nursing workload in nicus is too high and nurses do not have enough time to help parents . 
 regarding without to these points , researchers tend to conduct the creating opportunities for parent empowerment ( cope ) program in this survey . as a result 
 , researchers tend to conduct the creating opportunities for parent empowerment ( cope ) program in this survey . 
 due to the fact that it is both a written and audiotaped program and the information is provided in a simple language , it is not a time - consuming work for the nurses to transfer the information to the parents .

 the goal is to teach parents the normal behaviors and characteristics of a preemie , and various activities help the parents to understand and appreciate their baby 's special qualities . 
 the content of the cope program and skill - building activities is guided by self - regulation theory ( johnson , fieler , jones , wlasowicz , and mitchell , 1997 ) and control theory ( carver , 1979 ) ( as cited in melnyk et al . , 2001 ) . 
 on the basis of these theories , cope intervention would strengthen parents knowledge and beliefs about their premature infants and their own parenting role and remove barriers that would inhibit them from participating in their infants care and interacting with them in a developmentally sensitive manner . 
 phase i occurs 2 - 4 days after infants hospitalization , phase ii occurs 2 - 4 days after phase i , phase iii occurs 1 - 3 days before discharge to home , and the last one occurs 1 week after discharge from the nicu . in every phase , mothers get a pictorial booklet and related audiotaped information . 
 moreover , in order to implement the experimental information , parent is given a four - phase workbook and is supposed to do and record the related activities .

 ii , in addition to giving emphasis on the information in the first one , it renders new information about infant 's behaviors , its growth and development , and gives further suggestions regarding increasing the mother 's participation to take care of the infant and meeting its needs .

 data were collected from september 2009 to february 2010 in the educational nicus of state hospitals affiliated to isfahan university of medical sciences in iran ( 20-bed nicu in shaheed beheshti hospital and 14-bed nicu in alzahra hospital ) . following the father 's inability to stay long and take care of the infant in ward 's environment , 
 all mothers who were 18 years and older , could read and speak persian , had no infant admitted to the nicu , and with infants with the following criteria participated in this study : ( a ) gestational age of 26 - 34 weeks , ( b ) birth weight of less than 2500 g and appropriate for gestational age , ( c ) anticipated survival , ( d ) singleton birth , ( e ) no severe handicapping conditions , and ( f ) born at the study sites . 
 mothers were excluded from the study if they did not visit their infants for more than 4 days and if their infants died or discharged before completing the cope program . 
 researchers screened 290 premature births and 135 of them met the eligibility criteria [ figure 1 ] . among these 135 eligible births , 
 20 ( 14.8% ) mothers refused participation , with the majority of them wanting to concentrate only on the new infant or they believed that participation would take time away from the other children at home . 
 researchers were unable to contact the mothers of 15 ( 11.1% ) premature infants who met the eligibility criteria . 
 mothers who agreed to participate were randomly assigned to the study conditions by using rand function in excel 2007 . the final sample after randomization comprised 100 mothers . 
 after enrollment and randomization of the study groups , data for 10 mothers were eliminated from the study for analyses . 
 five mothers in the cope program were eliminated from the study because of infant death ( n = 2 ) , transfer to another hospital ( n = 1 ) or completion of baseline measures only ( n = 2 ) . 
 five comparison mothers also were eliminated from the analysis because of infant death ( n = 2 ) or completion of baseline measures only ( n = 3 ) . 
 therefore , the final sample for data analyses included 90 mothers ( 45 in the cope and 45 in the comparison group ) . 
 the well - known state - trait anxiety inventory ( stai ) was used to measure maternal state and trait anxiety . 
 current feelings of anxiety are measured with the a - state scale , while an individual 's anxiety  proneness  is measured in the 20-item trait scale ( a - trait ) . 
 a - state was used as the dependent variable to assess mothers current anxiety levels . 
 trait anxiety was assessed at one contact point only to measure anxiety proneness . maternal trait anxiety and demographic measures 
 are considered as important covariates in the study because findings from prior research have supported that these variables have potential effects on maternal state anxiety and mother - infant interaction . 
 the reliability was measured by cronbach 's alpha , and it was 0.93 for state anxiety and 0.87 for trait anxiety . 
 content validity index was measured as validity , and it was 0.97 for state anxiety and 0.99 for trait anxiety . 
 the parental stressor scale : neonatal intensive care ( pss : nicu ) assessed parental stress in the nicu arising from four dimensions : ( a ) sights and sounds , ( b ) infant behavior and appearance , ( c ) parental role alteration , and ( d ) staff behaviors and communication . 
 parents rate their perceptions of the stress level generated by each of the 46 items on a 5-point likert scale ranging from 1 ( = non - stressful ) to 5 ( = extremely stressful ) . 
 the index of parental participation / hospitalized infant ( ipp - hi ) is an instrument that is designed for nurses and/or mothers to rate the range of care - related activities that mothers were observed or reported themselves to be involved in while there infant is hospitalized in an nicu . 
 the ipp / hi is described as a 25-item dichotomous instrument that measures a range of previous 48-h time period activities of mothers , including items that pertain to routine infant care , basic illness - related care , emotional and developmental care , information seeking , and involvement in care by serving as an advocate and a decision - maker . 
 cronbach 's alpha was 0.90 and content validity index was 0.99 . concerning the point that it takes more time to implement phase iii of the cope program and that phase iv is conducted on the basis of home visit which is not common in iran , these phases were omitted with the program designer 's permission . 
 the issues of every phase consist of the scientific information in simple language , which almost coincided with nicus conditions in iran . 
 the necessary reformation regarding the context 's eloquence and fluency was done with the help of three faculty members of the school of nursing and midwifery , shaheed beheshti medical university . 
 then , the information was prepared in the form of audiotape and a booklet ( a separate booklet for every phase with related picture ) . 
 finally , in order to measure the booklet and audiotape fluency and clearness in mothers opinion , a pilot study was done on five mothers . in each hospital 
 , there was a suitable room ( without noise and shuttling ) beside the nicu , which were useless in the evening . 
 mothers came to this place alone and one of the researchers gave instruments to them to complete . 
 two to four days post nicu admission , the mother completed demographic and infant variables questionnaire as well as state anxiety inventory and the parental stressor scale . 
 then , the phase i booklet was given to the mother and she listened to its audiotape . 
 manipulation checks consisted of 10 true or false questions that the mother answered immediately after each intervention phase to assure they processed the audiotaped information . 
 the first set of activity workbook was then given to the mother with specific instructions on how to complete . 
 four to eight days post nicu admission , the mother completed stai and the parental stressor scale . 
 next , the phase 2 booklet was given to the mother and she listened to its audiotape . 
 then , the mother answered the phase 2 manipulation check questions , and at the end , she received phase ii of activity workbook with specific instructions on how to complete . 
 six to twelve days post nicu admission was the last visit of the research for each mother and she completed state anxiety inventory , the parental stressor scale , and the ( ipp - hi ) . 
 researcher requested the mother to complete the workbook activities and she monitored them throughout the study . 
 researcher prompted the mothers who had not completed the activities by the time of the next phase of the intervention to perform them by the next contact . 
 mothers in the comparison group filled out all questionnaires at the same time as the intervention group ( 2 - 4 , 4 - 8 , and 6 - 12 days after infant hospitalization ) . 
 they did not receive the cope program , but using the content of each phase of the cope program , one of the researchers answered all their questions . 
 after ultimate assessment ( 6 - 12 days after infant hospitalization ) , this group also received a booklet which is a combination of phases i and ii of the cope program .

 after ultimate assessment ( 6 - 12 days after infant hospitalization ) , this group also received a booklet which is a combination of phases i and ii of the cope program . 
 data were analyzed using spss 16 for windows . a p value of 0.05 was set for statistical significance . 
 in addition , t - tests for continuous variables ,  analyses for categorical variables , and mann - whitney u test for qualitative variables were performed to determine if the two study groups differed in these baseline factors . 
 spearman correlation test and repeated measurements test were also performed . among the 90 mothers , 
 no significant group differences were found at baseline in maternal demographic and infant variables [ tables 1 and 2 ] . 
 in addition , no baseline differences between groups were found for stress and anxiety [ table 3 ] . 
 comparability of the cope intervention and comparison groups conditions comparability of the cope intervention and comparison groups infant conditions during the nicu hospitalization , mothers in the cope program reported significantly less overall parental stress in the nicu than did mothers in the comparison group [ figure 2 ] . 
 mothers state anxiety decreased over time , with significant cope and comparison - group differences identified [ figure 3 ] . 
 mothers in the cope program were also more involved in their infants care in the nicu than the comparison mothers [ figure 4 ] . 
 maternal stress over time maternal state anxiety over time maternal participation cope mothers had also significantly high total scores on the questions in manipulation checks dealing with the cope - program content , indicating that mothers processed the content of the program from all two phases of the interventions . 
 the purpose of this study was to perform the cope program for iranian mothers and evaluate its effectiveness on the level of stress , anxiety , and participation of mothers who have premature infants hospitalized in nicus . 
 findings of this study provide additional support for earlier studies that proved instructing parents in premature behavior and involving them in the care of their infant may facilitate bonding , increase parents confidence in care giving , and possibly improve the parent - child relationship . 
 after performing just the first stage of the program , the state anxiety level of the mothers reduced , and after performing phase ii of the program , the state anxiety level of the mothers further reduced . since most mothers education was less than diploma , it can be said that the information in phases i and ii could the level of education in most of the mothers was less than diploma ( high school ) , it can be said that the information in phases i and ii could provide iranian mothers information needs . 
 clear information of the infant 's condition provided for parents on a regular basis facilitates accurate perception of the infant 's morbidity , with subsequent alterations in distress levels . after performing two phases of cope program , 
 mothers stress reduced in the experimental group , while assessments conducted at the same time in the control group indicated that stress in the second assessment was more than in the first one . 
 this finding indicates that parents of premature infants experience heightened anxiety and stress during and following their infants nicu stay . 
 cope mothers were significantly less stressed related to nicu because they were given concrete information regarding the nicu environment and what to expect of their premature infants . 
 the results of this study showed that the mothers participation in the experimental group was more than that in the control group . through the parental role information in the cope program 
 , mothers learned how best to interact with their infants during hospitalization and were encouraged to be involved in their infants care . 
 nursing support reduces parental stress and anxiety during infants nicu hospitalization and , therefore , fosters the parents abilities to cope with the difficulties they are facing . giving understandable information is critical for optimal parental involvement in their infant 's care . in the study of melnyk et al . 
 ( 2006 ) , all four phases of the cope program were conducted in the usa . 
 the results of this study demonstrate the following : mothers in the cope program reported significantly less overall parental stress in the nicu than did mothers in the comparison group , the level of mothers anxiety reduced at the end of program ( after performing phase iv ) , and the mother 's participation in taking care of the infant did not have significant statistical differences between the two groups . contrasting this study with the study of melnyk et al . 
 ( 2006 ) , the findings of the two studies are the same in the effect of program on the mothers stress related to nicu . however , the results of anxiety and participation are different . also , there are differences in the socioeconomic status of samples in the two studies . 
 most of the mothers education was less than a diploma in the present study , while most of the mothers had an education level of more than a diploma in the study of melnyk et al . 
 ( 2006 ) . also , the income of most of the families in this study was less than $ 4000 , but the families in melnyk et al . 
 's ( 2006 ) study had more than $ 40,000 as income . according to the above analysis , further and earlier effect of program in this study can be due to economical and cultural differences between samples . on the other hand , welfare and educational facilities and psychological support are not the same in these two countries . 
 this is the supportive finding for this claim that higher ses socioeconomic status mothers have stricter and more demanding cognitive schemas for their own beliefs / confidence in how they should parent their premature infants , while lower socioeconomic status mothers may have schemas that are less rigid . 
 one of the limitations of this study is that it was conducted in only the state hospitals . 
 potential differences in practice may exist in private institutions that may influence generalizability of the findings . 
 it also would be possible to determine if the intervention program may have positive effect on fathers psychological condition in the situation that they could not participate in their infants care during hospitalization in the nicu . 
 analyzing the results of the present study specified that psychological status and participation of iranian mothers who had premature infants improved by presenting cope intervention in the nicus . during this program , mothers knew about the differences between their infants and mature infants , and they learned how to play their maternal role in the nicu and how to interact suitably with their infants . 
 therefore , the results of this study confirm the findings of previous studies regarding theory - based intervention with parents of premature infants that begins early in the nicu stay and results in ( 1 ) less parental stress in the nicu , ( 2 ) more positive parent - infant interactions in the nicu , and ( 3 ) less parental anxiety after hospitalization .","phase contains tendered information immature infant physical behavioral features differences mature immature infants information nicu environment offers strategies help parents participate taking care infant

 / hospitalized infant were used . 
 intervention group received two phases of cope program . 
 this program consisted of information and behavioral activities about the characteristics of premature infants . 
 sessions interval was from 2 to 4 days . 
 stress and anxiety were measured three times ( before each phase and 2 - 4 days after the second phase ) . 
 mothers participation was evaluated 2 - 4 days after the second phase . 
 the t - test , 2 , mann - whitney u test , and repeated measurement test were used for data analysis.results:mothers in the intervention group reported significantly less anxiety and less stress in the nicu after performing each phase of the cope program ( p < 0.001 ) , whereas at this time , the level of stress in the comparison group increased . 
 also , cope mothers participated in their infants care rather than the mothers in the comparison group ( p < 0.001).conclusion : cope program was effective for iranian mothers . 
 this study shows that irrespective of any culture , giving early and comprehensible educational - behavioral information may have positive effect on maternal psychological condition and maternal  infant interaction ."
"de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert address concerns relating to the definition of a ced and the distinction between treatment and enhancement . 
 they raise a number of problems with the treatment - enhancement distinction and suggest that we need to ask  whether we are prepared to change the definition of health used by the medical devices directive. there are in fact three questions raised here . 
 the first is whether our proposal requires a robust characterization of the treatment - enhancement distinction , the second is whether our suggestions , as we intended them , actually involve changing the definition of heath implicit in the mdd ( there is no explicit definition ) , and the third is whether the mere inclusion of ceds within the mdd will have the de facto effect of changing the implicit regulatory concept of  health or 
 treatment. in response to the first question , we would maintain that it is in fact an advantage of our approach that it minimizes the importance given to the treatment - enhancement distinction and thus diminishes the need to characterize it in a way that is immune to criticism . 
 on our approach , devices intended for enhancement are regulated in a similar manner to therapeutic medical devices . 
 thus , if some enhancement devices are misclassified as therapeutic devices , or vice versa , this will not have major implications for their regulation . 
 what matters , from our perspective , are risks and benefits . by contrast , some alternative approaches , including the one recommended by de ridder and collaborators , would regulate ceds and therapeutic medical devices quite differently , with the result that misclassification would have more significant regulatory effects , since devices regulated under the general product safety directive alone are held to less specific and less stringent standards . in short , 
 we agree that the treatment - enhancement distinction is problematic  and some of us have elsewhere rejected it  but we believe a desire to mitigate the problems it raises counts in favor of our approach , not against it 
 . we would also dispute the suggestion that our approach requires any modification to the concept of health . 
 our proposal was not to  change the definition of health ( nor  treatment ) but , rather , to bring some non - therapeutic devices , which do not aim to improve health problems , within the remit of the mdd . 
 our proposals involved leaving the definition of a medical device used by the mdd unaltered . 
 ceds would not be medical devices on the mdd definition . instead , an ancillary positive list is proposed to bring specific devices with a non - medical purpose within the remit of the mdd alongside those devices defined as medical devices according to the criteria employed in the directive . by proposing an ancillary list for specific cognition - affecting devices without a medical purpose , 
 we in fact reinforce the concepts ( ie medical and non - medical ) underpinning the european commission 's proposed creation of annex xv for implantable and other invasive devices for which the manufacturer claims only a non - medical purpose . 
 we proposed that this list should be extended to include non - invasive neuromodulation for non - medical purposes . 
 however , the third implicit question indeed requires consideration : will there be a de facto change in what is meant by  health and 
 treatment if ceds are regulated under the mdd ? arguably , the mere association of ceds with therapeutic medical devices could result in an expansion of the concepts of treatment and health . 
 the possible implications of a shift in what is seen as  health - related or 
 there , they suggest that medical device regulation might underscore the  illusion that devices are beneficial . 
 however , we suggest that the idea that tdcs and tms techniques can yield cognitive enhancement in healthy adults is not a mere illusion . 
 further , we suggested that regulatory approval of moderately risky brain stimulation devices should be dependent on evidence of at least some degree of 
 performance. in this respect , it would be important to notify consumers explicitly on which population the ced has shown to be beneficial while reminding that it can be ineffective or detrimental to other populations . 
 regulation would therefore go some way towards ensuring that effects are not illusory for those devices that are approved ( although individuals could believe effects to be bigger than they are ) . 
 whilst we concede de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert 's point that there is currently  no substantive evidence that ceds produce lasting effects outside of research and clinical settings ( p. 320 ) , there is a wealth of scientific research that provides proof of concept for the cognitive enhancing effects of tdcs and tms techniques . that the ceds on the market have not been subject to objective assessment is part of the reason why regulation is needed and counts in its favor . 
 they argue that contemporary scholarship shows no serious harms associated with the use of neurofeedback or tdcs . in response to this 
 , we wish to point out  particularly in relation to active devices used for tdcs and tms  that , whilst devices have indeed been use safely in the laboratory , and the regulated devices that researchers use in such contexts are indeed conducive to safe use , these facts do nothing to ensure that the unregulated devices on sale for enhancement exhibit the same safety profile . 
 first , the exclusion criteria for brain stimulation research are much more conservative than marketed exclusion criteria . 
 second , while brain stimulation experiments lasts usually between a single session to a dozen ( the latter is a relatively rare scenario ) , there is not safety data on the usage of brain stimulation over a long period of time such as months or years . 
 essentially , regulation is needed to ensure that devices sold for enhancement are as similar as possible to those devices about which kuersten and hamilton make their safety claims . indeed  and to illustrate the point from another perspective 
 fitz and reiner raised concerns about the foc.us device in their commentary : 
 the internal electrodes exceed the general safety guidelines for current density at all stimulation levels , the voltage limits do not behave as specified in the manual , the device behaves unpredictably when its connection to the head is lost , and under some circumstances the foc.us can generate small voltage current spikes . 
 the internal electrodes exceed the general safety guidelines for current density at all stimulation levels , the voltage limits do not behave as specified in the manual , the device behaves unpredictably when its connection to the head is lost , and under some circumstances the foc.us can generate small voltage current spikes . 
 accordingly , we emphasize : just because tdcs can be safe does not mean that all of the particular devices on sale are meeting the same level of safety . further , at the end of their commentary , and perhaps in tension with their assertion that the sorts of ceds we discuss present no significant risks , kuersten and hamilton say that low - risk devices should not be excluded from on - going oversight , since  so much concerning the brain , what affects it , and how remains unknown ( p. 347 ) . 
 we wish here to emphasize that low - risk devices , as we envisioned them , would typically be non - active devices such as neurofeedback equipment , which they correctly claim pose no risks qua devices ( see below ) . given their comments on the safety of neurofeeback , especially considered simply as a device , we would be surprised if they would think that such equipment required on - going oversight . 
 thus , even if there is room to disagree about whether ced is the right label for non - active devices ( as we discuss below ) , we in fact seem to agree on the lack of need for the continual regulation of low - risk devices , such as those that do not transfer energy through the skull . kuersten and hamilton object to our inclusion of neurofeedback as a ced . 
 however , in offering our definition of ceds , we were not aiming to provide the definitive view on what does and what does not fall within this category . 
 our interest in offering a definition was only to facilitate identification of a class of non - therapeutic devices that should receive regulatory attention and , on that definition , neurofeedback plausibly does qualify as a ced . 
 note also that doubts about whether neurofeedback equipment qualifies as a ced on a precise understanding of that term could also be raised regarding tdcs equipment , which kuersten and hamilton believe does qualify . 
 they argue that  what actually affects the brain is therapy used with [ neurofeeback equipment] ( p. 341 ) . 
 but tdcs also only enhances cognitive performance when combined with cognitive training exercises , so could be excluded from the category of ceds on similar grounds . 
 nevertheless , kuersten and hamilton are right to highlight that tdcs directly modulates brain activity whereas neurofeedback modulates it through psychological mechanisms . 
 we have no problem with the suggestion that this is a significant difference , and indeed it informs our suggestion that tdcs and tms should be classed as iia or iib devices , due to their active nature , and neurofeedback should be in class i , if regulated at all . 
 kuersten and hamilton next argue that including ceds under the definition of a medical device would not result in our suggested problem of overbroadness ( which we suggested would occur if the definition of a medical device were to be altered ) , since devices , they claim , would be limited by the definition to those that 
 investigate , replace or modify the anatomy or a physiological process. their claim is based on the assumption that ceds could fall under the definition as it is currently articulated . 
 however , it was the possibility that an altered definition would be overbroad that we thought counted in favor of a supplementary positive list . in setting out our proposals , we worked on the assumption that the current definition did not in fact capture ceds ( due to the principal criterion that a medical device be intended to treat , prevent or diagnose ) and that changing the definition to remove this principal criterion across the board would have the result that it would then be overbroad . if the principal criterion were simply that a medical device investigate , replace or modify the anatomy or a physiological process then all sorts of devices would fall under the remit of the mdd  from earrings to nail extensions . 
 indeed , the european commission used precisely this argument to support the creation of a positive list of implantable or other invasive devices without a medical purpose . 
 according to their impact assessment on the revision of the regulatory framework for medical devices , the definition of a medical device stipulates that it be intended for treatment , prevention or diagnosis , and the removal of this criterion would result in overbroadness , making a positive list the preferred solution in the case of certain cosmetic devices . 
 our argument for an analogous list for ceds is based on the assumption that the european commission is correct in its understanding of the mdd and the implications of the current and possible definitions employed therein . 
 fitz and reiner broadly support our proposals and endorse our central claim , viz . that the regulatory framework for medical devices should be extended to include ceds . 
 nevertheless , they raise a concern about the ability of ced users to evaluate the risks of ceds , saying that  evidence that consumers are in a strong position to evaluate the risks associated with ced use is lacking ( p. 323 ) . whilst we agree that consumers will not be perfect rational calculators 
 , we emphasize that our proposals would eliminate devices from the market that were manifestly dangerous or far more dangerous than needed to serve their intended function . 
 in addition , our liberal view is committed to the contention that allowing some room for error in consumers weighing of benefits vs. risks in relation to their individual well - being can be a justifiable cost of allowing individuals greater autonomy and freedom of action . 
 we stress also that what the risks of devices are  their nature and likelihood  is something that would , in line with the procedure for medical devices , be assessed by a group of experts prior to approval for the market . 
 so , although we agree that leaving some room for consumer valuation of risk leaves open the possibility that individuals will not factor this carefully into their decision whether to use a product , we contend that this is an acceptable cost of a liberal approach to regulation . 
 further , we would like to emphasize that the current lack of regulation implicitly signals to home users that there are no real concerns with ceds , as otherwise they would have been regulated 
 ie the perception is likely to be that , given the lack of regulation , there are no risks for consumers to evaluate at all . 
 thus , even if consumers are not perfect risk calculators , the current situation it likely to be more misleading than one in which risks have been identified by regulators . 
 king , gavaghan , and mcmillan provide an interesting critique of our proposals relating to consumer assessment of ceds , and in particular their risks and benefits . 
 they agree that the concept of medical benefit is not always appropriate for ceds ( especially where designed and sold only for enhancement ) and that well - being would be the theoretically appropriate construct when assessing such ceds . 
 however , they suggest that well - being , harm and risk are difficult to assess in the pre - market approval process and raise a particular concern about the phenomenon of  risk compensation. the central feature of this phenomenon is that some individuals have a propensity for taking a certain level of risk and will increase the riskiness of what they are doing until this propensity is met . 
 they therefore challenge the assumption that pre - market approval will make the use of ceds safer overall , especially in the context of experimental home use . 
 they suggest that , where users are determined to use devices in a risky way , they will do so despite safety standards . in response to this 
 , we raise a point of empirical uncertainty , and emphasize what can still be achieved through regulation , despite the phenomenon of risk compensation instantiated in some individuals . 
 it might be true that people will tend to fulfill their propensity for a particular total amount of risk in their lives , but it is unclear whether they do this by assuming superfluous risk to achieve a particular goal or seeking further risky goals . perhaps , as king and colleagues suggest , achieving one goal more safely allows one to assume additional risk in relation to other pursuits . 
 however , a risk quota might also be met by increasing or maintaining the level of risk one exposes oneself to in pursuit of one 's current primary goal . which is the case is likely to depend on the number of goals one believes to be valuable to pursue . 
 if ceds are made safer , would users with high risk thresholds seek to obtain riskier devices , or would their risk quota be freed up to pursue additional risky activities ? 
 the question is essentially whether individuals tend to increase riskiness across all activities until their risk propensity is met , or whether they increase the riskiness of every activity to some threshold level for each activity , regardless of how superfluous this risk may be . 
 if the former , risk reducing regulation could still have benefits in the form of facilitating pursuit of other risky , but perhaps all - things - considered valuable , activities . 
 even if individuals with a high risk threshold are inclined to practice riskier use as the device itself becomes safer , we assume that king and colleagues would agree that it is still better that the devices available pose as low a risk as possible to achieve their effects , and that unjustifiably dangerous devices are prohibited from placement on the market . 
 eg by using failsafe mechanisms , audible warnings , and limits on stimulation duration and strength . 
 an individual 's propensity to take risks with a product does not render consideration of that product 's safety redundant . 
 by analogy , just because some individuals routinely drive dangerously , this does not negate the need to try to make cars as safe as possible . 
 even if those engaging in risk compensation reap no overall benefit from making ceds safer , failing to minimize risks would unfairly jeopardize those who do not so compensate . 
 johnson , gillett , and snelling suggest that the most convincing argument in favor of our position is based on the regulatory assessment of risk , which they believe should be the sole consideration in pre - market assessment . 
 we suggest here that our respective proposals are not as different as they may have seemed , as we proposed that risk should be the primary regulatory concern . however , we diverge from the position advocated by them in our contention that objective improvements to cognitive capacities are amenable and relevant to assessment . 
 baseline ( or , we infer ,  upper limit ) level of risk that society feels an individual should be able to take ( eg skydiving or climbing ) , and then require manufacturers to quantify risks only . 
 they argue for this position by pointing out that when technologies are new , and particularly when new technologies are used for an innovative application , variation in the effects on individuals and useful endpoints my not be obvious ab initio . 
 our first response is to note that the same applies for risks  novel applications may present novel and variable risks that are as difficult to predict as the cognitive improvements one might obtain from such applications . 
 our second response is to emphasize that the model we proposed is actually quite close to a risk - only model ; at least , it is a risk - first model . 
 we suggested using risk as the primary way of categorizing a device and that benefits should only be considered in terms of objective improvements  eg demonstrated improvements in a cognitive capacity , such working memory  which are precisely the sorts of effects about which manufacturers make their claims . 
 importantly , this consideration of objective benefit is not intended to downplay the broader benefits that an individual might attain from using a device . 
 whilst objective benefits can be considered , they must not be thought to constitute the only determinants of well - being . 
 nonetheless , regulators should still ensure that consumers are provided with information on objective benefits . 
 indeed , the distinction between  thick and  thin considerations of well - being drawn by king , gavaghan , and mcmillan is illuminating in this regard . 
 thin well - being , they say , consists only in  all - purpose goods , whereas a thick well - being incorporates the individual agent 's conception of value and his particular circumstances . 
 an objective impairment in , say , verbal working memory ( that occurs as a trade - off of an objective improvement in , say , visuospatial working memory ) , will present the very same challenges for quantification , despite such impairment constituting a risk rather than a benefit . to the extent , as the risk only model assumes , that objective risks can be quantified ( and impairment in verbal working memory indeed permits such quantification ) objective benefits along the same sorts of dimensions can also be quantified ) . 
 further , we suggested that room should be made to account for the difficulty of measuring effects ( positive or negative ) on thick well - being . 
 our proposal was that , once the manufacturer had made it clear what the objective benefits and risks are for moderately risky devices , the consumer should have the freedom to decide whether that benefit  risk ratio is acceptable for them ( for example , because they expect it to result in a net gain in thick well - being ) . 
 on the other hand , we proposed that high - risk devices , presenting risks that might be classed  all - purpose bads ( eg a high risk of seizure ) , should be prohibited for sale on the consumer market . 
 whatever the individual 's life plans , in the preponderance of cases of healthy adult use , a seizure is unlikely to promote these plans . where there is scope for disagreement about the value of an effect  for example as to whether a small impairment in verbal working memory is a reasonable price to pay for a similarly sized improvement in visuospatial working memory 
 level of acceptable risk therefore plays a greater role than quantification of benefits in our overall framework . as an objection to our model , king , gavaghan , and mcmillan 
 present the example of the surgical insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to treat normal pressure hydrocephalus . 
 they note that this would be a high - risk procedure on our proposals , as it comes with the risk of seizures , stroke , paralysis , and death . 
 moreover , there has never been a comprehensive multicenter randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the performance of this product . 
 this is thus a high - risk procedure for which there is no good evidence of benefit . 
 nevertheless , they seem to suggest , the use of this procedure should be permitted . 
 it might seem , then , that consistency requires permitting the use of some high - risk ceds as well , calling into doubt our claim that high - risk ceds should not be allowed on the market . in response 
 , we would note that patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus typically have much more to lose from non - intervention than do healthy individuals considering whether to employ ceds . 
 indeed , one might think that advancing dementia is amongst the worst fates that might befall a person . 
 there is thus a case for tolerating much greater risk in devices intended to treat this condition than in ceds . 
 king and collaborators also use the ventriculoperitoneal shunt example to suggest that it may not be practical to enforce the provision of evidence - based measures of efficacy to consumers for ceds . in response to this 
 , we emphasize that we do not have in mind a requirement such that each manufacturer must perform a randomized controlled trial using their device . 
 research investigating tdcs and tms in healthy adults is demonstrating efficacy , and we envisage that manufacturers should be required to show how their device complies with design parameters equivalent to those that have been shown in the scientific literature to produce enhancement effects . for example , devices with electrodes positioned in locations on the scalp that have no evidence of producing the particular effect claimed by the manufacturer should not be approved for sale alongside such claims . 
 manufacturers must be able to identify a credible body of scientific literature that supports the claimed efficacy and safety , given the product 's characteristics  electrode location , stimulation intensity , duration , and so on . 
 further , we agree with king , gavaghan , and mcmillan that manufacturers should be required to state clearly the lack of evidence for any unsubstantiated claims , if they are to be allowed to make them at all . 
 kuersten and hamilton also comment on the risk  benefit assessment of ceds , and the standard to which we proposed they should be subjected . 
 they argue that there is a lot of room for maneuver in the mdd to assess  acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits ( p. 346 ) . 
 this is true , but we nonetheless think a framework for assessment is helpful , especially when the devices in question purport to offer  non - medical benefits , a concept for which medical device regulators have little precedent . indeed , we argued against adopting the approach originally suggested by the mhra for cosmetic devices , which is very risk - averse : according to their approach such devices must present  no or the minimum acceptable risk , as they confer no  clinical benefit. conceding that some framework could be helpful , kuersten and hamilton suggest that , because the concept of benefit is  nebulous , in the case of ceds , only risk should matter for pre - market approval . 
 in fact , as discussed above , we are broadly in agreement with such a position 
 benefits become increasingly harder to quantify and assess as they move beyond the sorts of benefits that enable individuals to pursue the standard range of activities most people wish to pursue . for example , not being in great pain would count as a benefit for most people , regardless of what they valued , but a small improvement to mathematical ability , for example , would not permit such evaluative consensus . 
 as noted above , our inclusion of regulatory consideration of benefits for moderately risky devices was intended only to refer to objective improvements  about which consumers should not be misled . for example , if manufacturers claim that their device improves , say , the user 's linguistic fluency , this is a claim that can be tested and measured objectively . 
 beneficial such an objective improvement is to any particular person will vary depending on their goals , but there will be a fact of the matter about whether the device is able to confer such an improvement aside from the subjective question of how valuable this improvement might be . 
 certainly , we would advocate regulating the claims that manufacturers make in relation to what their devices can achieve . 
 however , far from our proposals being  overly paternalistic , we argued that where there was room for disagreement about how to quantify a benefit in relation to risks , regulation should err on the side of consumer freedom . 
 further to their concerns regarding individuals abilities to weigh risks , fitz and reiner emphasize the remaining problem of  do - it - yourself ( diy ) users who , in constructing devices from scratch , will be afforded no protection by the regulation of direct - to - consumer devices . 
 one of their proposals , with which we agree , is to bolster our recommendations with additional attempts at  active harm reduction. they suggest that members of the professional community could join together to create an  inclusive online community , where information could be gathered and disseminated with professional oversight . 
 we are broadly sympathetic with much of what they propose and would support the creation of an inclusive online community , were there to be sufficient expert interest in creating and maintaining it . 
 indeed , we are currently exploring how expert advice could be dispensed via existing fora , such as reddit . 
 de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert also raise the problem of unsupervised use and suggest potential solutions in the form of age limits , safety - by - design , and requiring user licenses . we agree that the unsupervised use of ceds needs consideration , but do not agree that this should lead to their apparent conclusion that we should regulate the use of ceds rather than their placement on the market . 
 the first task must be to ensure that the devices that people use ( unsupervised or otherwise ) are not unnecessarily dangerous or simply defective by design . 
 this can be achieved for example through european medical device law , which focuses on premarket requirements and reporting on post - market experience , even though it does not regulate use ( apart from requirements related to the instructions the manufacturers must provide ) . 
 there is no point carefully regulating use if the devices being used are not safe to begin with . 
 further , the authors suggestion that ceds should be made safe by design requires enforcement beyond that granted by the general product safety directive , and this is precisely the sort of thing that could be achieved by a model of the sort we propose . 
 de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert raise the concern that the societal benefits of enhancement might be lost if devices are in fact effective but regulated . in relation to this 
 , we emphasize that the regulation we advocate is not akin to prohibition . to the extent that our proposals would prevent devices from being placed on the market 
 , this would be limited to very dangerous devices or devices making implausible claims  hardly the sorts of devices that would confer net societal benefits . 
 the important point that many other commentators on our model appear to overlook is that the effectiveness of brain stimulation techniques as a type of intervention does not guarantee the effectiveness of particular token devices claiming to be of this effective type . 
 moreover , as low risk , effective devices are developed , these would be available under our proposal and a vigorous market will emerge . 
 de ridder , vanneste , and focquaert raise concerns about the misuse of resources , which assumes a position markedly different from that which we set out in our paper . 
 they argue , persuasively , that resources should be directed to the most important causes and that enhancements might not be of a high enough priority to warrant use of our limited resources . 
 we agree that limited resources need to be allocated carefully , but our proposal does not threaten such allocation : the devices that would be prohibited under our proposal are ones that would certainly not warrant significant investment of public resources , and our proposal leaves open how resources should be allocated among those that would be permitted . 
 perhaps de ridder and collaborators assumed us to be advocating the inclusion of ceds under the healthcare funding arrangements , but this is not what we envisaged . 
 the extension to the scope of the mdd , as we recommend it , has no direct implications for the distribution of healthcare resources . 
 relatedly , the authors ask whether the regulation of ceds requires new regulations regarding who can use them . again 
 , the answer is for the most part no : our proposals merely affect what can be placed on the market for consumers to purchase . 
 the only exception should be restrictions governing the use of ceds on children or vulnerable adults through contraindication labeling and the criminal law . 
 in contrast , adult consumers will not need a prescription to purchase and use ceds on themselves . indeed , king , gavaghan , and mcmillan provide a compelling argument in their commentary for why medical practitioners should not serve as gatekeepers to cognitive enhancement . also of relevance to the question of the correct place of enhancement in healthcare , king , 
 gavaghan , and mcmillan suggest that our reference to formally trained practitioners was not developed . 
 we used this phrase in relation to the use of ceds in children and vulnerable adults , since our proposals envisaged that healthy adults would be able to directly purchase and use ceds , with no medical intermediary . 
 they ask whether we envisage a further tier of regulation and raise a number of interesting points that would need to be addressed if medical professionals or those offering alternative therapies were to serve as gatekeepers to the use of ceds in such populations . 
 they are correct that the regulation of such practice would indeed introduce a  further tier of regulation , and we acknowledge that this issue was not addressed in our original paper . 
 however , we believe that the scope for the permissible use of ceds on children may be limited . 
 further , neuromodulation offered to vulnerable adults overseen by medical professionals will primarily be governed by existing medical ethical guidelines , since such use is likely to be therapeutic and hence occurs within the clinical domain . in relation to children , 
 king , gavaghan , and mcmillan are correct that further thought is needed to establish how use in adolescents should be controlled , and with whose oversight . 
 however , ensuring the safety of devices that might be used for enhancement in children and placing controls on such use are separate issues and both are important . whilst our proposals were concerned with controlling which devices are sold directly to consumers , we agree that the regulation of services , especially those offered to children needs close attention . 
 kuersten and hamilton object that we fail to cite much law on the remit of the mdd . 
 the suggestion seems to be that this has left us underinformed . attempting to clarify the current regulatory situation 
 , they say that instead of the definition of a medical device being the significant factor in the non - application of the mdd to ceds , ceds are instead unlikely to fall under the mdd because  manufacturers targeting the general market are discouraged from intending them  for a medical purpose ( which they argue manufacturers have  considerable latitude to do ) ( p. 344 ) . 
 manufacturers are deterred , they say , because intending that a device be used for a medical purpose mandates costlier and more time - consuming requirements . we suggest that this is precisely the problem : manufacturers should not be able to evade regulation just because they deem it to be too burdensome . 
 we are fully aware that it is the manufacturers intentions identifiable from the claims they make in relation to their products  that are instrumental in bringing a device within the definition of a medical device . 
 we argue that , particularly in the case of brain stimulation devices , opting not to fall under the definition of a medical device should not be a possibility . 
 however , kuersten and hamilton suggest that manufacturers intentions will in fact not matter once a new definition comes in to force , which will  specifically define a medical purpose. they cite the mhra 's overview of the current proposals for the current revision of medical devices legislation , proposals with which we are very familiar . 
 they quote the document as follows , saying that the definition of medical purpose will  remove this decision from manufacturers : 
  [ m]edical device means any instrument , apparatus , appliance , software , implant , reagent or other article , intended by the manufacturer to be used alone or in combination , for human beings for one or more of the specific medical purposes of :  investigation , replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process or state ( pp . 
 [ m]edical device means any instrument , apparatus , appliance , software , implant , reagent or other article , intended by the manufacturer to be used alone or in combination , for human beings for one or more of the specific medical purposes of :  investigation , replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process or state ( pp . 
 , we suggest that it can not be seen how the manufacturer 's intentions become irrelevant ; on the contrary , they are referred to explicitly . 
 further , rather than the indents defining medical purpose , the scope of medical purpose is constrained to the specific instances given in the indents . indeed , the consultation documents from the european commission and the uk 's medical and healthcare products agency underscore the continued relevance of the medical / non - medical purpose distinction in relation to devices that replace or modify anatomy : their proposal of a positive list ( in annex xv ) of implantable or other invasive devices without a medical purpose would be redundant if any replacement or modification of anatomy were to constitute a medical purpose . 
 again , the indents in the definition of a medical device serve to constrain , rather than define , medical purpose . thus , we rely not only on the court of justice decision , but also on the interpretation of the mdd offered by the mhra and other european commission documents . 
 kuersten and hamilton perhaps think that there should not be a gap , or may think that the definitions should be interpreted differently . 
 but the fact is , given the way the definitions are currently being understood by the relevant parties , it will take more than the cited revised definition of a medical device to bring ceds within the scope of the mdd . 
 we were gratified that our paper prompted so much discussion . in reading the commentaries and articulating our responses 
 , it became apparent that the comments and critiques served foremost to highlight the modest scope of our original proposals . whilst we still believe that pre - market approval is highly important for ceds especially for those that transfer energy across the skull 
 the further proposals made in these commentaries serve to set an agenda for continued discussion of the optimum integrated policy response to ceds and , indeed , other new and emerging technologies designed for enhancement .","raise number problems treatment enhancement distinction suggest need ask whether prepared change definition health used medical devices directive

 further , since the publication of our recommendations , the number of manufacturers of brain stimulation devices for non - medical purposes has increased , underscoring the need for a regulatory response . in this paper , we clarify aspects of our original proposal and address additional regulatory issues beyond our original focus on the sale of devices . 
 we begin with theoretical points pertaining to the definition of a ced and the distinction between treatment and enhancement . 
 we then respond to practical challenges raised by the prospect of implementing our regulatory framework .

"it is not easy to define a  good  health care system and  good  health care services . in these definitions 
 , there is a complexity of elements or components , which contribute separately , but influence in a harmonized manner the perceptions towards a given health care system ( 1 , 2 ) . 
 the health care system in albania has undergone several periods in which the health care concept has evolved significantly ( 3,4 ) . 
 currently , the health care system in albania consists of three main pillars : primary , secondary and tertiary health care services ( 3 ) . the quality of health care is the consequence of strong links between service providers and users of the health care services at all levels ( 5 ) . 
 perceived quality is one of the principal determinants of utilization and non - utilization of health care services ( 6 , 7 ) , a major issue in developing and transitional countries including albania , a former communist country in the western balkans which has undergone tremendous political and socioeconomic changes in the past two decades associated with significant health consequences ( 8 , 9 ) . 
 in addition , the rapid process of transition in albania over the past two decades has been associated with an intensive process of internal migration ( from rural areas to urban areas of the country , especially in tirana , the albanian capital city ) and external migration ( mainly to the neighboring countries including greece and italy ) ( 9 ) . 
 migration is linked to an increased aging which , in turn , enhances the general and already existing aging effect on healthcare utilization ( that is the relative care needs of the albanian population ) . to date 
 , however , the available information regarding the quality of primary health care services in albania is scarce . in this framework , 
 the aim of our study was to assess the quality of the primary health care services in albania with a main focus on family physicians perceptions towards the quality of health care services provided to the general population . 
 a cross - sectional study was conducted in january - march 2013 including a representative sample of 132 physicians providing primary health care services in several polyclinics ( health centers ) of tirana . 
 initially , a simple random sample of 150 physicians operating at primary health care level in tirana was targeted for recruitment . of these , 
 18 physicians could not be contacted ( n=7 ) , or refused to participate ( n=11 ) . 
 the final study population consisted of 132 physicians ( 59 men aged 41.36.9 years and 73 women aged 43.74.8 years ; overall response rate : 132/150=88% ) . 
 a structured self - administered and anonymous questionnaire was applied to all male and female primary health care physicians who agreed to participate in this survey . 
 the questionnaire consisted of self - assessment of the following key dimensions / components of primary health care services : physical conditions at the workplace ( measurement scale : good [ score : 2 ] , average [ score : 1 ] , bad [ score : 0 ] ) ; availability and quality of working devices and equipment for proper diagnostic and treatment services ( measurement scale : not available [ score : 0 ] , available but not good [ score ; 1 ] , available and good [ score : 2 ] ) ; sources of scientific information available at the workplace ( not available [ score : 0 ] , available but outdated [ score : 1 ] , available and updated [ score ; 2 ] ) ; level of autonomy in decision - making ( no autonomy [ score : 0 ] , partial autonomy [ score : 1 ] , sufficient autonomy [ score : 2 ] ) . a summary score ( ranging from 0 to 8) 
 was calculated for each physician based on these four dimensions of the quality of health care services which was dichotomized into inadequate quality ( overall score : 0 - 4 ) vs. adequate quality of health care services ( summary score : 5 - 8 ) . 
 in addition , demographic data ( age and sex of physicians ) , information on working experience , number of population served , working place ( polyclinic , or health center ) , type of specialization received and involvement in teaching / training activities were collected for all physicians included in the study . 
 median values ( and their respective interquartile ranges ) were used to describe the distribution of age , duration of work experience and the number of population served by the physicians included in this cross - sectional study . 
 conversely , frequency distributions ( absolute numbers and their respective percentages ) were used to describe the distribution of sex , working place , specialization , involvement in teaching and training activities of the primary health care physicians . similarly , 
 absolute numbers and their respective percentages were used to describe the distribution of the key dimensions / components of primary health care services according to physicians perceptions ( physical conditions at the workplace , devices and equipment , sources of information and level of autonomy ) . 
 binary logistic regression was used to assess the association between the self - assessed overall quality of primary health care services ( adequate vs. inadequate ) with baseline characteristics of primary health care physicians . odds ratios ( ors ) , 95% confidence intervals ( 95%ci ) and their respective p - values were calculated . 
 spss ( statistical package for social sciences , version 15.0 ) , was used for all the statistical analyses . 
 demographic characteristics , working experience , specialization received , teaching involvement and population coverage of primary health care physicians included in this survey are presented in table 1 . 
 median age of study participants was 44 years ( interquartile range : 38 - 51 years ) . 
 median working experience was 14 years ( interquartile range : 4.5 - 23.5 years ) . 
 median number of population served was 2500 inhabitants ( interquartile range : 2000 - 4000 ) . 
 about 37% of the physicians were specialized in family medicine , 42% were general practitioners , whereas 21% had received other types of specializations including cardiology , pediatrics , rheumatology , or allergology . 
 only 29.5% of primary health care physicians included in this study were involved in teaching and training activities ( table 1 ) .

 * median values and interquartile ranges ( in parentheses ) .  numbers and column percentages ( in parentheses ) . 
 table 2 presents the distribution of selected key dimensions / components of primary health care services according to physicians perceptions . 
 overall , 31% of the physicians considered  good  the physical conditions at their workplace , whereas 24% deemed them 
 about 24% of the physicians perceived that there were no devices and equipment for a proper diagnosis and treatment of their patients , as opposed to 40% of the physicians who considered the equipment and devices available and appropriate . 
 about 48% of the physicians stated that there were no sources of scientific information available at their workplace , compared with 20% of physicians who reported availability of updated sources of scientific information at their workplace . 
 about 67% of the physicians perceived a complete lack of autonomy in decision - making , whereas 10% of physicians perceived sufficient autonomy in decision - making in their current ( routine ) health care practice ( table 2 ) . 
 distribution of selected key dimensions of primary health care services according to physicians perceptions table 3 presents the association of the self - assessed quality of services with characteristics of primary health care physicians included in this survey . 
 age of physicians was positively related to the self - perceived level of quality of health care services . 
 hence , younger physicians reported a lower quality of health care services compared with their older counterparts , a finding which was borderline statistically significant ( or=0.79 , 95%ci=0.61 - 1.04 ) . 
 the odds of perception of adequate health care services were lower in men compared to women , a finding which was statistically significant ( or=0.68 , 95%ci=0.42 - 0.91 ) . 
 physicians with less than ten years of working experience had significantly lower odds of perceiving the services as  adequate  ( or=0.77 , 95%ci=0.51 - 0.94 ) . 
 the number of population served was a borderline  predictor  of the quality of primary health care services ( p=0.09 ) . 
 physicians specialized in family medicine had significantly higher odds of perception of services as  adequate  compared with the rest of physicians who were not trained in family medicine ( or=1.56 , 95%ci=1.13 - 1.97 ) . on the other hand , 
 involvement in teaching or training activities was not significantly related to the self - perceived quality of primary health care services ( table 3 ) .

 main findings of this survey relate to a positive association of an adequate quality of primary health care services with female gender , older age , working experience and training in family medicine of physicians operating at primary health care level in tirana , the albanian capital . these are generally in line with previous reports from the international literature ( 5 - 7 ) . 
 albanian doctors working at the primary health care sector face many difficulties in their professional practice . 
 hence , albanian physicians are currently expected to provide not only high - quality services , but they should also apply competencies related to leadership , management , and community support at large . from this point of view , our findings suggest that older doctors and those with more years of working experience tend to report a higher quality of primary health care services  reflecting a more favorable attitude which may be presumably linked to a higher level of professional skills and competencies . 
 the population coverage was only a borderline predictor of the self - reported quality of services in the sample of primary health care physicians included in this study . 
 this is an intuitive finding , in line with the expected direction , as the level of physicians competencies is related to the experience gained in the course of their health care practice ( 6 ) . 
 our study was based on doctors perceptions about their working conditions and working environment and this can imply a subjective evaluation that can bear the possibility of information biases in the assessment of the current situation in terms of the quality of primary health care services in albania . therefore , health authorities in albania should develop and implement suitable instruments to measure the quality of health care services at all levels . 
 furthermore , there is also a need to place in the public domain tool kits that can be used by physicians , administrators , and patient groups to assess and improve the quality of care . 
 similar to many countries , albania should develop a national quality report , based on standardized comprehensive and scientifically valid measures , which should describe the country s progress in improving quality of care ( 10,11 ) . 
 measurement and ranking of the quality of health care services should also involve patients perspective , in line with experiences and practices from other countries ( 10,11 ) . 
 the current survey was an attempt to provide evidence about the perceptions of primary health care physicians regarding different aspects of their profession . 
 our findings indicate that albanian doctors face several difficulties in performing their everyday tasks and , therefore , health authorities must undertake measures to improve their performance through provision of better working environment , availability and improvement of the instruments and diagnostic devices for diagnostic and treatment services .

"the prosite database uses two kinds of signatures or descriptors to identify conserved regions , i.e. patterns and generalized profiles , which both have their own strengths and weaknesses defining their area of optimum application . 
 each prosite signature is linked to an annotation document where the user can find information on the protein family or domain detected by the signature : origin of its name , taxonomic occurrence , domain architecture , function , 3d structure , main characteristics of the sequence , domain size and some references . as a more detailed description of the prosite database 
 has already been provided in previous publications ( 1,2 ) , this paper will only focus on recent developments that have taken place during the last 2 years . 
 patterns or regular expressions are useful tools to identify short and well - conserved regions , such as catalytic sites , binding sites , post - transcriptional modifications ( ptms ) or zinc fingers . 
 they are also easy to construct and to use by biologists that have no knowledge in bioinformatics . 
 if a new sequence has an amino acid at a conserved position that was not present in the seed alignment used to construct the pattern , it will not be recognized . 
 thus , patterns need to be updated regularly to introduce this new variability in the regular expression . 
 this tool uses the prosite match list , which stores true positives , false positives ( fp ) , false negatives ( fn ) , partial and unknown matches , to generate a new pattern that minimizes fp and fn . 
 we first take care of fn in a three - step procedure : 
 the patterns that can potentially be updated are selected . updating a pattern to recover fn amounts to introduce more variability in the pattern , but it increases the risk of creating new fp . hence 
 the selection procedure consists of running all prosite patterns on a random database to keep only the ones that do not produce too many matches.mismatches produced by each fn are detected and the pattern is modified accordingly to accept the observed residues.the new pattern is tested on a random database to see whether it is still stringent enough . if it produces too many matches in a random database , the pattern is refined and some mismatch positions are removed . 
 updating a pattern to recover fn amounts to introduce more variability in the pattern , but it increases the risk of creating new fp . 
 the selection procedure consists of running all prosite patterns on a random database to keep only the ones that do not produce too many matches . 
 mismatches produced by each fn are detected and the pattern is modified accordingly to accept the observed residues . 
 the new pattern is tested on a random database to see whether it is still stringent enough . 
 if it produces too many matches in a random database , the pattern is refined and some mismatch positions are removed . to remove false positives we check 
 we look at these positions for amino acids that are only found in fp sequences . 
 forbidden ( { } with the prosite syntax ) at these positions in the new pattern . 
 the new pattern is then used to scan swiss - prot and all new matches are checked manually . only patterns that produce no new false positives are kept . 
 this strategy has allowed the automatic update of 943 patterns ( out of a total of 1322 patterns in prosite ) . 
 2661 fn ( out of a total of 14  412 ) and 1927 fp ( out of a total of 7446 ) were removed . 
 we have also removed the less specific patterns that could not be updated and have replaced them by profiles . 
 the application of these two strategies allowed a decrease of the number of fp and fn in the swiss - prot part of uniprot by 25% . 
 when a signature identifies a conserved region in a given protein , it is important to know what functional information can be transferred to this new protein according to what is known about the function of the conserved region . 
 if the information that is transferred is very general ( name and position of a given domain in a sequence ) only the occurrence of a match with a descriptor at a reliable score is enough . but descriptors can supply much more precise information . if one looks at the residue level , functional sites such as active sites , disulfide bridges or ptm sites can be identified . 
 one can also look at the domain arrangement to discriminate between particular families or sub - families . 
 prosite has a long experience in documentation and detailed annotation of domains , families and functional sites . 
 this information is mainly stored in free text and used by biologists who read the various documents and make their own decision on the function of their protein according to the prosite matches . but with the rapid growth of sequence databases , there is an increasing need for a reliable tool that can generate automatically precise and accurate functional annotation in standard format . 
 we thus decided to group some functional information stored in prosite in a database of rules that can easily be read by a program and applied on proteins that are recognized by prosite profiles . 
 prorule generates annotation in swiss - prot format for de , cc , kw or ft lines . 
 two types of information are stored in prorule : 
 general information : the occurrence of a match with a profile is enough to trigger this annotation . 
 usually , it is restricted to the name of the domain and the position of its boundaries.conditional information : this is dependent on the presence of given amino acids at precise positions , on the occurrence of other domains or on taxonomic specificity . 
 for example , an enzymatic active site is annotated only if the correct amino acid is found at the required position .

 conditional information : this is dependent on the presence of given amino acids at precise positions , on the occurrence of other domains or on taxonomic specificity . 
 for example , an enzymatic active site is annotated only if the correct amino acid is found at the required position . 
 prorule is extensively used by swiss - prot curators to facilitate the annotation work and to check the consistency of swiss - prot entries . 
 but it can also be accessible for external users through the scanprosite web page ( see below ) or downloaded from the prosite ftp site under prosite license conditions . for more details on prorule and its range of application 
 the prosite website was redesigned and new predictive tools were implemented to assign more detailed functional information to the scanned proteins . 
 users who want to scan their own proteins against all prosite entries or to scan a prosite entry against a protein database will find a new version of the scanprosite web page . 
 prosite matches on uniprot knowledgebase ( uniprotkb ) or pdb entries are now pre - calculated and stored in a relational database ( postgresql ) that is maintained in collaboration with swiss - prot ( 4 ) . 
 each prorule associated with a prosite profile is also scanned , which allows the localization of interesting functional residues such as active sites , ptms and disulfide bridges . 
 these features are only shown if the expected amino acid is found at the right position . 
 but we also indicate missing features when we expect another amino acid at a given position . 
 this tool can be used to identify divergent subfamilies of proteins like inactive enzymes . in figure 1a 
 , we show the scanprosite output for the human ephrin b4 receptor , which is a functional kinase receptor ( 5 ) , and its paralogue the ephrin b6 receptor , which is known to have an inactive kinase domain ( 6 ) . 
 the scanprosite output indicates that the expected asp residue was not found at the position of the active site in ephrin b6 receptor . to test the efficiency of the method 
 we used scanprosite to identify all mammalian homologues of the ephrin b6 receptor and to construct a multiple sequence alignment ( msa ) of this subfamily ( figure 1b ) . 
 the msa also shows that the conserved asp residue of the active site is found in none of the ephrin b6 receptor orthologues . 
 scanprosite can also be used to identify new uncharacterized subfamilies of putatively inactive enzymes ( figure 1c ) . from the scanprosite web page , 
 we have searched with the kinase profile ( ps50011 ) for plant proteins that have no detected active site and a common domain arrangement . 
 we have identified an uncharacterized family of putatively inactive kinases , which is conserved in various plant genomes as it is shown in the msa . the documentation page has also been reorganized . 
 it now contains three main sections : 
 the description part that exposes the main characteristics of the domain or the family and a representative list of proteins that contain the domain or belong to the family.a technical section that refers to the descriptors used to identify the domain or family . 
 for each descriptor , there is a link to a domain architecture view of uniprotkb proteins matched by the descriptor , an msa in different formats , a link to retrieve the list of proteins matched by the descriptor in various formats and a link to a taxonomy tree view of all entries containing the domain . 
 there is also an external link to msdsite ( 7 ) to view ligand binding statistics of the domain and a link to 3d structures.the third section is the reference block where , for each reference , we added the pubmed i d and a direct link to the article .

 the architecture view of prosite profiles is now visible , from each uniprotkb entry on the expasy server , from the prosite documentation page and from the scanprosite web page . in each view 
 , some interesting residues are tagged according to prorule predictions ( see figure 1a ) . 
 all these tools were designed to recover very divergent proteins ( < 20% of similarity ) . 
 they were developed 10 years ago when protein databases were quite small and very few representative genomes were sequenced . 
 there was thus a strong sample bias when constructing seed alignments and profile tools that used these seeds needed to be strongly predictive . 
 currently , proteins databases are 10 times bigger and thousands of genomes have been sequenced spanning the whole tree of life . 
 it is now easier to have a seed alignment with representatives of all possible variability and descriptors can be more conservative . 
 there is rather an increasing need for more specific descriptors in order to have more precise functional information . 
 as we described previously , specific annotation can be assigned to a match with a profile when looking in the matched region at the residue level for the presence of particular amino acids at particular sites , such as enzymatic active sites , disulphide bridges , etc . 
 we thus have developed a new strategy to annotate the msa at these particular sites and to transfer this information to the profile builder program . 
 we have used this strategy to adjust specific parameters in a column - dependant manner . 
 the tool aim is to be more stringent on specific columns and to produce a better local alignment , which then helps to re - localize the functional residues in sequences matched by the profile .

 weekly updates of prosite are available on our ftp server : .prosite is also accessible from the hits page : .frame - tolerant scans can be performed at the following address : . 
 the left protein is a classical ephrin receptor protein ( ephrin b4 receptor protein ) which is known to transduce a signal through its kinase domain ( 5 ) . 
 the right protein is also an ephrin receptor protein ( human ephrin b6 receptor protein ) but with an inactive kinase domain ( 6 ) . 
 the prorule associated with the kinase domain identifies an active site in ephrin b4 receptor but not in ephrin b6 receptor ( absent feature : active site ) . 
 ( b ) we used scanprosite to identify orthologues of the ephrin b6 receptor in mammals , searching for proteins that have the same domain arrangement and have a putative inactive kinase domain .

"although about two - thirds of patients with epilepsy ( pwe ) treated with antiepileptic drugs ( aeds ) reach seizure - freedom , about one - third remains drug - resistant to the current therapies.1 despite the introduction of new aeds with a better pharmacokinetic and safety profile compared to old generation aeds , today , one of the major causes of failure of antiepileptic treatment is poor adherence often due to occurrence of adverse drug reactions ( adrs ) , leading up to 25% of patients to discontinue treatment before the achievement of effective doses and with a consequent increase of health care costs.2,3 during the last 25 years , many efforts have been directed to the development of new aeds with different mechanisms of action able to reduce brain hyperexcitability ; recently considerable interest has been focused on synaptic vesicle protein 2a ( sv2a ) and its role as a target for aeds.4 the first drug of this new class approved for epilepsy is levetiracetam ( lev ) , and from this lead compound , several racetam analogs have been synthesized.5 based on target - drug program , brivaracetam ( brv ) ( 2s)-2-[(4r)-2-oxo-4-propylpyrro - lidinyl]butanamide , an n - propyl analog of lev has been identified and has entered clinical trials for pwe;6 it is an sv2a ligand with high selectivity and a 1030-fold higher potency , depending on the experimental conditions , when compared to lev.7,8 the purpose of this review is to present updated data available on the pharmacology , efficacy , and tolerability of brv . 
 we have conducted a systematic search in the pubmed and cochrane library databases up to august 14 , 2015 summarizing all relevant data for efficacy , safety , and tolerability of brv in the treatment of partial - onset seizure . 
 although the correlation between sv2a binding and anti - convulsant potency in animal models has been previously demonstrated , the role of sv2a in neurotransmission still remains unclear.9 in fact , even if it has been established that sv2a protein is involved in normal synaptic vesicle function , the exact mechanism of synaptic vesicle cycling regulation and neurotransmitter release remains unknown.5,9 several preclinical studies have demonstrated that brv is more potent and efficacious than lev in animal models of both focal and generalized epilepsy.10 in particular , in fully amygdala - kindled rats , brv induced a significant suppression in motor - seizure severity from a dose of 21.2 mg / kg , whereas lev caused a similar effect from a dose of 170 mg / kg . 
 brv also significantly reduced the after - discharge duration at the highest dose tested ( 212.3 mg / kg ) , whereas lev was inactive on this parameter up to 1,700 mg / kg.10 moreover , brv protected significantly against both partial and generalized seizures in fully amygdala - kindled mice resistant to phenytoin ( effective dose 50 [ ed50 ] : 68.3 mg / kg , intraperitoneal [ ip]).10 recently , it has been demonstrated that brv has a higher brain permeability than lev , with consequently more rapid onset of action after acute dosing in audiogenic mice ; this fast onset of action might also have a potential clinical relevance for the treatment of status epilepticus or cluster seizures.11 another study confirmed the protective activity of brv against kindled seizures with focal seizure threshold and significantly severity significantly modified.12 furthermore , a recent study , using a rapid kindling model in p14 , p21 , p28 , and p60 rats , has evaluated two doses of brv 10 and 100 mg / kg , demonstrating that brv 100 mg / kg significantly increased the after - discharge threshold at all ages , whereas brv 10 mg / kg increased after - discharge threshold in p60 , p28 , and p21 rats . 
 brv also reduced the after - discharge duration , achieving statistical significance with 10 and 100 mg / kg at p60 and with 100 mg / kg , at p21 . 
 at p60 , brv increases the number of stimulations required to reach stage 45 seizures in a dose - dependent manner . at p28 and p21 , brv increased the number of stimulations required to develop stage 45 seizures in a dose - dependent manner , with almost complete elimination of stage 45 seizures.13 moreover , brv showed a marked synergism with diazepam to reduce seizure duration in self - sustained status epilepticus induced by stimulation of the perforant path.14 a recent study has evaluated the antiseizure and antimyoclonic activities of brv in comparison to lev in an animal model of posthypoxic myoclonus , showing higher efficacy of brv ( 0.3 mg / kg ) than lev ( 3 mg / kg ) against posthypoxic seizures.15 furthermore , recent experiments conducted in transgenic mice with alzheimer s disease supported an adjunctive and peculiar role of brv that not only revealed an efficacy against spike - wave discharges similar to ethosuximide , but it showed the ability to reverse memory impairment , thus extending the potential spectrum of action of this new aed.16 in addition to sv2a block , brv also exhibits inhibitory activity on neuronal voltage - gated sodium channels ( vgsc ) playing a role as a partial antagonist , as has been reported for other aeds.17,18 in particular , experimental studies on primary cortical cultures have demonstrated that brv is able to prolong the sodium channel time recovery from fast inactivation , and this effect could reduce the availability of sodium channel during high - frequency repetitive firing.17,19 even if this data has been refuted by another recent experimental study that has showed that this vgsc inhibition does not impair sustained repetitive firing in neurons of neuroblastoma cells,20 this is an important aspect , which deserves to be better clarified , since the lack of effect of brv to reduce neuronal excitability by blocking high repetitive firing in neurons might exclude that the modulation of vgsc contributes to antiseizure effects of brv . 
 brv presents a favorable pharmacokinetic profile , linear and predictable , with low intersubject variability and almost 100% bioavailability.2123 the pharmacokinetic properties of brv have been studied in healthy adult volunteers , in the elderly , in patients with pwe , and in those with hepatic or renal impairment.2225 the pharmacokinetic differences in elderly subjects compared to healthy volunteers are not so important as to require any dose adjustment.25 absorption of brv is unaffected by the presence of food , including high fat meals ; after oral administration , brv is rapidly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract , and displays linear and dose - proportional profile over the dose range tested.22,26 its distribution volume is close to total body water ( vz=0.5 l / kg ) , and it binds weakly to plasma proteins ( 17.5% ) . 
 its terminal half - life is ~9 hours.21 saliva and plasma brv levels are highly correlated , brv crosses the mucosa by passive diffusion , therefore , the saliva concentration of brv is correlated with plasma concentration . 
 it is possible to speculate that saliva might be a suitable sample for monitoring brv levels when blood sampling could be a limiting factor.23 brv is extensively metabolized through several metabolic pathways and is fully excreted by urine ( only 8%11% remains unchanged ) . 
 brv is eliminated primarily by metabolism , with the major metabolic pathway involving hydrolysis of the acetamide group resulting in formation of an acid metabolite ( brv - ac ; 34.2% of a radiolabeled dose in urine).21 a secondary pathway , mainly mediated by cytochrome p450 ( cyp ) 2c19,27 forms a hydroxy metabolite ( brv - oh ; 15.9% of dose in urine).21 a combination of these two pathways leads to the formation of a hydroxyacid metabolite ( 15.2% of dose in urine);21,28 only 8.6% of the dose is recovered as the unchanged compound in urine.21 all three metabolites of brv are pharmacologically inactive ( unpublished results ) in an open - label study conducted in patients with liver disease , the plasma half - life of brv was prolonged up to 17.4 hours in correlation with the severity of hepatic impairment ; however , the exposure to brv is increased by 50%60% in patients with hepatic impairment , irrespective of severity classified by child 
 pugh score.25,26 these data suggest that the maximum daily dose of brv might be reduced by one - third in patients with hepatic impairment.25 in severe renal impairment , the exposure to a single oral dose of 200 mg brv not requiring dialysis ( creatinine clearance < 15 ml / min ) , and renal clearance of three metabolites ( acid , hydroxy , and hydroxyacid ) , was decreased 10-fold in patients with severe renal impairment.24 nevertheless , there are data showing a toxicological coverage for metabolites , without the evidence of any safety issues ( ucb data file ) . based on these observations , a dose adjustment for brv should not be required at any stage of renal dysfunction . 
 the efficacy of brv as add - on therapy in patients with uncontrolled partial seizures has been assessed in six randomized placebo - controlled clinical trials ( table 1).29 in the first two studies , brv as adjunctive therapy in adult patients with partial epilepsy and poor control with 12 concomitant aeds , at different doses ( 5 , 20 , 50 , and 50150 mg / d ) has been evaluated.30,31 french et al30 reported a statistically significant reduction of seizure frequency achieved at the 50 mg / d dose , with high tolerability and infrequent adrs . in particular , the percentage reduction over placebo in focal seizure frequency / week was directly correlated to brv dose , respectively 9.8% at 5 mg / d , 14.9% at 20 mg / d , and 22.1% at 50 mg / d , with a median percent reduction from baseline in seizure frequency / week of 21.7% ( placebo ) , 29.9% ( brv5 ) , 42.6% ( brv20 ) , and 53.1% ( brv50 ) ; 50% responder rates were 16.7% ( placebo ) , 32.0% ( brv5 ) , 44.2% ( brv20 ) , and 55.8% ( brv50 ) ; seizure freedom rates during the 7-week treatment period were 1.9% ( placebo ) , 8.0% ( brv5 ) , 7.7% ( brv20 ) , and 7.7% ( brv50 ) . on the other hand , higher doses of brv would not seem to be more effective , in fact , van paesschen et al31 did not find significant differences in seizure frequency reduction between brv 50 and 150 mg / d during the 7-week maintenance period . 
 in particular , the median seizure frequency / week was 1.00 , 1.96 , and 1.86 in the group treated with brv 50 mg / d , brv 150 mg / d , and placebo , respectively.31 the reduction in baseline - adjusted seizure frequency / week over placebo during the maintenance period was 14.7% in the brv 50 mg / d group and was 13.6% in the brv 150 mg / d group ; however , a significant difference over placebo was observed on several secondary efficacy outcomes ( 10 weeks combined up - titration and maintenance period).31 in fact , after the 10-week treatment period , the median seizure frequency / week was 1.10 , 2.05 , and 1.95 in the brv 50 mg / d , brv 150 mg / d , and placebo groups , respectively . in the maintenance period , 
 50% responder rates were 23.1% for placebo compared with 39.6% for brv50 and 33.3% for brv150 . during the treatment period , 50% responder rates were 17.3% for placebo compared with 35.8% for brv50 and 30.8% for brv150 . 
 nine patients were seizure - free during the 10-week treatment period in the brv50 group ( three in the brv150 group , only one in the placebo group ) . in the study by ryvlin et al,32 
 the efficacy and safety / tolerability of brv ( at doses of 20 , 50 , and 100 mg / d ) in patients with uncontrolled partial seizures with / without secondary generalization , despite treatment with one or two concomitant aeds , was investigated . 
 the percent reduction over placebo in baseline - adjusted seizure frequency / week was 6.8% , 6.5% , and 11.7% in the brv 20 , 50 , and 100 mg / d groups , respectively . 
 the percent reduction over placebo in baseline - adjusted seizure frequency/28 days was 9.2% and 20.5% in the brv 50 and 100 mg / d groups , respectively . 
 median percent reductions from baseline were 30.0% for brv 20 mg / d , 26.8% for brv 50 mg / d , and 32.5% for brv 100 mg / d in comparison to 17.0% for placebo . 
 responder rates ( 50% ) were 27.3% , 27.3% , and 36.0% for brv 20 , 50 , and 100 mg / d , respectively , in comparison to 20.0% for placebo . 
 based on these results , only brv 100 mg / d was able to significantly reduce seizure frequency / week over placebo . 
 indeed , in their randomized placebo - controlled trial , adjunctive brv at a daily dose of 50 mg significantly decreased seizure frequency , while lower dosages ( 5 and 20 mg / d ) did not achieve significant differences.33 in more detail , the percent reduction in partial - onset seizure frequency / week in comparison to placebo was 0.9% ( p=0.885 ) for brv 5 mg / d , 4.1% ( p=0.492 ) for brv 20 mg / d , and 12.8% ( p=0.025 ) for brv 50 mg / d ; in the brv 50 mg / d group , statistical significance was also observed for the 50% responder rate ( brv 32.7% vs placebo 16.7% ) and median percent reduction from baseline in focal seizure frequency / week ( brv 30.5% vs placebo 17.8% ) . 
 recently a randomized , multicenter , double - blind phase iii trial was conducted by klein et al34 to evaluate the efficacy and the safety profile of brv at fixed doses of 100200 mg / d in adult patients with refractory partial onset seizures . 
 responder rate was 21.6% for placebo group , 38.9% for brv 100 mg / d , and 37.8% for brv 200 mg / d ; the percent reduction of partial onset seizures in 28-day frequency was 22.8% for brv 100 mg and 23.2% for brv 200 mg . 
 kwan et al35 conducted a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled trial investigating the safety and tolerability profile of adjunctive brv ( at individualized tailored doses ranging from 20 to 150 mg / d ) in patients with partial or generalized refractory epilepsies . 
 the percent of reduction of focal seizure frequency / week in the brv group in comparison to placebo was 7.3% , while only in the generalized seizures group , the number of seizure days / week decreased from 1.42 at baseline to 0.63 during the treatment period in brv - treated patients ( n=36 ) , and from 1.47 at baseline to 1.26 during the treatment period in the placebo group ( n=13).35 the median percent reduction in baseline - adjusted seizure frequency / week was 26.9% brv vs 18.9% placebo , and the 50% responder rate was 30.3% brv vs 16.7% placebo . 
 the median percent reduction from baseline in generalized seizure days / week was 42.6% vs 20.7% , and the 50% responder rate was 44.4% vs 15.4% in brv - treated and placebo - treated patients , respectively . 
 similar to lev , brv might become a useful aed for the treatment of myoclonic seizures occurring in the setting of idiopathic generalized epilepsies ( eg , juvenile myoclonic epilepsy)36 or of progressive myoclonic epilepsies.37 two randomized , placebo - controlled trials evaluating efficacy and safety of adjunctive brv ( 5150 mg / d ) in unverricht 
 lundborg disease , the most common and less severe form of progressive myoclonic epilepsies,38 failed to show a significant improvement of myoclonus in these patients.39 however , sample size was small ( 106 patients randomized in the two trials ) , and the patients were allowed to receive lev.39 moreover , it is well known that myoclonus may present high inter- and intrapatients variability ( with patients experiencing  good days  and  bad days  ) in unverricht 
 currently an open - label , multicenter , follow - up study to evaluate the long - term safety and efficacy of brv is ongoing ( brite study - nct01339559 ) . 
 finally , to date , in all studies performed , brv was evaluated as an oral tablet formulation , and no data are available about intravenous infusion since the study nct02088957 , aiming at a comparison of the efficacy and safety of intravenous brv vs phenytoin in adult subjects with nonconvulsive electrographic seizures , was terminated for low enrollment . 
 the most commonly reported adverse effects with brv in adults were primarily related to the central nervous system and included somnolence , fatigue , and dizziness.22 these adverse effects were mild to moderate , and the tolerability profile is so excellent that it did not impair therapeutic compliance . in fact , the daily dose of brv ( 20150 mg ) was well tolerated and associated with 6.1% of discontinuation rates due to adrs compared to 5.0% of the placebo group.35 furthermore , adrs induced by brv seem to be time - related , disappearing during the course of treatment . 
 the entity of sedative effects of brv measured by psychometric tests is dose - related in healthy men and appeared clearly from 600 mg upwards as a decrease in attention , motor control , and alertness.22 moreover , the type and the severity of adrs are not influenced by food.22 as demonstrated in healthy males , a twice - daily dosing regimen could be a good clinical practice to reduce blood fluctuations and peak , which might influence the appearance of adverse events.22 no effects on cardiac function were reported even at very high daily dosages ( up to 800 mg / d).40 no data about fertility and/or potential teratogenic effect of brv in humans are currently available ; however , no adverse effects were detected up to the highest tested oral dose of 400 mg / kg / d on fertility , and no effects on pregnancy or fetal development at 600 mg / d were observed in animals.26 seizure aggravation or the appearance of new generalized seizures was rare : three studies reported this adverse event , occurring in similar proportions between placebo and treated group ( 4.3% vs 5.2% , p=0.67).32,33,35 in the above - reported five randomized clinical trials , 1,639 subjects were included in an intention - to - treat analysis ( 1,214 treated with brv and 425 with placebo).3035 no differences were observed in the proportion of subjects experiencing at least one adverse event ( 65.5% with brv vs 60.5% with placebo , p=0.10 ) . 
 most events were mild to moderate ; actually , comprehensive withdrawal rate due to adverse events was quite low and similar in brv and placebo arms ( 5.4% with brv vs 4.2% with placebo , p=0.37 ) . 
 serious adverse events were quite rare and equally distributed ( 2.9% with brv vs 4.4% with placebo , p=0.16 ) . 
 adverse events that were observed in at least 5% of subjects in either group are listed in table 2 . 
 the proportion of patients reporting fatigue and somnolence was significantly higher in brv group compared to placebo ( table 2 ) . 
 irritability was reported in three studies only , and it was present in a small proportion of subjects ( 3% receiving brv , 1% receiving placebo , p=0.36 ) . 
 because of its advantageous pharmacokinetic profile , brv treatment does not appear to influence plasma concentrations of other aeds such as carbamazepine , lamotrigine , lev , oxcarbazepine , topiramate , or valproic acid.41 however , carbamazepine plasma levels are slightly reduced by coadministration of brv ( 400 mg / d ) , while levels of carbamazepine - epoxide are increased in a dose - dependent manner.26,42 this increase of plasma concentration of carbamazepine - epoxide is the result of inhibition by brv of epoxide hydrolase that metabolizes carbamazepine - epoxide into carbamazepine - diol.42 high doses of brv ( 400 mg / d ) cause a moderate decrease of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel plasma levels ( components of oral contraceptives ) but this posological range has no impact on ovulation . 
 no effect on contraceptive disposition is reported at therapeutic doses of brv 100 mg / d.39 interestingly , there is a possible negative interaction between brv and lev , in fact , the concomitant use of both drugs may reduce brv efficacy ; however , this evidence is not robust because the number of patients with concomitant lev was very small , other studies may be useful to assess this apparent pharmacodynamic interaction.33 
 brv is a novel aed whose efficacy in partial epilepsies has been studied and established in five randomized controlled trials;3035 furthermore , two recent meta - analyses have confirmed significant effects for brv in patients with refractory partial seizures.29,43 considering that brv shares part of its mechanism of action with lev and that its ability to inhibit vgsc ( still debated ) is in common with several other aeds , it will be very intriguing to see how this drug will behave in real - life clinical practice . 
 accordingly , it could be hypothesized that brv might possess at least the same effectiveness as lev . 
 based on this hypothesis , brv may be reasonably considered as a valuable add - on aed in patients with partial seizures , also considering its suggested good tolerability . 
 however , specific studies are needed to confirm its efficacy in specific epileptic syndromes , for example , a decreased expression of sv2a in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis has been documented and might represent a pharmacoresistance mechanism in some cases ; however , lev has been reported to be effective.44,45 in addition , because of its good safety and pharmacokinetic profile , brv might be ideal for use in monotherapy , as previously demonstrated for lev.46 finally , few studies have been performed , and more randomized double - blind studies are needed to confirm these considerations and to demonstrate if brv might really confirm its promises and become a new tool for epileptologists .","particular percentage reduction placebo focal seizure frequency week directly correlated brv dose respectively mg mg mg median percent reduction baseline seizure frequency week placebo brv brv brv responder rates placebo brv brv brv seizure freedom rates week treatment period placebo brv brv brv

 brv and lev similarly bind to synaptic vesicle protein 2a , while differentiating for other pharmacological effects ; in fact , brv does not inhibit high voltage ca2 + channels and ampa receptors as lev . 
 furthermore , brv apparently exhibits inhibitory activity on neuronal voltage - gated sodium channels playing a role as a partial antagonist . 
 brv is currently waiting for approval both in the united states and the european union as adjunctive therapy for patients with partial seizures . in patients with photosensitive epilepsy , 
 brv showed a dose - dependent effect in suppressing or attenuating the photoparoxysmal response . in well - controlled trials conducted to date , adjunctive brv demonstrated efficacy and good tolerability in patients with focal epilepsy 
 . 
 brv has a linear pharmacokinetic profile . 
 brv is extensively metabolized and excreted by urine ( only 8%11% unchanged ) . 
 the metabolites of brv are inactive , and hydrolysis of the acetamide group is the mainly involved metabolic pathway ; hepatic impairment probably requires dose adjustment . 
 brv does not seem to influence other antiepileptic drug plasma levels . 
 six clinical trials have so far been completed indicating that brv is effective in controlling seizures when used at doses between 50 and 200 mg / d . 
 the drug is generally well - tolerated with only mild - to - moderate side effects ; this is confirmed by the low discontinuation rate observed in these clinical studies . 
 the most common side effects are related to central nervous system and include fatigue , dizziness , and somnolence ; these apparently disappear during treatment . in this review , we analyzed brv , focusing on the current evidences from experimental animal models to clinical studies with particular interest on potential use in clinical practice . 
 finally , pharmacological properties of brv are summarized with a description of its pharmacokinetics , safety , and potential / known drug  drug interactions ."
"gastrointestinal parasitism has been identified as a complex disease entity constituting a major impediment to efficient and profitable livestock production particularly in sheep and goats all over the world ( 1 , 2 ) . 
 parasites cause direct losses due to death and indirectly due to reduced productivity through reduced feed intake , decreased live weight gain and skin wool or mohair quality ( 3 , 4 ) . 
 these include use of anthelmintics , management of grazing land , proper stocking rate and appropriate rotational strategies ( 5 ) . 
 however , conventional and repeated use of anthelmintics as a means of worm control is now strongly questioned because of increasing development of resistance of parasites to the major anthelmintic groups ( 6 , 7 ) . 
 conversely , grazing management and biological control are non - chemical methods of parasite control that have proved to be effective ( 6 ) . among the alternative methods of control currently available , 
 the breeding of resistant animals in order to improve the host resistance and/or resistance to parasite infestation or infection seems to represent one of the most promising options ( 811 ) . 
 therefore , sheep that are well nourished will grow and reproduce faster and are better able to withstand the effects of worm infestation than those on low plane of nutrition ( 11 ) . 
 research has shown that increased dietary intake of metabolisable protein and energy with high quality pasture can directly promote host resistance and resilience to worm infection ( 12 ) . 
 protein energy deficiencies is a important cause of defective t cell function ( 13 , 14 ) and t cells have been shown to play vital role in mediating acquired resistance to haemonchosis in sheep ( 13 ) . 
 bowie ( 15 ) had shown the beneficial effect of treatment with cayenne pepper , garlic powder , and diatomaceous earth on the packed cell volume and the faecal egg count of sheep infected with haemonchus contortus while cassava foliage adequately reduced the adverse effects of gastrointestinal nematode infections in goats , in particular when offered as silage ( 16 ) . 
 there have been previous attempts aimed at determining the effect of protein of various origins on gastrointestinal parasitism ( 1719 ) . 
 the relative importance of energy and the dominant effect of protein supply have been partly researched on in the development of resistance to infection ( 20 ) . 
 this has generated an argument on whether the control of helminths in livestock is more sensitive to protein than to energy . 
 therefore , the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of varied protein - energy combinations on clinical presentation , performance , haematology and adult worm load of gastro intestinally parasitized , west africa dwarf lambs that have been managed semi - intensively .

 the need to minimize production losses in animal husbandry practices is of paramount importance especially among young animals where ability to thrive and function optimally is threatened by infections like gastrointestinal helminths . 
 the diarrhea observed in all the groups in this study is an evidence of parasitic gastroenteritis ( 25 ) . 
 t. columbriformis , an important contributor to parasitic gastroenteritis complex accounted for between 43 and 57% of the total worms recovered at necropsy in all the groups and might have been an important contributor to the diarrhea observed . 
 this finding agrees with previous report by chiejina ( 26 ) who associated diarrhea in sheep with the non - blood sucking helminths such as t. columbriformis . 
 such helminths cause proliferative gastrophy , catarrhal inflammation and epithelial ulcerations , thereby resulting in morphologic and functional damage of the gastro - intestinal tract . 
 this subsequently leads to reduced absorption of water and electrolyte and finally diarrhea as a consequence ( 26 , 27 ) . 
 similarly , the anorexia observed in this study was obvious by day 20 post infection in g1 and g3 lambs fed on low protein diets . in ruminants , cobalt deficiency and a heavy infestation with trichostrongylids 
 this is further corroborated by the previous finding of steel ( 28 ) who observed reduced feed in - take when fec was above 3000 epg in sheep infected with trichostrongylids . 
 animals in g1 and 3 had fec of ( 3333.33210.82 ) and 1066.6742.16 at day 60 post infection respectively . 
 the absence of anorexia in groups ( g2 and 4 ) , that received high plane of protein is an indication of the ability of high protein diet to mitigate the negative impact of infection . 
 increased availability of protein has been reported to reduce the degree of anorexia in sheep with t. colubriformis infection ( 20 ) . 
 ( 29 ) attributed reduction in appetite in helminth - infected lambs to be immunostimulatory in origin , which allow for selective feeding particularly for high protein diets . 
 this is necessary because of priority sequestration of amino acid by gastro intestinal tract for repairs , development and expression of local cell mediated responses . 
 this might explain why lambs in g1 and g3 with low protein diets showed obvious anorexia , with high fec at the peak of infection . 
 in all groups , weight changes showed significant ( p < 0.05 ) increase despite significant increase in fec especially from days 30 and 60 . 
 the improved weight of animals in g4 , followed by g2 compared to other experimental animals attest to the importance of protein and energy diets in improving productivity despite the effect of gastrointestinal parasitism . 
 this finding agrees with the earlier report ( 19 ) , in wad goats experimentally infected with h. contortus and t. columbriformis and supplemented with dietary protein . 
 balanced energy - protein supplementation might have afforded opportunity for rumen to function optimally ; thus enhancing microbial flora synthesis leading to increase in weight . 
 a 60% increase in protein content of diet was associated with 50% increase in growth rate while 20% increase in energy content resulted in doubling of growth rate over ten weeks period in weaned merino sheep infected with black scour worms ( 30 ) . 
 the same phenomenon might have been responsible for the significant weight gain in all groups especially those on high plane of protein and energy . 
 ( 31 ) observed a strong negative correlation between an initial weight and t. columbriformis worm count after challenge in 8-month - old merino sheep . 
 the significant decrease in fec observed at the latter part of this experiment in all groups indicate that the effect of energy protein supplementation in enhancing immune response appears to be most effective at the latter stages of parasitic acquisition by the host . 
 this observation corroborates an earlier report ( 20 ) , where effect of protein supplementation became manifest 15 weeks post infection . 
 however , the significant decrease in fec on day 90 post experiment in g1 and g2 compared to g3 and g4 could show the detrimental effects of low energy content on fecundity or oviposition of higher worm load . 
 18 ) on xhosa lop - eared goats fed supplementary acacia karroo leaves following experimental haemonchosis . 
 this decrease in fec as seen g1 and g2 with low energy diets in this study was found to be incompatible with research into roles of energy in immune response to gastrointestinal helminth parasitism ( 3234 ) . 
 the lower fec reported in g1 and g2 with higher worm load and conversely higher fec reported in g3 and g4 with lower worm burden demonstrate positive effects of protein supplementation on worm load . 
 the effects of low energy may have affected negatively on the fecundity of worm in the infected animals . 
 contrary to research stating that reduced fec in lambs provide a selection criterion for worm resistance , which has been found to be heritable characteristic ( 3537 ) , the present study thus showed that , the use of reduced fec in lamb for worm resistance might not be true in animal fed on low energy diet . 
 the pcv of all groups did not vary significantly ( p < 0.05 ) as the experiment progressed except in g4 . 
 the provision of additional protein to infected animals are able to maintain normal rate of growth suggesting that , if protein supply is high enough , then , it may possible to keep animal performance in the face of larval challenge ( 38 ) . 
 the recovery of blood sucking helminths such as h. contortus in low number compared to non - blood sucking helminths is a possible explanation for the ability of the animal to maintain normal pcv throughout the experimental period . 
 equally , the reasons adduced for the improved pcv may hold true for rbc and hb concentration . furthermore 
 , the presence of parasites such as m. benedini and p. cervi in low number , compared to others might have been responsible for the parameters observed . 
 this is because such parasites do not cause much damage , unless present in large number , which was not the case in this study . 
 diet low in energy and high in protein as in g2 supplemented lambs appear to be the most preferred diet combination in mitigating the deleterious effects of gastrointestinal helminth infection .","mean sd pre infection ages body weights wad lambs fed varied energy protein densities superscripts rows differ significantly p among groups

rbc experimental animals varied significantly p day among groups","background : the performance and parasitology of semi - intensively managed west african dwarf ( wad ) lambs were evaluated following exposure to gastrointestinal helminth infected paddock and varied protein - energy feeds.methods:twenty four lambs obtained from the department of animal breeding and genetics and brought to directorate of university farm ( dufarm ) of federal university of agriculture abeokuta , ogun state , nigeria , where the research was carried out in 2014 , were grouped into four each containing six animals based on different energy - protein feed combination thus ; group 1(g1 ) low energy low protein , group 2 ( g2 ) low energy high protein , group 3 ( g3 ) high energy low protein and group 4 ( g4 ) high energy high protein . 
 experimental animals were supplemented with concentrate feed after grazing on daily in a nematode infected paddock . 
 clinical signs of infection were monitored . 
 live weight , faecal egg count ( fec ) , worm counts , packed cell volume ( pcv ) , haemoglobin concentration ( hb ) and red blood cell count ( rbc ) were determined using standard methods.results:anorexia and intermittent diarrhea were the observed signs . 
 worm counts did not differ significantly ( p=0.309 ) among the groups . 
 the weight and fec differed significantly ( p<0.05 ) across the days and among the groups , while haematological parameters increased significantly ( p<0.05 ) across the days and among the groups.conclusion:lambs in g2 followed by g4 showed improved parameters and superior performance when compared to the other groups . 
 it is therefore recommended that feed high in protein content is capable of mitigating deleterious effect of gastrointestinal helminth parasitism ."

 to assess the possibility that dp thymocytes spontaneously terminated cd8 coreceptor synthesis even in the absence of tcr 
 cd3 signals , we examined dp thymocytes   from tcr mice by the coreceptor reexpression assay . 
 tcr thymocytes can not express conventional  tcr   complexes and , consequently , can not differentiate beyond   the dp stage of development ( 21 ) . to enrich for dp thymocytes that might have committed to the cd4 or cd8   t  cell lineages , we electronically sorted for cd48 and   cd48 transitional cell populations and utilized the coreceptor reexpression assay to determine the coreceptor molecules they were actively synthesizing ( fig . 
 1 , a and b ) . in   the coreceptor reexpression assay , preexisting surface cd4   and 
 cd8 coreceptor molecules are removed from the   sorted cells by treatment with low doses of pronase , and the   stripped cells then placed into single cell suspension cultures for 14 h. metabolic activity of cultured cells is inhibited at 4c , so that cell surface coreceptor reexpression   does not occur ( fig . 1 a and b , middle columns ) . however ,   cells cultured at 37c do reexpress the cd4 and/or cd8   coreceptor molecules that they are actively synthesizing . 
 indeed , we have previously demonstrated that coreceptor   reexpression in this assay requires active coreceptor transcription and protein synthesis ( 8) . interestingly , virtually   all cd48 sorted cells from tcr dp thymocytes reexpressed both cd4 and cd8 coreceptors and so reappeared   as dp cells ( fig . 
 identical results were obtained   with cd48 sorted cells from tcr mice ( fig . 1 b , top ) . 
 that is , none of the dp thymocytes present in tcr   mice had selectively terminated either cd4 or cd8 coreceptor synthesis , indicating that none had undergone lineage commitment . 
 thus , these results indicated that lineage   commitment did not occur spontaneously in immature dp   thymocytes but might be dependent upon signals transduced by surface tcr  cd3 complexes .   to assess directly the role of tcr 
 cd3 signals in inducing lineage commitment in dp thymocytes , we assessed   dp thymocytes from experimentally induced rag2 mice . 
 rag2 mice fail to express any clonotypic tcr chain because they are unable to recombine any tcr gene locus .   as a result , 
 rag2 thymocytes are arrested at the cd48   ( double - negative , dn ) stage of development ( 23 ) . however 
 , rag thymocytes can be induced to differentiate   further into dp cells by either sublethal -irradiation ( 26 ,   27 ) or by injection of anti - cd3 mab ( 28 , 29 ) ( fig . 
 1 , a   and b , left column ) . induced rag dp thymocytes did not   further differentiate into phenotypically mature t cells as   thymocytes from stimulated rag mice that appeared   cd48 or cd48 ( fig . 
 1 , a and b , left columns ) were   predominantly precursor cells that spontaneously became   cd48 in overnight culture ( data not shown ; reference   30 ) . even though sublethal -irradiation and anti - cd3   injection both induced generation of rag dp thymocytes ( fig . 
 that is , sublethal -irradiation did   not detectably stimulate cd3 signal transduction as revealed by the absence of cd5 upregulation , whereas injection of anti - cd3 mab did stimulate cd3 signal transduction and cd5 upregulation ( fig . 
 2 ) . assessment of cd48   and cd48 sorted cells from -irradiated rag2 mice   by the coreceptor reexpression assay revealed that none had   undergone lineage commitment ( fig . 
 assessment of cd48 sorted cells from anti - cd3 induced rag2 mice revealed the presence of cd4-committed dp thymocytes that had selectively terminated cd8   coreceptor synthesis , as well as the presence of uncommitted dp thymocytes ( fig . 
 the cd4-committed thymocytes that were present in anti - cd3induced rag2   mice expressed the phenotype of newly committed thymocytes in that they were hsa , thymic shared antigen   ( tsa)-1 ( data not shown ) . 
 in contrast , anti - cd3induced   rag2 thymocytes had no cd8-committed cells among   either cd48 or cd48 sorted cell populations ( fig . 1 ,   a and b ) . 
 thus , these results ( a ) confirm that dp thymocytes do not undergo lineage commitment in the absence of tcr 
 cd3 signals , and ( b ) demonstrate that cd3   signals stimulated by anti - cd3 mabs are sufficient to induce dp thymocytes to selectively terminate cd8 coreceptor synthesis and commit to the cd4 lineage , even in   the absence of clonotypic tcr chains .   to determine whether signals transduced by tcr chains   are indispensable for induction of cd4 commitment , we   generated double knockout rag2tcr mice . in vivo   injection of anti - cd3 mabs into ragtcr double   knockout mice induced the generation of dp thymocytes ,   as has been described ( 31 ) , and signaled these cells to upregulate cd5 expression ( fig . 
 interestingly , we found that   cd48 sorted thymocytes from these anti - cd3injected   mice did contain cd4-committed cells that had selectively   terminated cd8 coreceptor synthesis ( see fig . 
 , no cd8-committed cells were detected in either   cd48 or cd48 sorted cell populations ( fig . 
 1 , a and   b ) . these results demonstrate that cd3-transduced signals   can induce cd4 commitment in dp thymocytes in the absence of clonotypic tcr chains and in the absence of   tcr chains . to determine whether signals transduced by tcr   chains were able to induce cd4 commitment , we assessed   lineage commitment in dp thymocytes from rag2 mice   that expressed a chimeric transgenic protein consisting of   the external and transmembrane domains of human cd25   and the cytosolic domains of tcr ( 24 ) . 
 the extracellular   domain of this transgenic protein is recognized by anti - tac   mab . 
 injection of anti - tac mab into ragtt mice   induced the generation of dp thymocytes ( fig . 
 1 a ) , as   previously reported ( 24 ) , and signaled them to upregulate   cd5 expression ( fig . 
 we found that cd48 sorted   thymocytes from these mice did contain cd4-committed   cells , but did not contain any cd8-committed cells in either cd48 or cd48 sorted cell populations ( see fig .   1 , a and b ) . 
 these results demonstrate that signals transduced by the cytosolic portion of tcr chains are sufficient to induce dp thymocytes to selectively terminate   cd8 coreceptor synthesis and to undergo cd4 commitment . 
 next , we wished to evaluate the relationship between   cd5 upregulation and cd4 commitment in anti - cd3 signaled rag2 thymocytes . in vivo injection of a single   dose of either 10 or 250 g of anti - cd3 mab  induced   substantial numbers of dp thymocytes in rag mice when   assayed 8 d later ( fig . 
 while both injection doses induced differentiaton to the dp stage , we reasoned that only   the high dose might persist long enough in vivo to stimulate   a subsequent cd3 signal after dp thymocytes appeared . 
 indeed , only dp thymocytes from high dose injected animals   had upregulated cd5 expression , and only dp thymocytes   from high dose injected animals contained cd4-committed thymocytes ( fig . 
 3 ) . dp thymocytes from low dose injected animals were cd5 and remained uncommitted   ( fig . 
 we conclude that cd4 commitment requires   cd3 signals in dp thymocytes that are of sufficient intensity to upregulate surface cd5 expression . 
 finally , having observed that a single injection of antibody was sufficient to stimulate cd3 or tcr chains to   transduce signals that upregulated cd5 surface expression   and induced cd4 commitment but not cd8 commitment , we assessed whether cd8-committed cells might   appear in rag2 thymi upon antibody restimulation . in   fig . 4 , 
 rag2 mice were injected with anti - cd3 mab   on both days 0 and 8 , and then assessed 4 d later on day 12 . 
 thymocytes were sorted into cd48 and cd48 populations and then assessed for coreceptor synthesis by the   coreceptor reexpression assay . 
 we found that cd48 thymocytes contained cd4-committed cells that had selectively terminated cd8 coreceptor synthesis ( fig . 
 4 , middle   row ) , but neither sorted population contained cd8-committed cells ( fig . 
 , cd8-committed cells did not appear in rag2 thymi despite a   second antibody injection and despite assessment on day 12   after the initial injection of antibody ( fig . 
 , we   also failed to detect cd8-committed thymocytes on days   28 and 35 after antibody injection ( data not shown ) . 
 the present study demonstrates that immature dp thymocytes do not spontaneously terminate synthesis of either   cd4 or cd8 coreceptor molecules . 
 rather , selective termination of coreceptor synthesis by immature dp thymocytes   requires signals transduced by either cd3 or tcr chains ,   and can occur in signaled dp thymocytes that lack clonotypic tcr chains . 
 interestingly , cd3-signaled dp thymocytes upregulated cd5 expression and selectively terminated cd8 coreceptor synthesis , but did not selectively   terminate cd4 coreceptor synthesis . 
 thus , cd4 commitment is induced in dp thymocytes by cd3 signals that are   of sufficient intensity to upregulate cd5 expression . 
 the results of the present study are not readily compatible with either instructional ( 1 , 2 ) or stochastic / selection   ( 37 ) models of lineage commitment . 
 that is , the instructional model can not explain the presence of any lineage - committed rag2 thymocytes in response to lineage - neutral cd3 and tcr signals , whereas the stochastic / selection   model can not explain why cd3 and tcr signals only   induced rag2 thymocytes to become cd4 committed   without inducing an equal number to become cd8 committed . 
 in contrast with these two models of lineage commitment , the present results are concordant with the asymmetric commitment model of lineage commitment ( 8 , 13 ) . 
 that is , our results are consistent with the concept that cd4   commitment , unlike cd8 commitment , can occur in the   absence of lineage - specific signals . 
 importantly , the present   results extend the asymmetric commitment model by demonstrating that cd4 commitment does not occur spontaneously in unsignaled dp thymocytes , but rather is induced   by lineage - neutral signals transduced by cd3 and/or tcr   chains . 
 importantly , we found that cd3 signaling did not induce all dp thymocytes in the present study to become   cd4 committed , as only a small minority of cd3-signaled   rag2 thymocytes terminated cd8 coreceptor synthesis ,   even though all dp thymocytes had upregulated cd5 surface   expression . 
 this observation is consistent with our recent   finding that only a small fraction of cd5 dp thymocytes   in normal mice have undergone lineage commitment , with   most cd5 dp thymocytes remaining lineage uncommitted ( 20 ) . 
 our current perspective is that cd3 signaling   drives cd5 dp thymocytes to become cd5 , at which   point they developmentally await the induction of lineage - specific signals . if lineage - specific signals are generated ,   perhaps by notch proteins ( 12 ) , cd5 dp thymocytes terminate cd4 coreceptor synthesis and become cd8 committed . 
 but if lineage - specific signals are not generated ,   cd5 dp thymocytes terminate cd8 coreceptor synthesis   and become cd4 committed . 
 we do not know how long   cd5 dp thymocytes await the appearance of lineage - specific signals before terminating cd8 coreceptor synthesis ,   and we do not know whether there are intrathymic signals   that regulate the timing of this event . 
 finally , the present results are remarkable in their demonstration that cd3-signaled dp thymocytes could undergo cd4 commitment even in the absence of clonotypic   tcr chains . of course , dp thymocytes express surface   molecules in addition to clonotypic tcr chains that can   stimulate cd3 signaling , such as cd2 , cd5 , thy-1 , and   ly6 ( 3234 ) . 
 consequently , it is conceivable that engagement of such nonclonotypic molecules by intrathymic ligands   can inefficiently mimic clonotypic tcr chains in their   ability to stimulate cd3 signals that induce cd5 dp thymocytes to become cd5 , and so eventually to become   cd4 committed . 
 the absence of cd5 dp thymocytes and   cd4-committed cells in tcr mice does not rule out intrathymic signaling by nonclonotypic molecules because   surface cd3 expression is probably too low on tcr   thymocytes to transduce such signals . 
 indeed , stimulation   of cd3 signals by nonclonotypic receptors may provide one   explanation for the appearance of small numbers of cd4-committed dp thymocytes in mhc - deficient thymi ( 8) . 
 purified populations of cd48 thymocytes ( a )   and cd48 thymocytes ( b ) were obtained by electronic cell sorting according to the indicated sorting gates superimposed on the starting thymocyte   populations ( left columns ) . sorted thymocyte populations were stripped of surface coreceptor molecules by treatment with low doses of pronase , after   which they were placed in suspension cultures at 4c ( middle panels ) or 37c ( right panels ) for 1216 h and restained for cd4 and cd8 surface expression . 
 the coreceptor reexpression assay detects the coreceptor molecules that individual thymocytes synthesized during the 37c culture , and is dependent   upon new transcription and new protein synthesis ( 8) . sorted thymocytes that reexpress both cd4 and cd8 coreceptor proteins are lineage - uncommitted cells ; those reexpressing only cd4 are cd4 committed ; and those reexpressing only cd8 are cd8 committed . 
 cells cultured at 4c do not reexpress   surface coreceptor molecules so that their cd4cd8 histograms reflect whatever coreceptor molecules that potentially remain after pronase treatment   ( middle columns ) . as we have previously described ( 8) , 
 the anti - cd4 mab used to prepare thymocytes for cell sorting minimally interferes with stripping   of surface cd4 molecules by pronase , resulting in a small number of residual cd4 molecules remaining on the cell surface . 
 consequently , to highlight   changes in coreceptor reexpression during 37c cultures , histogram boxes were drawn based on the 4c profiles of each sorted and pronase - stripped cell   population . the frequency of cells in each box is indicated . 
 the number of the thymocytes obtained in these experimental mice were the following :   tcr ( 9  10 cells ) , -irradiated rag2 ( 4  10 cells ) , anti - cd3 mab  injected rag2 ( 1.1  10 cells ) , anti - cd3 mab  injected   ragtcr ( 8  10 cells ) , and anti - tac mab 
 thymocytes from the indicated experimental mice were stained   with anti - cd5 mab ( solid line ) or an irrelevant antibody ( shaded curve ) . 
 cd5 expression on normal b6 thymocytes stained at the same time as a   positive control is also shown for comparison ( dotted line ) . 
 rag mice received one intraperitoneal injection of either 250 g   or 10 g of affinity - purified anti - cd3 mab . 
 8 d later , thymocytes   were sorted according to the indicated gates and assessed for lineage   commitment by the coreceptor   reexpression assay ( left panels ) . 
 unsorted thymocytes were placed   in culture for 12 h at 4c , at   which temperature thymocyte   phenotype is stable , and then assessed for surface cd5 expression   ( right panels ) . 
 the dotted line represents cd5 expression on normal b6 thymocytes   stained at the same time as a positive control and is shown for comparison . 
 the number of thymocytes obtained on day 8 were 11.5  10 cells and   34  10 cells with the injection of 250 g and 10 g , respectively . 
 cd8-committed thymocytes do not appear in rag2 thymi   even after two injections of anti - cd3 mab . 
 rag2 mice were injected   with 250 g of affinity - purified anti - cd3 mab on both day 0 and 8 .   on day 12 , thymocytes were harvested , sorted into cd48 and   cd48 populations , and assessed by the coreceptor reexpression assay   for appearance of cd4-committed and cd8-committed cells .","assess possibility dp thymocytes spontaneously terminated cd coreceptor synthesis even absence tcr cd signals examined dp thymocytes tcr mice coreceptor reexpression assay

day thymocytes harvested sorted cd cd populations assessed coreceptor reexpression assay appearance cdcommitted cdcommitted cells","as a consequence of positive selection in the thymus , immature cd4 + 8 + double - positive ,   [ dp ] thymocytes selectively terminate synthesis of one coreceptor molecule and , as a result ,   differentiate into either cd4 + or cd8 + t cells . 
 the decision by individual dp thymocytes to   terminate synthesis of one or the other coreceptor molecule is referred to as lineage commitment . 
 previously , we reported that the intrathymic signals that induced commitment to the   cd4 versus cd8 t cell lineages were markedly asymmetric . 
 notably , cd8 commitment appeared to require lineage - specific signals , whereas cd4 commitment appeared to occur in the   absence of lineage - specific signals by default . 
 consequently , it was unclear whether cd4 commitment , as revealed by selective termination of cd8 coreceptor synthesis , occurred in all dp   thymocytes , or whether cd4 commitment occurred only in t cell receptor ( tcr)cd3-signaled   dp thymocytes . here 
 , we report that selective termination of cd8 coreceptor synthesis does   not occur in dp thymocytes spontaneously . 
 rather , cd4 commitment in dp thymocytes requires signals transduced by either cd3 or  chains , which can signal cd4 commitment even   in the absence of clonotypic tcr chains ."
"genetically modified plant - pesticidal crops with constitutive expression of insecticidal protein ( such as the cry proteins derived from the bacterium bacillus thuringiensis ) require some form of resistance management program to delay the rapid evolution of resistance in targeted insects to expressed toxins . 
 because bt - toxins have substantial sub - lethal effects that could hasten resistance , resistance management for these toxins has focused on a high dose - refuge strategy . 
 this strategy relies on plants expressing a sufficiently high dose of the toxin to kill > 95% of susceptible and resistant heterozygous insects , while refuges of non - transformed crops allow large numbers of susceptible insects to survive ( gould 1988 , van rie 1991 , roush 1994 ) . 
 this strategy can delay the evolution of resistance to the crop , if , among other factors , the refuges produce a sufficient number of susceptible insects . 
 the 1998 scientific advisory panel to the environmental protection agency of the u.s.a . suggested that a refuge should produce 500 susceptible insects for each insect expected to survive in the transgenic crop ( sap - epa 1998 ) . 
 the emphasis has primarily been on size of the refuge ( proportion of overall habitat ) needed to meet this or equivalent goals , but one alternative is to increase the efficiency of a refuge by producing more susceptible insects per unit area . 
 this could be accomplished by the use of alternative hosts such as pigeon pea and velvetleaf ( craig 1998 ) . 
 caprio ( 2001 ) suggested that by altering the spatial structure of refuges one could impact the degree of isolation between refuges and transgenic fields and affect the impact of source - sink dynamics . 
 source - sink dynamics describe ecosystems in which some populations have net emigration and in which there is net population growth ( sources ) and other populations ( sinks ) where there is net immigration and in which deaths exceed births ( pulliam 1988 ) . utilizing computer simulations , caprio ( 2001 ) modeled varying degrees of isolation between refuges and transgenic fields and found two different trends that resulted in an optimal degree of refuge isolation . when refuges were fine - grained ( insects experience both habitats almost at random ) , with little isolation between refuges and transgenic fields , susceptible females emerging in the refuges laid many of their eggs in the most common habitat , transgenic fields , where few offspring would be expected to survive . 
 the transgenic fields became sink habitats for susceptible moths , and fewer susceptible moths were therefore produced in the refuges and the rate of resistance evolution was increased . at the other extreme , if isolation ( decreased dispersal between the two habitats ) between refuges and transgenic fields was too great , large numbers of moths were produced in refuges , but few of these moths moved into transgenic fields , increasing the likelihood that resistant moths that survived in this toxic habitat would mate with each other . between these two extremes was an optimal amount of isolation that would delay resistance the longest . 
 caprio ( 2001 ) suggested that isolation between refuges and transgenic fields could be manipulated by altering the width of refuges embedded within the transgenic fields . 
 1 m ) refuges represented the minimum amount of isolation , while refuges placed in separate fields would be representative of more isolated refuges . in each case the total proportion of habitat devoted to refuges would remain identical . 
 there would have to be many more narrow width refuges with less transgenic crop between each in the former case ( e.g. one embedded refuge for each 20 rows , versus one refuge for every 1200 rows when refuges were 60 rows wide ) . 
 the use of relatively narrow ( 16 - 100 row wide ) refuges embedded into transgenic cotton , comprising 5% of the area , is a compromise between sprayed and unsprayed refuges . 
 are mandated by the us - epa to be larger than unsprayed refuges , but may be treated with a non - bt based foliar product . 
 sprayed refuges have the potential disadvantage that use of highly efficacious sprays could make these refuges ineffective . fields with sprayed refuges also utilize two technologies simultaneously , the conventional technology applied to the refuges and the transgenic technology ( a high dose transgenic crop produces too few individuals to act as a refuge for the conventionally treated refuges ) . in essence , the conventional technology is being utilized to protect the transgenic technology . 
 spatially separate unsprayed refuges are ideal because they are refuges not only for transgenic crops , but also for areas treated with conventional insecticides . 
 unfortunately , these refuges are easy to manage in a manner different than the surrounding bt - crop ( reduced fertilizer input or irrigation , different planting dates , etc . ) and have therefore become a target for minimizing compliance to resistance management guidelines . the embedded refuge concept attempts to deploy refuges within the transgenic crop in small enough units 
 so that growers are unlikely to manage these refuges differently than the surrounding bt - crop . 
 this has the disadvantage , relative to true unsprayed refuges , that the embedded refuges are sprayed whenever the bt - crop is sprayed , but attempts to minimize the likelihood of non - compliance with resistance management guidelines . 
 the caprio ( 2001 ) model predicted , that in systems where pests persist for multiple generations in fields , that as refuges increase in width ( but overall proportion remains the same ) , the density of the population in the refuges should increase . 
 the null hypothesis tested here is that refuge population density is independent of refuge width ( assuming that proportion of the total habitat devoted to refuges remains constant ) for the two major insect pests the tobacco budworm , heliothis virescens ( fabricius ) , and the cotton bollworm , helicoverpa zea ( boddie ) of the mid - south cotton agroecosystem . 
 we also hypothesize that if insects are emerging primarily from local refuges a decline in egg density should be seen as one moves away from the refuge into the bt - crop . 
 alternatively , if insects are moving into fields from outside sources , no relationship should exist between refuges and insect egg density within this crop . 
 in each of two years , 1996 and 1997 , 3 replicates were used , each replicate consisting of a farm with three different embedded refuge widths , including narrow ( 16 - 24 rows wide ) , medium ( 32 - 48 rows wide ) and wide ( 80 - 96 rows wide ) refuges in a randomized design . 
 each refuge was surrounded with the appropriate amount of bollgard transgenic cotton expressing the cry 1ac gene isolated from b. thuringiensis so that the overall proportion of refuge cotton was 4% of the cotton habitat . 
 because of the large size needed for each replicate ( > 140 ha ) , grower fields were used , and actual refuge widths depended on grower planter width . 
 cotton fields in mississippi generally remain furrowed throughout the year so that rows are clearly visible to growers prior to planting . 
 this allowed growers to plant their bt - cotton and then fill in the non - bt refuges . 
 this particular crop management practice simplified the use of embedded refuges , an advantage that may not be available in many other crops . at each farm the three refuge widths for a randomized complete block design with were replicated with farms as blocks . 
 each farm was sampled once per week and these counts were pooled to produce seasonal totals . 
 four sites were sampled at each refuge , the refuge and three distances away from the refuge . 
 the refuge itself was sampled by randomly selecting plants from two randomly selected rows that were in the central third of the refuge . 
 the other three samples sites at each refuge were in the transgenic cotton at distances of , in 1996 , 20 , 40 and 60 meters from the refuge edge , while in 1997 the distances were 40 , 80 and 120 meters . 
 at each site , 40 randomly selected plants in one row were sampled for the presence of eggs , for a total of 160 plants per refuge . in 1997 eggs 
 were collected and identified to species ( budworm or bollworm ) using an elisa test ( zeng et al . 
 the eggs are morphologically indistinguishable , no attempt was made to separate budworm from bollworm larvae in that year . at the end of the season , 
 3 replicates of 10 row feet from the center of the refuge as well as 10 row feet of the surrounding bt - cotton ( 8 rows from the refuge - bt cotton interface ) were harvested by hand for yield estimation . to reduce variance due to local field effects , 
 the ratio of yield of refuge cotton compared to yield of surrounding bt - cotton was analyzed . 
 bt - cotton was utilized as a standard ( adjusting for local environmental effects such as soil , other pests and pathogens because the two yields were from cottons grown in a similar environment ) against which the yield of the refuges could be compared . 
 analysis of variance was performed on the mean egg density found in each refuge on each farm , with farms and refuge widths as categories . 
 homogeneity of variance between treatments was tested using a levene 's test ( wilkinson et al . 
 a slope of the regression line significantly different from zero was considered evidence of an effect of distance on egg density and an indication that eggs were being oviposited by adults originating in the refuges ( if the slope was negative ) .

 a significant effect of refuge size on combined h. virescens and h. zea egg density was observed over the 1996 sample periods ( f=5.49 ; df=2,30 ; p=0.026 ) .

 the yield in the narrowest refuges was 81% of the yield of surrounding bt - cotton , while the largest refuges yielded only 71% ( fig .

 as predicted by modeling , we found significantly higher egg densities in wider refuges for tobacco budworm , at least for the combined ( 1996 ) and the 1997 h. virescens data . increased isolation between the refuges and bt - cotton allowed more of the reproductive effort of females emerging in refuges to be expended in the refuges , thus increasing the population of moths in the refuges . 
 theoretical considerations ( caprio 2001 ) suggest that this increase in population density would more than compensate for the increased isolation of the refuges . while individual moths emerging in the refuges would have a lower probability of mating with a resistant individual in the bt - crop , the overall probability that a resistant individual mating with an insect emerging out of the refuge would increase because of the greater refuge population size . the fine - scale structure of egg density within refuges was not investigated . 
 larval densities and yield loss are expected to differ within the refuge in relation to distance from the transgenic crop ( alstad and andow 1995 ) . 
 however , the sampled eggs reflect adult dispersal patterns rather than larval movement patterns and interactions with crop types . 
 adult h. virescens do not oviposit preferentially on either host type ( parker 1997 ) . 
 given the distance over which we had to measure outside of the refuges to detect declines in oviposition , we believe it unlikely that egg density varied significantly with refuges and feel that the densities measured reflect mean densities for the entire refuge . the ability to discriminate and observe the differences between h. zea and h. virescens using the elisa in the 1997 study revealed important differences in the biology of these two insects . 
 populations of h. virescens are primarily restricted to cotton for four generations during the summer , with smaller populations on some wild hosts ( stadelbacher et al . 
 one would then expect that fields are initially infested with moths moving in from springtime wild hosts , but then a substantial proportion of subsequent populations originate in cotton fields . 
 this behavior increases the potential effects of the source - sink dynamics , and is reflected in the significant effects of refuge size and a significant decline in egg density as distance from the refuges increased . 
 h. zea , on the other hand , infests primarily corn during the first two generations of the summer , and only after corn ceases to be a suitable habitat in mid - july do bollworm moths begin to move into cotton and possibly other alternative hosts ( neunzig 1969 ) . 
 lopez et al . ( 1995 ) also found that h. zea is more mobile than h. virescens during mid - summer months in texas . 
 this biological pattern limits the effects of source - sink dynamics because many of the eggs found in a cotton field will have come from moths dispersing into cotton from other fields or habitats rather than immediately adjacent refuges . 
 this is consistent with the lack of an effect of refuge size for this species , and with the lack of a significant decline in egg density with distance from the refuges . 
 these data , combined with the results from caprio ( 2001 ) , suggest that source - sink dynamics can be important for some species in agricultural systems . 
 the studies suggest that a suitable improvement in the strategy to delay the evolution of resistance to bt - cotton would be to deploy embedded refuges , strips of non - bt cotton planted within bt - cotton . 
 it is essential that such strips be wide enough to generate sufficient isolation between the refuges and bt - cotton . as a rough guide 
 , the mean proportion of eggs oviposited in refuges by females emerging in the refuges should be the inverse of the mean rate of increase in population size per generation . 
 if the mean rate of increase per generation is 5 fold , the embedded refuges should be wide enough so that at least 20% of the eggs oviposited by females emerging in refuges would be laid in refuges . 
 this would ensure that the population size in the refuges would approximately remain constant over the course of the season . 
 the results presented in this paper suggest that refuges of 2448 m wide are probably not wide enough to generate this isolation for h. virescens , and embedded refuges should be at least 50 m wide . 
 a disadvantage of conventional unsprayed refuges , which can be physically separated from bt - fields , is that such refuges may be subject to illicit insecticidal sprays . 
 embedded refuges could reduce such proscribed spraying by reducing the likelihood of micro - management of pest populations in such refuges , essentially hiding the refuge within the crop at large . 
 however , for pests such as h. zea that have significant survivorship in bt - fields , a mechanism must exist to allow embedded refuges to be sprayed when the surrounding bt - fields are sprayed . in these cases , 
 spraying of refuges should occur only when bt - fields are treated for the targeted pests . in the absence of synergy between the bt - crop and the applied insecticide 
 , one would expect equal mortality of all genotypes related to bt - resistance in both bt - fields and refuges , and the over - spraying should not impact the rate of resistance evolution ( though in comparison , an unsprayed refuge , in which the refuge population was not exposed to the insecticide , would actually benefit from applications applied to the bt - cotton ) . 
 embedded refuges , while maintaining some isolation between refuges and bt - fields , would also help limit the maximal distance between refuges and bt - plants . further , in contrast to sprayed refuges , embedded refuges would acts as refuges for all pesticides used for lepidopteran control in cotton ( except when bt - fields are over - sprayed ) . because bt - fields are expected to produce very low numbers of h. virescens , they will not act as refuges for conventional sprayed fields , and one would expect that resistance to conventional insecticides will continue to evolve at a rate almost independent of the presence of plants expressing bt - toxins . sprayed refuges use conventional insecticides to preserve susceptibility to bt - toxins and utilize two generations of toxins ( bt transgenic plants and conventional foliar insecticides ) simultaneously . 
 unsprayed refuges and , to a lesser degree , embedded refuges , represent a more balanced approach in which transgenics and conventional insecticides each would be capable of managing resistance in the absence of the other . 
 finally , embedded refuges should provide some advantage to a grower by limiting population growth in refuges and limiting yield loss compared to larger refuges . 
 the optimal size for a refuge will be a compromise between grower desires ( narrow refuges and larger yields ) and long term resistance management ( wider refuges and increased yield loss ) . 
 inevitably , however , production of susceptible insects for the management of resistance requires some yield loss . 
 the data presented here suggest that varying the width of refuges embedded within bt - cotton can impact the growth rate of h.virescens populations in those refuges . 
 theoretical work suggests that these changes can significantly impact the rate of resistance evolution to bt - cotton . based on these data as well as data on spatial aspects of female reproductive efforts ( m.a.c . , unpublished data ) , we suggested that refuges in cotton for h. virescens be between 50 and 96 m wide .

 simulation models suggested that source - sink dynamics could interact with the structure of refuges to impact the production of insects in these areas . 
 we tested the hypothesis that altering isolation between refuges and transgenic cotton by manipulating the width of refuges embedded within cotton fields would alter the density of heliothis virescens and helicoverpa zea eggs oviposited in refuges . 
 three categories of refuge widths were tested over two years : they included narrow ( 1624 m wide ) , medium ( 32 - 48 m wide ) and wide ( 8096 m wide ) refuges . 
 isolation between the two habitats increased as refuge width increased . in 1996 
 , eggs of h. virescens from h. zea were not distinguished , but a significant increase in the density of eggs and a significant decrease in relative yield ( refuge yield compared to the yield from immediately surrounding bt - cotton ) was found as refuge width increased . in 1997 , eggs from h. virescens were analyzed separately from h. zea using an elisa test . 
 the density of h. virescens eggs increased with increasing refuge width , and there was a significant decline in density of h. virescens eggs with increasing distance from the refuge . 
 in contrast , there was no impact of refuge width on the density of h. zea eggs , nor was the slope of a regression of egg density and distance from the refuge significantly different from zero . 
 we suggest that these differences reflect differences in the biology of the two insects ."
"sleep can be disturbed by several factors such as illness , stress , and noise . over time 
 these include poor memory , slower reaction time , emotional disturbances , and changes in the immune response ( 1 , 2 ) . 
 however , administration of these drugs is accompanied by side effects including psychomotor impairment , drug dependence , tolerance , amnesia , rebound insomnia , and the potentiating effects of other central depressant drugs ( 3 ) . moreover , some patients with sleep disorders do not respond effectively to current therapeutics . 
 therefore , studies to find new hypnotic agents with fewer side effects and more efficacy have continued . 
 herbal agents have long been a valuable source for developing new therapeutics for disease treatment . 
 ocimum basilicum ( o. basilicum ) is an annual herb belonging to the lamiaceae family and grows mostly in tropical regions such as india , africa , and south asia ( 4 ) . in traditional medicine , 
 o. basilicum is used to treat many disorders such as anxiety , diabetes , cardiovascular diseases , headaches , neurological pain , and seizures ( 5 , 6 ) . 
 it has been demonstrated that the ethyl acetate fraction ( eaf ) of o. basilicum decreases ischemia - induced oxidative stress in the brain and improves short - term memory and motor coordination ( 5 ) . 
 it was reported in some traditional medical texts that o. basilicum leads to sleep and a sedative state . 
 also , some biological activities of o. basilicum were screened by ismail , and it was found that the essential oil of o. basilicum induces anticonvulsant and hypnotic activities ( 7 ) . in folk medicine , maceration is the most widely used form of o. basilicum preparation 
 . however , there is no pharmacological evidence for the sedative - hypnotic effect of o. basilicum macerated extract . 
 the present study was designed to evaluate the sleep - prolonging effects of hydro - alcoholic extract ( hae ) of o. basilicum ) and its fractions .

 a voucher sample was preserved for reference in the herbarium of the department of pharmacognosy , school of pharmacy , mashhad university of medical sciences ( herbarium number : 12937 obl ) . 
 hae was prepared using the maceration method ( 8) . the powder of the leaves of o. basilicum ( 100 g ) was macerated in 800 ml of 70% ethanol for 48 hours . 
 the extract was then filtered through a 0.106 mm filter and dried in a water bath . 
 the yield of the dried extract as related to the weight of the dried leaves was 21% . for the preparation of different fractions from hae , 
 10 g of dried extract were suspended in 200 ml of distilled water and transferred to a separator funnel . using solvent - solvent extraction , 
 the eaf and n - butanol fraction ( nbf ) were separated to obtain water fraction ( wf ) ( 9 , 10 ) .

 first , to determine if hae has a sleep - prolonging effect , the animals received saline ( control group ) and diazepam ( as positive control ) or different doses of hae . in the second experiment , to determine the most effective fraction of hae , animals were treated with wf , eaf , nbf , or 10% dmso ( vehicle for eaf and nbf ) . 
 the hypnotic assessment method was based on the prolongation of sleep induced by pentobarbital . a single dose of hae ( 25 , 50 , 100 mg / kg ) , fractions of hae , diazepam ( 3 mg / kg ) , or other vehicles were injected intraperitoneally ( ip ) into the mice . 
 after 30 minutes , pentobarbital ( 30 mg / kg ip ) was administrated to induce sleep ( 11 - 13 ) . 
 flumazenil ( 1 mg / kg ) was administrated 30 minutes before diazepam or hae ( 12 ) . 
 all materials were injected with a volume of 10 mg / kg ( 11 ) . 
 the onset of sleep is the time that the mice stayed immobile and lost their righting reflex . 
 the time interval between administration of pentobarbital and onset of sleep was considered sleep latency . 
 nine groups , each containing two mice were used for determination of ld50 of hae . 
 groups 1 - 8 were injected ip with 25 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 , 800 , 1,600 , and 3,200 mg / kg of hae and group 9 received normal saline as a vehicle . 
 the highest dose which did not kill any mice and the lowest dose which led to the death of one animal were recorded . 
 the mean of these two doses was considered the median lethal dose ( 14 , 15 ) . 
 the possible cytotoxicity of o. basilicum was tested on rat pheochromocytoma - derived cells ( pc12 ) and murine fibroblast cells ( l929 ) .

 the animals were treated with saline ( control ) and diazepam ( 3 mg / kg ) or hydro - alcoholic extract ( hae ) . * * p < 0.01 vs. control ; * * * p < 0.001 vs. control ; b , mice were treated with 10% dmso ( vehicle ) or 50 mg / kg of water fraction ( wf ) , ethyl acetate fraction ( eaf ) or n - butanol fraction ( nbf ) . * * * p < 0.01 vs. control ; # # # p < 0.01 vs. wf and nbf . 
 values are presented as mean  sem ( n = 8) . among the different fractions of hae , 
 however , nbf significantly decreased the latency time to 4.7  0.3 minutes ( p < 0.001 ) . although wf could decrease sleep latency from the control level ( 6.7  0.4 minutes ) to 5.2  0.2 minutes , this effect was not statistically significant . the highest dose , which did not kill any mice , and the lowest dose , which led to the death of one mouse , were 1.6 and 3.2 g / kg , respectively . 
 the mean of these two doses ( 2.4 g / kg ) was considered as ld50 . 
 the possible cytotoxicity of hae of o. basilicum was evaluated on pc12 and l929 cells ( figure 5 ) . 
 it was found that up to 24 hours none of hae concentrations decreased proliferation of pc12 cells . in the presence of 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 , and 800 g / ml of the extract , cell viability was 100 
 3 , 102  2 , 103  2 , 110  3 , and 113  3% , respectively , as compared to the vehicle ( 100  2.5% ) . 
 regarding l929 cells , the viability was 106  1.5 , 108  2 , 112  2 , 113  1 , and 123  2.5% in the presence of 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 , and 800 mg / ml , respectively . 
 again , there was no significant difference in the cell viability when compared to the vehicle ( 100  2% ) . 
 the cells were cultivated for 24 hours in culture media containing hydro - alcoholic extract of o. basilicum . 
 sleep duration in the negative control group that received normal saline before pentobarbital was 20  2 minutes ( figure 1 ) . 
 as expected , the reference drug diazepam was able to increase the duration of sleep ( 42  4.6 minutes , p < 0.001 vs. control ) . 
 the hae at doses of 25 , 50 , and 100 mg / kg could significantly increase sleep duration to 51  3 minutes ( p < 0.001 ) , 79  3 minutes ( p < 0.001 ) , and 46  5 minutes ( p < 0.001 ) , respectively . 
 the effect produced by 50 mg / kg was significantly greater than that produced by 25 or 100 mg / kg ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the animals were treated with saline ( control ) , diazepam ( 3 mg / kg ) , or hydro - alcoholic extract ( hae ) 30 minutes before administration of pentobarbital ( 30 mg / kg ip ) . * * * p < 0.001 vs. control ; # # # p < 0.001 vs. groups of 25 and 100

 similarly , the effect of hae on sleep duration was significantly inhibited by flumazenil ( 79  3 minutes and 30  2 minutes for hae and hae plus diazepam , respectively , p < 0.001 ) . 
 the animals were treated with saline ( control ) and 3 mg / kg of diazepam or 50 mg / kg of hydro - alcoholic extract ( hae ) before injection of pentobarbital ( 30 mg / kg ip ) . 
 flumazenil ( 1 mg / kg ) was administrated 30 minutes before diazepam or hae . * * * p < 0.001 vs. control ; # # # p < 0.001 vs. hae ;  p 
 values are presented as mean  sem ( n = 8) . as shown in figure 3 , all three fractions of hae exhibited sleep - prolonging activity . 
 duration of sleep in groups receiving 50 mg / kg of wf , eaf , and nbf was 40  4.5 minutes ( p < 0.001 vs. control ) , 30  2 minutes ( p < 0.001 vs. vehicle ) and 42  2 minutes ( p < 0.001 vs. vehicle ) , respectively . among the fractions , nbf induced the maximum prolongation of sleep . 
 the animals were treated with 10% dmso ( vehicle ) or 50 mg / kg of water fraction ( wf ) , ethyl acetate fraction ( eaf ) or n - butanol fraction ( nbf ) before administration of pentobarbital ( 30 mg / kg , ip ) . * * * p < 0.001 vs. control and vehicle ; # p 
 < 0.05 vs. eaf group ; values are presented as mean  sem ( n = 8) . 
 figure 4 shows the time elapsed between the administration of pentobarbital and the onset of sleep . when compared to the control ( 6.7  0.4 minutes ) , diazepam significantly decreased sleep latency to 3.5  0.4 minutes ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the latency time in animals receiving 25 , 50 , and 100 mg / kg of hae was 4.2  0.2 minutes ( p < 0.001 ) , 4.5  0.5 minutes ( p < 0.01 ) , and 4.4  0.4 minutes ( p < 0.01 ) , respectively . 
 the effect of diazepam was not statistically different from that observed with 25 , 50 , or 100 mg / kg of hae . 
 the animals were treated with saline ( control ) and diazepam ( 3 mg / kg ) or hydro - alcoholic extract ( hae ) . * * p < 0.01 vs. control ; * * * p < 0.001 vs. control ; b , mice were treated with 10% dmso ( vehicle ) or 50 mg / kg of water fraction ( wf ) , ethyl acetate fraction ( eaf ) or n - butanol fraction ( nbf ) . * * * p < 0.01 vs. control ; # # # p < 0.01 vs. wf and nbf . 
 values are presented as mean  sem ( n = 8) . among the different fractions of hae , 
 however , nbf significantly decreased the latency time to 4.7  0.3 minutes ( p < 0.001 ) . although wf could decrease sleep latency from the control level ( 6.7  0.4 minutes ) to 5.2  0.2 minutes , this effect was not statistically significant . 
 the highest dose , which did not kill any mice , and the lowest dose , which led to the death of one mouse , were 1.6 and 3.2 g / kg , respectively . 
 the mean of these two doses ( 2.4 g / kg ) was considered as ld50 . 
 the possible cytotoxicity of hae of o. basilicum was evaluated on pc12 and l929 cells ( figure 5 ) . 
 it was found that up to 24 hours none of hae concentrations decreased proliferation of pc12 cells . in the presence of 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 , and 800 g / ml of the extract , 
 cell viability was 100  3 , 102  2 , 103  2 , 110  3 , and 113  3% , respectively , as compared to the vehicle ( 100  2.5% ) . 
 regarding l929 cells , the viability was 106  1.5 , 108  2 , 112  2 , 113  1 , and 123  2.5% in the presence of 50 , 100 , 200 , 400 , and 800 mg / ml , respectively . 
 again , there was no significant difference in the cell viability when compared to the vehicle ( 100  2% ) . 
 the cells were cultivated for 24 hours in culture media containing hydro - alcoholic extract of o. basilicum . 
 the present study showed that o. basilicum further enhances sleep behavior , confirming that this plant has a hypnotic action as claimed in traditional medicine . to our knowledge , this is the first pharmacological study showing the effects of the macerated extract of this plant on sleep duration and sleep latency . also , this is the first work to determine the ld50 value for hae of o. basilicum and to assess possible cytotoxicity of this extract on neuronal cells . 
 yet , results of this study are preliminary and need to be confirmed by further clinical trials . 
 the hypnotic assessment method was based on prolongation of sleep induced by pentobarbital , which is the most commonly used method for screening sedative - hypnotic agents ( 11 - 13 ) . in agreement with the previously published works and as expected , diazepam significantly increased pentobarbital - induced sleeping time , indicating that our study method was optimized ( 17 , 18 ) . 
 the effect of hae of o. basilicum on sleep latency was lower than that of diazepam . 
 however , the sleep - prolonging effect of hae was comparable to that of diazepam , and , even at a dose of 50 mg / kg , hae had a greater effect . also , the hypnotic effect of hae of o. basilicum is greater when compared with the effect of essential oil of o. basilicum reported by ismail ( 4-fold and 2-fold increase in sleep duration , respectively ) ( 7 ) . according to our results , the hypnotic effect of hae was not dose - dependent in the range of given doses , and the maximum effect occurred with a dose of 50 mg / kg . 
 therefore , we used this dose to investigate the effects of different fractions of hae . the fractions of hae were prepared to obtain better insight into the nature of compounds responsible for the hypnotic effect of o. basilicum : 1 , wf which extracts water - soluble constituents ( e.g. , glycosides , quaternary alkaloids , tannins ) ; 2 , eaf which extracts compounds of intermediate polarity ( e.g. , some flavonoids ) ; and 3 , nbf which extracts low polar agents ( e.g. , sterols , alkanes , and some terpenoids ) ( 19 , 20 ) . 
 although wf , eaf , and nbf at a dose of 50 mg / kg were all able to increase sleep duration , not one of them could enhance sleep duration to the level induced by 50 mg / kg of hae . 
 because hae contains the active constituents of all the above - mentioned fractions , it can be concluded that an additive effect was caused by the interaction between these constituents when hae was administrated . 
 therefore , both polar and non - polar constituents in o. basilicum extract are involved in the sleep - prolonging effect of this plant . among wf , 
 eaf , and nbf fractions , nbf not only induced the maximum prolongation of sleep duration , but also was the only fraction to induce a significant decrease in sleep latency . on the other hand 
 therefore , nbf contains a higher concentration of constituents responsible for the hypnotic effect of o. basilicum . 
 these include terpenoids ( e.g. , linalool , eugenol ) , flavonoids ( e.g. , quercetrin , luteolin ) , alkaloids ( e.g. , rosmarinic acid ) , steroids ( e.g. , beta - sitisterol ) , and saponins ( 21 , 22 ) . 
 it has been shown that o. basilicum contains high amounts of linalool , eugenol , and rosmarinic acid ( 7 ) . 
 linck and coworkers demonstrated that linalool increases barbiturate - induced sleeping time in mice ( 23 ) . 
 similarly , the sleep - prolonging effect of eugenol was reported by sharma et al . 
 rosmarinic acid is found in methanolic extract of o. basilicum and can be isolated from the nbf of plant extracts ( 24 , 25 ) . 
 it plays a major role in the sedative - hypnotic actions of some medicinal plants ( 26 ) . 
 neurons located in the anterior hypothalamus release gamma - aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) to inhibit wake - promoting areas in the hypothalamus and brainstem ( 27 , 28 ) . 
 barbiturates such as pentobarbital act on the gaba receptor s ionophore complex and favor the binding of gaba . 
 benzodiazepines such as diazepam increase the affinity of gaba for its receptor and thereby enhance pentobarbital - induced sleeping time ( 29 ) . 
 consistent with this , we observed that pretreatment of mice with flumazenil decreases the sleep - prolonging effect of diazepam . 
 in agreement with our finding , awad et al . reported that rosmarinic acid , which is found in the extract of o. basilicum , can act as a gaba transaminase inhibitor and therefore increases the brain level of gaba ( 30 ) . therefore , it is rational to suggest that the sleep - prolonging effect of o. basilicum is mediated , at least in part , through the potentiating of the gabaergic system . 
 it is now accepted that some natural compounds interact with the gabaergic system to increase sleep behavior ( 31 , 32 ) . 
 the toxicity assay showed that the ld50 value for hae of o. basilicum is 2.4 g / kg . 
 this dose is far from its hypnotic doses ( 25 - 100 mg / kg ) . 
 also , hae , even at high concentrations , did not decrease the viability of neuronal and fibroblast cells . 
 therefore , it seems that the hypnotic effect of o. basilicum is not accompanied by neurotoxicity . in conclusion 
 , present data demonstrated that the macerated extract of o. basilicum potentiates sleeping behaviors without any cytotoxicity .","flumazenil mg kg administrated minutes diazepam hae

 all the test compounds were injected intraperitoneally ( ip ) 30 minutes before pentobarbital administration ( 30 mg / kg ) . duration and latency of pentobarbital - induced sleep were recorded . 
 also , ld50 of hae was determined and the cytotoxicity of hae was tested on neural and fibroblast cells using the mtt assay.resultshae increased the duration of pentobarbital - induced sleep at doses of 25 , 50 , and 100 mg / kg ( p < 0.001 ) . the hypnotic effect of hae was comparable to that induced by diazepam . similarly , wf , eaf , and nbf at 50 mg / kg could increase sleep duration . 
 the sleep latency was decreased by hae ( p < 0.01 - p < 0.001 ) and nbf ( p 
 < 0.001 ) , but not by wf and eaf . the ld50 value for hae was found to be 2.4 g / kg . 
 hae had no effect on the viability of neuronal pc12 cells and l929 fibroblast cells.conclusionsthe present data demonstrated that ocimum basilicum potentiates sleeping behaviors without any cytotoxicity . 
 the main component ( s ) responsible for the hypnotic effects of this plant is most likely a non - polar agent ( s ) which is found in nbf .

"succinic acid is a member of the four - carbon dicarboxylic acid family in tricarboxylic acid cycle ( tca ) and has a wide range of applications in the fields of surfactants , green solvents , and pharmaceutical intermediates as an important four - carbon intermediate compound . 
 succinic acid is classified as the most promising chemical among 12 biobased chemicals by the u.s . 
 succinic acid has been conventionally produced from fossil raw materials for more than a century , which can lead to high cost , feedstock exhaustion , and environment pollution [ 3 , 4 ] . 
 recent studies suggest that the production of succinic acid by microbe fermentation has the potential to solve the aforementioned problems . as the endproduct of energy metabolism 
 , succinic acid can be produced by many anaerobic microbes , such as actinobacillus succinogenes , anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens , mannheimia succiniciproducens , and escherichia coli especially a. succinogenes atcc 55618 , which is a facultative anaerobe isolated from the bovine rumen . 
 it could produce higher concentration succinic acid as a major endproduct than other strains without gene reconstruction and glucose feeding . however , to obtain a high production of succinic acid ( i.e. , more than 45 
 g  l ) , the fermentation medium compositions were often complicated with the addition of high concentration of glucose and ten kinds of slight vitamins [ 810 ] . according to the aforementioned reports , about twenty kinds of components were added into the fermentation medium for the succinic acid production , which led to high cost and complex operation . 
 it must be paid attention that the complicated medium is not the assurance of high production of succinic acid [ 1113 ] . 
 so the optimization of fermentation medium of a. succinogenes atcc 55618 is essential . since nine components existed in the fermentation medium ( i.e. , glucose , yeast extract ( ye ) , corn steep liquor ( csl ) , kh2po4 , k2hpo4 , nacl , mgcl2 , cacl2 , and mgco3 ) , a great number of experiments should be simultaneously run , and the possible interactions between these components were also needed to be studied . for fermentation medium optimization , plackett - burman design ( pbd ) was a good choice in rapid screening multifactors to find the most significant independent factors 
 . moreover , to optimize the concentration of the important factors , statistical methods have been done by using response surface methodology ( rsm ) , in which several factors were simultaneously varied . compared with the one - factor - at - a - time method 
 , statistical experimental design has the advantages of reducing experiment numbers and improving statistical interaction analysis [ 1618 ] . for the reasons above 
 , we proposed the optimization method including the following steps : ( 1 ) using a two - level pbd to identify the key medium components and their experimental levels for further optimization , ( 2 ) applying the path of steepest ascent ( sa ) to move rapidly towards the neighborhood of the optimum response , and ( 3 ) employing a box - behnken design ( bbd ) to develop mathematical models to estimate the relationships between the response ( i.e. , the succinic acid production ) and the key components . 
 the strain of a. succinogenes atcc 55618 , purchased from american type culture collection ( atcc ) , was maintained in 20% glycerol at 70c . 
 the plate was inoculated with the strain maintained at 70c and incubated at 37c for 2 days . 
 preculture medium consisted of the following components ( g  l ) : tryptone 17 ; soya peptone 3 ; glucose 2.5 ; nacl 5 ; k2hpo4 2.5 . 
 for the first preculture , 50  ml of medium was prepared in a 250-ml anaerobic bottle , and a colony from a plate culture was inoculated , and then incubated for 12 hours at 37c on a rotary shaker at 120  rpm . for the second preculture , 47.5  ml of medium was prepared in a 250-ml anaerobic bottle , inoculated with 2.5  ml of the first preculture broth , and incubated for 12 hours at 37c on a rotary shaker at 120  rpm . 
 g  l ) : glucose 107 ; yeast extract ( ye ) 16 ; corn steep liquor ( csl ) 12 ; kh2po4 3 ; k2hpo4 1.5 ; nacl 1 ; mgcl2 0.3 ; cacl2 0.3 ; mgco3 40 . 
 the fermentation medium was inoculated with 2.5  ml of the second preculture broth in 47.5  ml of medium in a 250-ml anaerobic bottle with co2 as the gas phase . 
 . the dynamic profile of the succinic acid biosynthesis of a. succinogenes was monitored during the submerged fermentation process . 
 each data point was expressed by an average with an error bar ( i.e. , standard error from three independent samples ) . 
 the purpose of plackett - burman design ( pbd ) was to identify the key medium components for the succinic acid production . 
 two dummy variables , whose levels did not change in the design , were introduced to estimate the population standard error . 
 the first order was used to fit data from pbd as follows : 
 ( 1)y=0+ixi , 
 where y is the predicted response , 0 and i are constant coefficients , and xi is the coded independent factors . 
 first , the effect of all variables , including dummies , was calculated as follows : 
 ( 2)evi=rvi(+)rvi()n/2 , 
 where evi is the effect of variable i ; rvi(+ ) and rvi( ) represent the response parameter ( i.e. , the succinic acid production ) of an assembly in the screening design which contains the high and low levels of variable i , respectively ; n is the number of assemblies ( in this study , n = 12 ) . after determining the effect of each variable , the standard deviation ( sd ) of dummies , which serves as the population standard deviation in the student 's t - test 
 as follows was calculated : 
 ( 3)sd=(ed)2n , 
 where ed is the effect of dummy variables ; n is the number of dummy variables ( in this study , n = 2 ) . 
 finally , a student 's t - test was performed to identify the significant t factors as follows : 
 ( 4)tvi = evisd . 
 the larger the absolute value of the t - value , the variable is more significant . 
 the method of steepest ascent ( sa ) design was used to move rapidly towards the neighborhood of the optimum response . 
 the experiments were adopted to determine a suitable direction by increasing or decreasing the concentrations of variables according to the results of pbd . a 15-run box - behnken design ( bbd ) with three center points was employed in this work , and the maximal values of the productions of succinic acid were shown in table 3 . to describe the relationships between the succinic acid production and the medium components , 
 a mathematical model was developed by the following second - order polynomial equation to fit data in rsm of bbd : 
 ( 5)y=0+ixi+iixi2+i=1nijxixj+  ij ;  i , j=1,2,3  , 
 where y is the predicted response , 0 is the offset term , i is the linear effect , ii is the quadratic effect , ij is the interaction effect , and  is an experimental error . and 
 xi and xj represent the independent variables ( medium components ) in the form of coded values as follows : 
 ( 6)xi = xixxi  i=1,2,3 , 
 where xi and xi are the dimensionless and the actual values of independent variable i , x is the actual value of the independent variable i at the central point , and xi is the step change of xi corresponding to a unit variation of the dimensionless value . 
 the model of response was expression in terms of code variables and without the statistically insignificant terms ( different models are available in bbd of statistical software package minitab 15 , minitab inc . , state college , pa 16801 - 3008 , usa ) . 
 standardized pareto charts , representing the estimated effects of parameters and parameter interactions on responses , permitted us to check the statistical significance of the pbd . 
 the student 's t - test permitted to check the statistical significance of the regression coefficients . 
 the analysis of variable ( anova ) was performed on experimental data to evaluate the statistical significance of the model . 
 the models of each response were expressed in terms of code / uncoded variables and without the statistically insignificant terms . 
 a p value less than 5% indicates that model terms are significant , while less than 1% indicates that model terms are highly significant . 
 a p value is a measure of how much evidence one has against the null hypothesis ( the null hypothesis of the test read like this : h0 : 1 = 2 =  = i = 0 ; h1 : at least one  is not zero ) and evidence against null hypothesis is more for smaller p value . 
 a p value of 0.05 or less rejects the null hypothesis at the 5% level , that is , only 5% of the probability the supposed statistical model will fail to predict the response . 
 the model adequacies were checked by the determination coefficients ( r ) , adjusted r , and predicted r. the determination coefficient ( r ) is a measure of how well the regression equation fits the sample data . 
 while r can be made larger simply by adding more predictor variables to the model , an adjusted r has been proposed . 
 adjusted r is a modification of r that adjusts for the number of explanatory terms in a model . 
 a predicted r is used to measure the amount of variation in new data ( i.e. , other levels among the tested maximal value and minimal value of the factor ) explained by the model . 
 it is calculated by systematically removing each observation from the data set , estimating the regression equation , and determining how well the model predicts the removed observation . predicted r is used in regression analysis to indicate 
 how well the model predicts responses for new observations , whereas r indicates how well the model fits the data . 
 predicted r can prevent overfitting the model and can be more useful than adjusted r for comparing models because it is calculated using observations not included in model estimation . predicted r larger values of predicted r squared suggest models of greater predictive ability 
 the  minitab 15 ( minitab inc . , state college , pa 16801 - 3008 , usa ) 
 software was employed for the regression analysis and the graphical optimization , respectively . for sampling 
 , three flasks were taken each time , and cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 660  nm ( od660 ) . at an od660 of 1.0 , a. succinogenes 
 atcc 55618 has a concentration of 0.626  g dry cell weight ( dcw )  l. for succinic acid determination , 1  ml of methanol and 1  ml of acetonitrile were added to 1  ml of fermentation broth to remove proteins , and the sample was kept at 4c overnight . 
 after centrifugation at 11,000  rpm for 30  min , the supernatants were diluted and filtrated through a 0.22-m filter and analyzed by high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc , waters ) using an agela venusil asb c18 column . 
 the optimized mobile phase was 50  mm kh2po4 water solution , with the ph adjusted to 3.5 by h3po4 . 
 the column oven temperature was maintained at 40c , and the flow rate was 1  ml min . 
 the methodology of plackett - burman design ( pbd ) is a powerful and useful tool in rapidly searching key factors from a multivariable system . 
 pbd does not determine the exact quantity , but it can provide some important information about each factor by relatively few experiments . as shown in table 1 , pbd for 12 trials with two levels of concentrations was undertaken to evaluate the significances of nine medium components . in order to determine the influence of the most important parameters , 
 analysis of the measured response variables enabled to obtain standardized pareto charts and response surface plots . a standardized pareto chart 
 consists of bars with a length proportional to the absolute value of the estimated effects , divided by the standard error . 
 the bars are displayed in order of the size of the effects , with the largest effects on top . 
 the chart includes a vertical line at the critical t - value for an alpha . 
 some investigations find that the confidence levels greater than 80% ( p < 0.2 ) are acceptable . in this study , 
 the chart includes a vertical line at the critical t - value for  of 0.20 . 
 effects for which the bars are smaller than the critical t - value are considered as not significant and not affecting the response variables . 
 effects may be positive or negative .   as shown in figure 1 , for the succinic acid production , the variables glucose , yeast extract , and mgco3 had a confidence level above 80% . 
 hence , these were considered to be significant for the succinic acid biosynthesis . analyzed by minitab , a first - order model , was fitted to the results obtained from the twelve experiments as the equation : 
 ( 7)y(g  l1)=39.09 + 4.18cglucose2.28cye1.84ccsl0.83ck2hpo41.93ckh2po41.24cnacl+1.53cmgcl2 + 1.36ccacl2 + 3.26cmgco3 . 
 where y is the succinic acid production , and cglucose , cye , ccsl , ck2hpo4 , ckh2po4 , cnacl , cmgcl2 , ccacl2 , and cmgco3 are the value of glucose , ye , csl , k2hpo4 , kh2po4 , nacl , mgcl2 , cacl2 , and mgco3 , respectively . 
 the goodness of the regression was checked by the coefficient of determination r whose value ( r = 95.39% ) indicates that only 4.61% of the total variation could not be explained by the model , and it was reasonable to use the regression model to analyze the trend in the response . 
 and then , glucose , yeast extract , and mgco3 were selected for further optimization to obtain a maximum response . 
 according to the coefficients of the glucose ( 4.18 ) , yeast extract ( 2.28 ) and mgco3 ( 3.26 ) , the positive coefficients indicated that the high level of glucose and mgco3 concentration in pbd was benefit for the succinic acid production . on the contrary 
 , the negative coefficient indicated that the low level of yeast extract concentration was helpful for the succinic acid accumulation . a maximum succinic acid production of 51.9  g  l was obtained with 80.0  g  l of glucose , 60.0  g  l of mgco3 , and 10.0  g  l of yeast extract . 
 the corresponding productivity and specific productivity were 1.1  g  l  h and 13.4  g succinic acid g dcw . 
 however , the od660 of 6.2 obtained with this medium was not the highest among the 12 conditions .   according to the metabolic pathway of a. succinogenes , 
 succinic acid was an end - product from the substrate of glucose , which implied that succinic acid formation was decided by the supplement of glucose directly . 
 the yield of succinic acid against glucose was improved by the increase of initial glucose concentration , and it would reach the peak value when the initial glucose concentration was 70.0 
 the culture ph value is one of the key factors in the production of succinic acid . 
 mgco3 was used as a neutralizing agent and added to the fermentation broth to adjust culture ph . before optimization , the ph value decreased from 7.5 to 5.7 during the fermentation . 
 compared with the ph value of basic medium , the initial ph increased up to 8.0 and was followed by slow decline after the optimization . 
 the final ph value of optimal medium with an initial ph of 7.5 was more close to neutral ( about 6.5 ) during the fermentation , and neutral environment was helpful to accumulate succinic acid . in our previous results , the highest succinic acid production of 48.2 
 the pattern of succinic acid production at a culture ph of 7.0 was similar with that obtained at 7.5 . 
 when the initial culture ph was adjusted to 6.5 or 8.0 , a significant decrease of succinic acid production was observed . 
 so , the effect of medium optimization mgco3 may be partly from the influence of the ph . 
 on the other hand , sufficient co2 supplement in the fermentation broth could strongly influence the metabolic flux of carbon and the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate ( pep ) carboxykinase , which were the important committed steps for the biosynthesis of succinic acid [ 24 , 26 ] ; therefore , sufficient co2 is another key factor influencing succinic acid accumulation . 
 however , in our previous work , there was no significant effect of co2 partial pressure on the production of succinic acid when gaseous co2 was used as the sole co2 donor . 
 as an important co2 donor in the a. succinogenes fermentation , mgco3 could react with organic acids in fermentation broth and caused an increase in the dissolved concentrations of hco3 , co3 , and co2 . 
 when gaseous co2 was used with mgco3 , higher amount of mgco3 was more effective on promoting the succinic acid synthesis . and the maximum succinic acid production of 61.92 
 g  l was obtained at 159.22  mm dissolved co2 concentration , which was supplied by 40  g  l mgco3 with 100% co2 gas . 
 this means that the dissolved co2 concentration was another factor affecting succinic acid synthesis . and 
 during the fermentation process , insoluble mgco3 caused turbid broth , which made the cells spread uniformly in the broth . 
 all these properties make mgco3 to be one of the key factors significantly improved the succinic acid production .   at last , 
 yeast extract was also screened to be a key factor because it affected cell growth directly as the nutrient . 
 it contains many trace substances , such as folic acid , pantothenic acid , biotin , and vitamin b1 , b2 , b6 , and b12 . 
 this may be the important reason why many kinds of vitamins could be omitted meanwhile the succinic acid could efficiently be accumulated in this work . 
 to conclude , the variables of glucose , mgco3 , and yeast extract had a confidence level above 80% and hence were considered to significantly influence the succinic acid production . 
 the optimal concentrations of these three key components needed to be further studied as follows . based on the results above , glucose , 
 yeast extract , and mgco3 were the three key factors , and the high level of glucose ( i.e. , 80.0  g  l ) and mgco3 ( i.e. , 60.0  g  l ) , while the low level of yeast extract ( i.e. , 10.0 
 g  l ) was benefit for the succinic acid production of a. succinogenes atcc 55618 . 
 thus , the path of sa was moved along the path in which glucose and mgco3 increased , while yeast extract decreased ( table 2 ) . the highest succinic acid production of 48.4  1.3  g  l and od660 of 6.1 was observed under the point of levels , namely , 80.0  g  l of glucose , 
 10.0  g  l of yeast extract , and 60.0  g  l of mgco3 . 
 the corresponding productivity and specific productivity were 1.0  g  l  h and 12.4  g succinic acid g dcw . 
 this result suggested that the point was near the optimal point and was chosen for further optimization . 
 as shown in table 2 , the succinic acid production did not further increase with the increase concentrations of glucose and mgco3 and the decrease concentration of yeast extract . for glucose , although a. succinogenes could tolerate glucose concentration as high as 150.0 
 g  l , the yield of succinic acid would decrease when glucose concentration exceeds 70.0  g  l [ 9 , 23 ] . 
 g  l , the concentrations of succinic acid could not be further improved . for mgco3 , the culture ph of fermentation broth was increased with the increase of mgco3 concentration ( data not shown ) , which may make the cells more difficult to adapt . 
 , it was observed that the absence of yeast extract led to almost no succinic acid accumulation , which indicated that this component was the basic nutrient for the cell growth . 
 to conclude , the highest succinic acid production was obtained under the condition of 80.0 
 g  l of mgco3 , which suggested that this point was near the optimal point .   based on the information above , 
 taking the point ( 80.0  g  l of glucose , 10.0  g  l of yeast extract and 60.0  g  l of mgco3 ) as the central level of bbd , then the three - factors , three - level bbd was employed ( table 3 ) . 
 the lack of fit ( lof ) is the variation of the data around the fitted model . 
 lof is a model fit test that is used to check how well a model fits the data and help to remove insignificant terms from the model . 
 a p - value of lof 0.614 indicted that the model fits the response well . 
 the  predicted r  of 0.9696 was in reasonable agreement with the  adjusted r  of 0.9911 , and it might be also said that the model determination coefficient ( r of 0.9968 ) was reasonable agreement with the experimental results , indicating that 99.68% of the variability could be revealed by the model . 
 the polynomial model for the succinic acid production was expressed by ( 8) ( in coded value ) and ( 9 ) ( in uncoded value ) ( table 5 ) consider the following : 
 ( 8)y=49.563 + 1.274a+5.495b+2.346c+1.008ab+0.310ac+2.373bc2.562a24.084b24.972c2(9)y=285.728 + 3.842cglucose0.092cye+5.482cmgco3 + 0.020cglucosecye+0.0031cglucosecmgco3 + 0.047cyecmgco30.026cglucose20.163cye20.050cmgco32 . 
 the model reveals that glucose concentration ( a ) , yeast extract concentration ( b ) , and mgco3 concentration ( c ) had a significant effect ( p < 0.0001 ) on the succinic acid production ( y ) . 
 positive coefficient of a , b , and c indicated a linear effect to increase . 
 the graphs ( figure 2 ) depict the changes in the parameter modeled as the two factors move along those levels , while the other factor held constant at the central point . according to ( 9 ) 
 , the highest succinic acid production of 52.3  g  l was obtained at 14.0  g  l of yeast extract and 64.3  g  l of mgco3 , while glucose concentration was held at 80.0 
 g  l ; the maximal succinic acid production of 50.0  g  l could be observed at 82.6  g  l of glucose and 62.4  g  l of mgco3 , while holding 10.0  g  l of yeast extract ; under the conditions of 83.9  g  l of glucose , 
 13.6  g  l of yeast extract and 60.0  g  l of mgco3 ( the factor held constant ) , the succinic acid production could reach its peak value of 51.8  g  l. according to ( 8) and ( 9 ) , it was predicted that a maximum succinic acid production of 53.0  g  l was appeared at 84.6  g  l of glucose , 
 14.5  g  l of yeast extract , and 64.7  g  l of mgco3 . in a word , 
 the best level combination of the three key factors ( i.e. , glucose , yeast extract , and mgco3 ) was predicted by the polynomial model from bbd . 
 then the reliability of the model and the accuracy of the prediction should be checked by verification experiment . the availability of the regression model of the succinic acid production using the calculated optimal medium compositions , namely , 84.6  g  l glucose , 14.5 
 g  l yeast extract , and 64.7  g  l mgco3 , was validated with triplicate experiments . 
 the mean maximal value of succinic acid production was 52.7  0.8  g  l , which agreed with the predicted value ( 53.0 
 the model was considered to be accurate and reliable for predicting the succinic acid production by a. succinogenes . 
 theoretically , 1.71  mol succinate can be produced per mol glucose ( plus co2 ) , based on the available electrons ( i.e. , 24 electrons in glucose divided by 14 electrons in succinate = 1.71 ) . in this work , compared with that of basic medium ( 0.45  mol  mol glucose ) , the yield of succinic acid against glucose was enhanced by 111.1% in optimized medium ( 0.95  mol  mol glucose ) . 
 this may be because there are some factors other than the medium , which affect the yield of succinic acid but are not investigated in this study . 
 other authors have reported that the succinic acid production reached 84  g  l in the fermentation of actinobacillus succinogenes nj113 , in which the medium was with similar components to the basic medium in this work , and the corresponding yield of succinic acid was 1.20  mol  mol glucose . 
 since nj113 is the strain screened by jiang et al , this strain may have greater ability to synthesize succinic acid . 
 to conclude , the best level combination of the three key factors ( i.e. , 84.6  g  l glucose , 14.5  g  l yeast extract , and 64.7  g  l mgco3 ) was obtained by using the statistical experimental design . 
 0.8  g  l under the optimal medium compositions , which agreed with the predicted value ( 53.0 
 g  l ) well and was 67.3% higher than that obtained with the basic medium ( i.e. , 31.5  2.3 
 in this study , a highly efficient optimization method by combining plackett - burman design , steepest ascent , and box - behnken design was developed . this method was demonstrated to be effective in selecting the significant factors and enhancing succinic acid production in a. succinogenes atcc 55618 fermentation . 
 glucose , yeast extract , and mgco3 were screened to be key factors for the succinic acid production . a maximal succinic acid production of 52.7  0.8  g  l was obtained with 84.6  g  l glucose , 14.5  g  l yeast extract , and 64.7  g  l mgco3 . 
 this result agreed with the predicted value well and was 67.3% higher than that obtained with the basic medium .","succinic acid production key components

 most of the studies recruited participants either through convenience sampling ( 25 studies ) ( 2426,3032,36,37,39,51,52,59,65 , 67,69,73,74,7678,84,8890,9395,97,99 ) or by consecutive sampling ( 32 studies ) ( 18,19,21,27,3335,40,41,4548,55,57,58,6064,66,68,71,75,79,80,82,85,86,91,92,96,98,100 ) techniques . 
 three studies used other sampling methods ( 29,38,54 ) , and in 13 studies the method used for recruitment was not clear or not reported ( 20,22,23,4244,49,50,53,56,70,72,81,83,87 ) . 
 however , 11 ( 15% ) of 73 studies failed to report clear and explicit inclusion and recruitment procedures criteria ( 20,2224,42,44,53,57,65,67,77,89,90 ) . 
 sample sizes ranged from 10 ( 36 ) to 12 480 ( 54 ) participants . 
 , patients underwent geriatric assessment during admission or stay at inpatient ward ( 21,38,41,60,61,63,65,68,69,79,82,86,92 ) , and participants in 11 studies were evaluated during initial or routine clinic visits ( 33,34,4648,56,62,64,74,77,88 ) . in four studies , the geriatric assessment took place either at inpatient admission or in the outpatient clinic ( 57,72,9395 ) . 
 table 1 presents an overview of the domains included in geriatric assessments , and supplementary table 3 ( available online ) presents the detailed content and domains of the geriatric assessment used in each study . 
 of the 73 studies , 68 included measures of basic activities of daily living ( 1841,41,42,4451,5363,6567,6972,7483,85100 ) , and 65 included instrumental activities of daily living ( 1828,3039,41,4463,6572,7495,9799 ) .

 articles reporting on the same study . a total of 58 studies included a comorbidity domain ( 1825,2732,34,35,3848,50,51,54,55,57,5961,63,6568 , 7177,79,80,82,8487,8991,93100 ) . 
 assessment of depression , anxiety , or general mood was a component of geriatric assessment in 52 studies ( 1923 , 2633,36,39,42,44,4750,52,53,57,58,6067,69,7177,7985 , 8795,97,98 ) . 
 a nutritional assessment was conducted in 40 studies ( 1820 , 25,2729,3236,38,39,43,45,47,48,50,51,53,5557,63,65,66,71 , 7476,79,82,84,8790,9297,99,100 ) , and 27 studies assessed the risk of falls ( 19,25,27,38,42,43,45,47,48,50,52,54,58,61,63,66 ,  72,7678,80,82,84,8896,98,99 ) . 
 performance status was assessed in 37 studies ( 20,21,24,3032,34,35,39,41,44 , 4648 ,  50,51,53,55,56,6071,74,75,8690,9398,100 ) . 
 information about the use of prescription medications was collected from patients in 22 studies ( 19,25,28,29,39,47,48,5052,55,56,63,66,71,72,75,78,82,84,85,92,98,99 ) , and in 14 of these 22 studies , the information obtained included the total number of prescriptions ( 25,29,39,47,48,51,52,63,66 ,  71,75,78,82,84,85,92 ) . in 24 studies ( 19,22,23,25,28,38,48,5052,55,56,63,65,66,72,73,78,8486,8890,93,97,98 ) , geriatric assessment included the availability of social support and living arrangements , such as the availability of a caregiver . 
 the most commonly used objective measure of physical function was gait speed , which was included in 15 studies ( 25,29,43,45,50,52,61,64,65,72,78,84,87,88,9395 ) . 
 patient characteristics that were less often incorporated into geriatric assessments included symptoms [ assessed using a symptom inventory , two studies ( 22,23,85 ) ; fatigue or energy levels , seven studies ( 21,25,37,43,60,85,9395 ) ; pain , three studies ( 37,66,85 ) ; quality of life , seven studies ( 22,23,31,32,37,50,65,68,74 ) ; grip strength , five studies ( 43,64,87,9395 ) ; distress , three studies ( 66,85,89,90 ) ; and self - rated health , two studies ( 54,73 ) ] . in 30 of 73 studies , the results of geriatric assessment were summarized in a summary score ( 18,20,24,26,34,40,42,43,47,4951,54,55,66,70,7276,78,79,84,9396,98,99 ) . in 12 of those studies ( 20,24,40,47,50,54,75,79,84,96,98,99 ) , the summary score used was the classification of fit , vulnerable , and frail developed by balducci and stanta ( 101 ) . in this classification 
 , frail refers to patients who are generally unfit for cancer treatment ( defined as those with any of the following characteristics : older than 85 years , more than two disabilities , multiple comorbidities , or the presence of geriatric syndromes ) and should receive best supportive care or palliative treatment ; fit ( defined as patients who are independent and have no clinically significant comorbid conditions ) indicates patients who should receive standard therapy ; and vulnerable ( defined as patients with one or two clinically significant comorbid conditions and/or instrumental activities of daily living disability but no activities of daily living disability ) refers to patients for which the standard treatment should be adjusted . 
 thirty studies reported some aspect of the feasibility of the geriatric assessment , such as time needed to complete the assessment and/or who ( study author , patient themselves , or others ) conducted the assessment ( 21,25,26,32,36,37,40,45,46,50,52,5558,60,66,69,7375,77,78,84,85,8789,93,94,99 ) . in most of these studies , the assessment was done through a face - to - face interview and generally took 1045 minutes . among studies that reported how many participants refused the assessment ( 26,74,78,94,95 ) , 
 only a small number of participants refused the assessments ( table 2 ) . in six studies ( 33,66,69,85,88,89 ) , 
 however , only four of those studies ( 66,85,88,89 ) reported on feasibility , and each showed that it was acceptable ( more than 75% of participants could complete the survey without assistance , and participants were satisfied with length of questionnaires and content ) . 
 eleven studies ( 19,37,46,49,51,55,57,65,78,81,83,99 ) reported psychometric properties or diagnostic accuracy of the geriatric assessment ( ie , validity , reliability , and/or sensitivity and specificity ) ( table 3 ) . 
 most of these studies examined diagnostic accuracy of one or more short geriatric assessment tools with those of a full geriatric assessment . 
 however , because these studies compared different screening instruments with different forms of full geriatric assessment or used the same instruments but with different cutoffs , it was not possible to summarize the results in a quantitative manner 
 first , shorter forms of geriatric assessment generally had good diagnostic accuracy compared with a full geriatric assessment . 
 for example , aparicio et al . ( 19 ) found that concordance between individual domain scores from mini - geriatric assessment and from comprehensive geriatric assessment ranged from 66% to 83% . 
 second , four studies that compared the vulnerable elder survey-13 items ( ves-13 ) with a full geriatric assessment found that the former had excellent diagnostic accuracy , with an area under the curve that ranged from 0.83 to 0.90 , sensitivity that ranged from 54% to 87% , and specificity that ranged from 70% to 89% ( 49,51,55,78 ) . 
 in addition , one study ( 49 ) compared the groningen frailty indicator to a full geriatric assessment ; one study ( 55 ) compared the barber questionnaire to a full geriatric assessment ; and one study ( 99 ) compared expert physician judgment to the balducci classification . 
 thirty - seven studies ( 51% ) examined at least one of the four a priori specified outcomes presented below . 
 the outcomes use of geriatric assessment ( followed by interventions ) to avoid complications of treatment and health and functional status were not studied in the included studies . 
 below , the results for each of the studied outcomes are described . 
 geriatric assessment and treatment decision . 
 an important goal of geriatric assessment is to distinguish between older patients who are fit to undergo standard cancer treatments and frail older patients who would benefit from modified treatment or best supportive care . 
 only four studies ( 19,27,48,98 ) , all conducted in france , examined the impact of geriatric assessment before the start of treatment on the cancer treatment plan ( table 4 ) . in two studies ( 19,98 ) , 
 geriatric assessment did not influence the treatment decision , whereas in the other two studies ( 27,48 ) , geriatric assessment led to changes in the treatment plan for 40%50% of patients , mostly consisting of changes in the chemotherapy regimen . of note 
 ( 48 ) , the final treatment decision ( which took into account the results of the geriatric assessment ) was made by a doctor or team that was not the original doctor or team that conducted the geriatric assessment . in the study of chaibi et al . 
 ( 27 ) , patients were rediscussed at tumor board , where the multidisciplinary team decided to change their treatment recommendation based on the results of the geriatric assessment .

 ( 74 ) reported that assessment and interventions influenced the oncological treatment , but it was not clear how or how often they influenced the outcome . 
 the impact of geriatric assessment on the treatment decision was examined by marenco et al . 
 ( 34 ) in a prospective study with a variety of cancers and stages ( n = 571 ) , and by to et al . 
 ( 66 ) in a cross - sectional study with diverse cancers and stages ( n = 200 ) . however , it is not clear how treatment decisions were specifically impacted ( eg , increase in treatment dose or dose reduction was not reported ) in these two studies . 
 three studies ( 27,74,84 ) have shown that geriatric assessment led to geriatric interventions , such as nutritional interventions and treatment of depression before the start of treatment . 
 geriatric assessment and complications or toxicity of treatment . 
 table 5 lists all studies that examined complications or toxicity of treatment as an outcome of geriatric assessment . 
 nine studies ( 21,3033,35,71,73,75,95,100 ) that examined the impact of geriatric assessment on complications of any type of cancer treatment did not use multivariable analysis techniques . 
 complications were generally defined as grade 3 or 4 treatment - related toxicity , treatment interruptions , and postoperative complications , such as wound infections . in five studies with mixed cancer diagnoses and stages and sample sizes that ranged from 60 to 660 participants ( 21,33,35,71,75,100 ) , impairments in basic and instrument activities of daily living , comorbidity , poor mental health , poor social support , and cognitive functioning 
 were associated with treatment complications . in a prospective observational study that included mixed cancer diagnoses and stages ( n = 112 ) , 
 ( 95 ) reported that low grip strength was the only frailty marker ( of seven measured ) to predict treatment toxicity . 
 two other studies ( 3032 ) with sample sizes of 20 , 28 , and 49 participants ( most with breast cancer ) showed no difference in treatment toxicities with regard to geriatric assessment variables . these studies may have lacked statistical power to detect statistically significant associations . predictive validity of geriatric assessment for treatment complications

 geriatric assessment and prediction of mortality . 
 table 6 lists all studies that examined mortality as an outcome of domains of geriatric assessment . 
 sixteen studies examined the ability of geriatric assessment domains to predict mortality : 13 studies were prospective ( 18,20,23,24,29,34,35,3941,71,73,95 ) , two were cross - sectional ( 79,80 ) , one was retrospective ( 97 ) , and all studies included a variety of cancer diagnoses and stages . 
 the following geriatric assessment variables were associated with increased mortality across multiple studies ( 18,23,29,34,35,41,71,80 ) : older age , inadequate finances , mental health , comorbidity , high medication use , high groningen frailty indictor score , low mini nutritional assessment score , and impairments in activities of daily living . the majority of these studies adjusted for important confounders , such as sex , age , type of malignancy , stage of cancer , and comorbidity . 
 however , three studies with sample sizes of 54 to 182 reported that none of the geriatric assessment variables were independent predictors of mortality ( 71,95,97 ) . 
 predictive validity of geriatric assessment for mortality 
 na = not applicable ; nr = not reported ; hr = hazard ratio ; rr = relative risk ; or = odds ratio ; ci = confidence interval ; cci = charlson comorbidity index ; cirs = cumulative illness rating scale ; ecog ps = eastern collaborative group oncology performance status ; figo = international federation of gynecology and obstetrics ; gfi = groningen frailty indicator ; iadl = instrumental activities of daily living ; mhi 5 = mental health index 5 items ; kps = karnofsky performance status ; mna = mini nutritional assessment ; os = overall survival ; pfs = progression - free survival ; ves-13 = vulnerable elder survey-13 items ; who ps = world health organization performance status . 
 six studies ( 20,24,40,42,76,79 ) examined the survival of patients categorized as frail , vulnerable , or fit rather than according to individual components of the geriatric assessment . 
 these studies used tests such as  or log rank tests but did not examine predictive validity using multivariable analytic techniques . three studies examined overall survival , progression - free survival , and/or response to treatment in relation to geriatric assessment in univariate analyses only 
 ( 24 ) found no associations between the ves-13 score and overall survival , progression - free survival , or response to treatment . 
 ( 79 ) found that the incidence of treatment interruption was higher and had less benefit in terms of response in patients classified as frail according to the balducci classification . 
 massa et al . ( 76 ) reported better response in fit patients compared with frail patients ( how the patients were classified as fit , intermediate , and frail was not described ) , but it is not clear what analysis was conducted 
 two studies ( 23,94 ) examined the association between domains of geriatric assessment and the use of care ( supplementary table 4 , available online ) . in a prospective study with 337 colorectal cancer patients that adjusted for age and sex but not for illness severity and comorbidity , bailey et al . 
 ( 23 ) found that patients who were older and had poorer mental health had greater use of social resources . in a prospective study that used seven markers of frailty markers and 
 ( 94 ) reported that only one frailty marker , cognitive impairment , predicted visits to the emergency department after adjustment for confounders such as cancer type , cancer stage comorbidity , age , and sex . 
 five studies ( 22,23,34,66,91,98 ) reported that components of the geriatric assessment , such as age and functional status , were associated with the receipt of certain treatment modalities or regimens , such as surgery only . 
 other outcomes studied included changes in functional status , distress , clinical response , and discharge to usual place of residence after hospital admission ( supplementary table 4 , available online ) . 
 the quality of most studies was poor to moderate based on moose and prisma guidelines for reporting ( supplementary table 1 , available online ) . 
 of the 59 studies that were not chart reviews , 51 ( 86% ) did not report a response rate ( 1870 ) , and all but one ( 38 ) also did not report the reasons for refusal to participate in study . 
 furthermore , of the 73 studies , 13 ( 18% ) did not describe the study design ( 18,20,27,37,42,53,57,64,65,67,69,71,72 ) , and 12 ( 16% ) did not describe the setting in which the study was conducted ( 20,2224,33,42,44,49,51,53,61,70 ) . among the 28 prospective studies , nine ( 32% ) 
 the amount of missing data was not described in 41 ( 67% ) of 61 studies ( excluding studies that reported having complete data ) ( 2023,25,27,3335,3945,47,51,53,54,6063,66,6871,7384 ) , and 41 of 58 studies ( excluding studies that reported no missing data or how missing data were handled ) did not describe how the study authors dealt with missing data ( 2023,25,27,33,3739,4147,49,51,53,54,57,58,6064,6872,7485 ) . for 12 ( 16% ) of the 73 studies , 
 three ( 4% ) of the 73 studies did not describe all of the measurement instruments used in the study ( ie , geriatric assessment instruments , outcomes , predictors ) ( 20,42,52 ) . domains of geriatric assessment included in the 73 studies that examined geriatric assessment in the oncology setting 
 both instruments were used in more than 20% of the studies . 
 among studies that included the domain . 
 the characteristics of the 73 studies reported by the included articles are presented in supplementary table 2 ( available online ) . 
 twenty - five studies were conducted in north america : 23 in the united states  ( 25,3033,37,38,43,46,52,54,58,62,64,73,74,77,78,80,81,83,85,86 , 8892 ) and two in canada ( 9395 ) . 
 forty - three studies were conducted in europe : 19 in italy ( 20,26,3436,40,42 , 44,51,53,57,59,61,63,67,69,70,76,79 ) , 14 in france ( 19,2729,39,45,48,72,82,84,87 , 9698 ) , three in spain ( 47,55,56 ) , two in germany ( 41,68,99 ) , one in the united kingdom ( 22,23 ) , one in norway ( 71,75 ) , one in greece ( 24 ) , one in the netherlands ( 18 ) , and one in austria ( 65 ) .

 articles reporting on the same study . of the 73 studies that included geriatric assessment , 28 ( 38% ) were prospective observational studies ( 1841,71,7376,94,95,100 ) , 31 ( 42% ) were cross - sectional observational studies ( 4268,77,78,85,8890,93,99 ) , and 14 ( 19% ) were retrospective studies or chart reviews ( 69,70,72,7984,86,87,91,92,9698 ) . 
 none of the reviewed studies was a randomized controlled trial specifically designed to examine the effectiveness of geriatric assessment . in studies that investigated a new drug or treatment regimen ( 26,28,30,39,59,67,70 ) , 
 geriatric assessment was included in seven nonrandomized clinical drug trials ( 24,26,28,30,59,67,70 ) and no randomized controlled drug trial . 
 most of the studies recruited participants either through convenience sampling ( 25 studies ) ( 2426,3032,36,37,39,51,52,59,65 , 67,69,73,74,7678,84,8890,9395,97,99 ) or by consecutive sampling ( 32 studies ) ( 18,19,21,27,3335,40,41,4548,55,57,58,6064,66,68,71,75,79,80,82,85,86,91,92,96,98,100 ) techniques .

 performance status was assessed in 37 studies ( 20,21,24,3032,34,35,39,41,44 , 4648 ,  50,51,53,55,56,6071,74,75,8690,9398,100 ) . 
 information about the use of prescription medications was collected from patients in 22 studies ( 19,25,28,29,39,47,48,5052,55,56,63,66,71,72,75,78,82,84,85,92,98,99 ) , and in 14 of these 22 studies , the information obtained included the total number of prescriptions ( 25,29,39,47,48,51,52,63,66 ,  71,75,78,82,84,85,92 ) . 
 in 24 studies ( 19,22,23,25,28,38,48,5052,55,56,63,65,66,72,73,78,8486,8890,93,97,98 ) , geriatric assessment included the availability of social support and living arrangements , such as the availability of a caregiver . 
 the most commonly used objective measure of physical function was gait speed , which was included in 15 studies ( 25,29,43,45,50,52,61,64,65,72,78,84,87,88,9395 ) . 
 patient characteristics that were less often incorporated into geriatric assessments included symptoms [ assessed using a symptom inventory , two studies ( 22,23,85 ) ; fatigue or energy levels , seven studies ( 21,25,37,43,60,85,9395 ) ; pain , three studies ( 37,66,85 ) ; quality of life , seven studies ( 22,23,31,32,37,50,65,68,74 ) ; grip strength , five studies ( 43,64,87,9395 ) ; distress , three studies ( 66,85,89,90 ) ; and self - rated health , two studies ( 54,73 ) ] . in 30 of 73 studies , the results of geriatric assessment were summarized in a summary score ( 18,20,24,26,34,40,42,43,47,4951,54,55,66,70,7276,78,79,84,9396,98,99 ) . in 12 of those studies ( 20,24,40,47,50,54,75,79,84,96,98,99 ) , 
 the summary score used was the classification of fit , vulnerable , and frail developed by balducci and stanta ( 101 ) . in this classification 
 , frail refers to patients who are generally unfit for cancer treatment ( defined as those with any of the following characteristics : older than 85 years , more than two disabilities , multiple comorbidities , or the presence of geriatric syndromes ) and should receive best supportive care or palliative treatment ; fit ( defined as patients who are independent and have no clinically significant comorbid conditions ) indicates patients who should receive standard therapy ; and vulnerable ( defined as patients with one or two clinically significant comorbid conditions and/or instrumental activities of daily living disability but no activities of daily living disability ) refers to patients for which the standard treatment should be adjusted . 
 thirty studies reported some aspect of the feasibility of the geriatric assessment , such as time needed to complete the assessment and/or who ( study author , patient themselves , or others ) conducted the assessment ( 21,25,26,32,36,37,40,45,46,50,52,5558,60,66,69,7375,77,78,84,85,8789,93,94,99 ) . in most of these studies , the assessment was done through a face - to - face interview and generally took 1045 minutes . among studies that reported how many participants refused the assessment ( 26,74,78,94,95 ) , 
 only a small number of participants refused the assessments ( table 2 ) . in six studies ( 33,66,69,85,88,89 ) , 
 however , only four of those studies ( 66,85,88,89 ) reported on feasibility , and each showed that it was acceptable ( more than 75% of participants could complete the survey without assistance , and participants were satisfied with length of questionnaires and content ) . 
 eleven studies ( 19,37,46,49,51,55,57,65,78,81,83,99 ) reported psychometric properties or diagnostic accuracy of the geriatric assessment ( ie , validity , reliability , and/or sensitivity and specificity ) ( table 3 ) . 
 most of these studies examined diagnostic accuracy of one or more short geriatric assessment tools with those of a full geriatric assessment . 
 however , because these studies compared different screening instruments with different forms of full geriatric assessment or used the same instruments but with different cutoffs , it was not possible to summarize the results in a quantitative manner . 
 first , shorter forms of geriatric assessment generally had good diagnostic accuracy compared with a full geriatric assessment . 
 ( 19 ) found that concordance between individual domain scores from mini - geriatric assessment and from comprehensive geriatric assessment ranged from 66% to 83% . 
 second , four studies that compared the vulnerable elder survey-13 items ( ves-13 ) with a full geriatric assessment found that the former had excellent diagnostic accuracy , with an area under the curve that ranged from 0.83 to 0.90 , sensitivity that ranged from 54% to 87% , and specificity that ranged from 70% to 89% ( 49,51,55,78 ) . 
 in addition , one study ( 49 ) compared the groningen frailty indicator to a full geriatric assessment ; one study ( 55 ) compared the barber questionnaire to a full geriatric assessment ; and one study ( 99 ) compared expert physician judgment to the balducci classification . 
 thirty - seven studies ( 51% ) examined at least one of the four a priori specified outcomes presented below . 
 the outcomes use of geriatric assessment ( followed by interventions ) to avoid complications of treatment and health and functional status were not studied in the included studies . 
 below , the results for each of the studied outcomes are described . 
 geriatric assessment and treatment decision . 
 an important goal of geriatric assessment is to distinguish between older patients who are fit to undergo standard cancer treatments and frail older patients who would benefit from modified treatment or best supportive care . 
 only four studies ( 19,27,48,98 ) , all conducted in france , examined the impact of geriatric assessment before the start of treatment on the cancer treatment plan ( table 4 ) . in two studies ( 19,98 ) , 
 geriatric assessment did not influence the treatment decision , whereas in the other two studies ( 27,48 ) , geriatric assessment led to changes in the treatment plan for 40%50% of patients , mostly consisting of changes in the chemotherapy regimen . of note 
 ( 48 ) , the final treatment decision ( which took into account the results of the geriatric assessment ) was made by a doctor or team that was not the original doctor or team that conducted the geriatric assessment . in the study of chaibi 
 et al . ( 27 ) , patients were rediscussed at tumor board , where the multidisciplinary team decided to change their treatment recommendation based on the results of the geriatric assessment .

 ( 74 ) reported that assessment and interventions influenced the oncological treatment , but it was not clear how or how often they influenced the outcome . 
 the impact of geriatric assessment on the treatment decision was examined by marenco et al . 
 ( 34 ) in a prospective study with a variety of cancers and stages ( n = 571 ) , and by to et al . 
 ( 66 ) in a cross - sectional study with diverse cancers and stages ( n = 200 ) . however , it is not clear how treatment decisions were specifically impacted ( eg , increase in treatment dose or dose reduction was not reported ) in these two studies . 
 three studies ( 27,74,84 ) have shown that geriatric assessment led to geriatric interventions , such as nutritional interventions and treatment of depression before the start of treatment . 
 geriatric assessment and complications or toxicity of treatment . 
 table 5 lists all studies that examined complications or toxicity of treatment as an outcome of geriatric assessment . 
 nine studies ( 21,3033,35,71,73,75,95,100 ) that examined the impact of geriatric assessment on complications of any type of cancer treatment did not use multivariable analysis techniques . 
 complications were generally defined as grade 3 or 4 treatment - related toxicity , treatment interruptions , and postoperative complications , such as wound infections . in five studies with mixed cancer diagnoses and stages and sample sizes that ranged from 60 to 660 participants ( 21,33,35,71,75,100 ) , impairments in basic and instrument activities of daily living , comorbidity , poor mental health , poor social support , and cognitive functioning 
 were associated with treatment complications . in a prospective observational study that included mixed cancer diagnoses and stages ( n = 112 ) , 
 ( 95 ) reported that low grip strength was the only frailty marker ( of seven measured ) to predict treatment toxicity . 
 two other studies ( 3032 ) with sample sizes of 20 , 28 , and 49 participants ( most with breast cancer ) showed no difference in treatment toxicities with regard to geriatric assessment variables . these studies may have lacked statistical power to detect statistically significant associations . predictive validity of geriatric assessment for treatment complications

 geriatric assessment and prediction of mortality . 
 table 6 lists all studies that examined mortality as an outcome of domains of geriatric assessment . 
 sixteen studies examined the ability of geriatric assessment domains to predict mortality : 13 studies were prospective ( 18,20,23,24,29,34,35,3941,71,73,95 ) , two were cross - sectional ( 79,80 ) , one was retrospective ( 97 ) , and all studies included a variety of cancer diagnoses and stages . 
 the following geriatric assessment variables were associated with increased mortality across multiple studies ( 18,23,29,34,35,41,71,80 ) : older age , inadequate finances , mental health , comorbidity , high medication use , high groningen frailty indictor score , low mini nutritional assessment score , and impairments in activities of daily living . the majority of these studies adjusted for important confounders , such as sex , age , type of malignancy , stage of cancer , and comorbidity . 
 however , three studies with sample sizes of 54 to 182 reported that none of the geriatric assessment variables were independent predictors of mortality ( 71,95,97 ) .

 six studies ( 20,24,40,42,76,79 ) examined the survival of patients categorized as frail , vulnerable , or fit rather than according to individual components of the geriatric assessment . 
 these studies used tests such as  or log rank tests but did not examine predictive validity using multivariable analytic techniques . three studies examined overall survival , progression - free survival , and/or response to treatment in relation to geriatric assessment in univariate analyses only 
 ( 24 ) found no associations between the ves-13 score and overall survival , progression - free survival , or response to treatment . 
 ( 79 ) found that the incidence of treatment interruption was higher and had less benefit in terms of response in patients classified as frail according to the balducci classification . 
 ( 76 ) reported better response in fit patients compared with frail patients ( how the patients were classified as fit , intermediate , and frail was not described ) , but it is not clear what analysis was conducted . 
 geriatric assessment and the use of care and other outcomes . 
 two studies ( 23,94 ) examined the association between domains of geriatric assessment and the use of care ( supplementary table 4 , available online ) . in a prospective study with 337 colorectal cancer patients that adjusted for age and sex but not for illness severity and comorbidity , bailey et al . 
 ( 23 ) found that patients who were older and had poorer mental health had greater use of social resources . in a prospective study that used seven markers of frailty markers and 
 ( 94 ) reported that only one frailty marker , cognitive impairment , predicted visits to the emergency department after adjustment for confounders such as cancer type , cancer stage comorbidity , age , and sex . 
 five studies ( 22,23,34,66,91,98 ) reported that components of the geriatric assessment , such as age and functional status , were associated with the receipt of certain treatment modalities or regimens , such as surgery only . 
 other outcomes studied included changes in functional status , distress , clinical response , and discharge to usual place of residence after hospital admission ( supplementary table 4 , available online ) . 
 this is the first review , to our knowledge , to systematically summarize all available evidence with regard to the use and effectiveness of geriatric assessment in the oncology setting . 
 the evidence summarized in this review suggests that it is feasible to conduct a geriatric assessment in a hospital setting in older patients with cancer . 
 the use of a geriatric assessment in the hospital setting can identify many health and functional status issues that might not otherwise be known by the treating oncologist . 
 in addition , several domains of geriatric assessment are associated with oncological outcomes , such as toxicity of treatment and mortality , even in heterogeneous study populations . 
 the factors consistently associated with these outcomes include impairments in activities of daily living , comorbidity , and poor mental health . because most of the studies included heterogeneous study populations and featured small sample sizes , they had limited ability to conduct subgroup analyses . 
 thus , it was not possible to compare the results for solid tumors vs hematological malignancies or for cancers with different prognoses or treatment trajectories ( eg , adjuvant vs metastatic settings ) . 
 future studies in more homogeneous populations are needed to identify populations where geriatric assessment might be particularly useful in helping a physician select the cancer treatment , preventing adverse outcomes of cancer and its treatment . 
 we found that although many studies have incorporated some form of geriatric assessment to describe the patient population , fewer studies have examined the usefulness of geriatric assessment in terms of its ability to identify older adults at risk for adverse outcomes of cancer and its treatment . to date , no randomized controlled trial has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of geriatric assessment for distinguishing between fit and frail older adults to improve outcomes of cancer treatment compared with usual care in oncology . 
 nevertheless , experts in the field and siog ( 13,102 ) expect that by distinguishing between fit and more vulnerable and frail patients , treatment regimens can be adjusted to maximize the treatment effectiveness and avoid complications ; however , this expectation still needs to be proven in a randomized controlled trial setting . 
 even though no randomized controlled trial has examined the effectiveness of geriatric assessment in the oncology setting , the general principles of geriatric medicine and geriatric assessment are thought to apply to all older adults , including those with cancer . published guidelines and the recommendations of groups such as the nccn and the siog suggest that most clinicians accept the applicability of geriatric assessment in the oncology setting . however , we found no high - quality evidence ( ie , from randomized controlled trials ) that conducting a geriatric assessment and tailoring interventions based on its findings altered important patient outcomes in older cancer patients . 
 thus , based on the results of this systematic review , firm recommendations for implementing geriatric assessment and the type of geriatric assessment in routine clinical practice await additional study because the effectiveness of geriatric assessment in improving patient outcomes remains unclear . 
 rather , interventions that can improve patient outcomes are identified based on the geriatric assessment . 
 the aim of the traditional geriatric assessment is to predict functional decline and falls in an older population with cognitive and functional impairments . 
 therefore , it is not surprising that in many of the reviewed studies , geriatric assessment was not useful in predicting oncology outcomes , such as treatment toxicity . 
 ceiling effects ( ie , when most participants score the maximum score possible on a test because the test is unable to distinguish between individuals at the higher score range of the test ) , as reported by hurria et al . 
 ( 32 ) , could explain the null effect of geriatric assessment in predicting outcomes in many of the studies that were included in this review . 
 however , experts have recommended using geriatric assessment in clinical oncology practice because it is expected to improve care for older oncology patients by helping improve treatment selection , avoiding toxicity , and identifying undetected medical problems that can interfere with treatment ( 11,12,13 ) . 
 future studies should carefully consider which outcomes are most relevant in this population and how the geriatric assessment can be used to identify opportunities for effective interventions . 
 the necessary next step in geriatric oncology requires intervention studies based on geriatric assessment . a recent meta - analysis of 22 randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effect of geriatric assessment vs usual care on independence and discharge to usual residence after hospital admission for older adults admitted to the hospital showed those who received geriatric assessment prior to interventions were more likely to be alive and in their own homes at the 6-month follow - up and less likely to suffer death or deterioration ( 103 ) . 
 we used systemic methods to identify all relevant studies , and two reviewers independently assessed the titles and abstracts by following the prisma statement . 
 we also used various published quality assessment criteria to take into account different study designs included in this review . 
 our search strategy was inclusive : we did not exclude any study based on the methodological quality because this is the first systematic review providing a comprehensive overview of the use of geriatric assessment in the oncology setting . 
 a meta - analysis was not possible because the studies were heterogeneous with respect to geriatric assessment instruments , methods , study populations , and outcomes . 
 furthermore , the findings are limited by the heterogeneous scientific quality of the studies included . 
 although we tried to contact all study authors if there were questions regarding the study , we were not successful in contacting all study authors , especially because some studies were published 15 years ago . 
 it is thus possible that we rated some quality criteria of each of the individual studies during the quality assessment as unsatisfactory simply because they were not reported or because reporting guidelines such as strobe and moose for different study types were published more recently than some of the studies . 
 in addition , cancer treatment options for older adults have changed because more elder - friendly treatments are being developed with less toxicity . 
 these changes may have impacted the predictive validity results of the geriatric assessments reviewed in this systematic review . 
 in addition , we did not examine the feasibility or effectiveness of geriatric assessment by cancer type or stage . 
 as more studies are conducted , future systematic reviews should take cancer type and stage into account to examine the effectiveness of geriatric assessment in improving patient outcomes for different tumor types and stages . 
 there are four fundamental barriers to advancing the field of geriatric oncology as identified through this systematic review . 
 first and most important is the conceptual issue of the clinical value of a gold standard for geriatric assessment in the oncology setting . 
 there is also no consensus regarding which domains should be included in geriatric assessment and how the instruments should best be designed and used in the oncology setting . 
 the ability to compare newly developed , abbreviated , or otherwise - modified instruments with an idealized geriatric assessment is limited because the value of geriatric assessment in terms of predictive validity and impact on cancer treatment or patient outcomes is unclear . 
 for example , the value of geriatric assessment has not been rigorously compared with usual care in the oncology setting , particularly with respect to the impact on treatment decision making or patient outcomes . 
 this classification approach recommends standard therapy for fit patients , adjusted therapy for those classified as vulnerable , and best supportive care or palliative treatment for those classified as frail . 
 most authors have defined impairments in two or more domains of the geriatric assessment as criteria for classifying a patient as frail . 
 these approaches are not necessarily in agreement with the concept of frailty as it is used in the geriatric medicine setting ( 104 ) . in the latter context , frailty is not considered to be the endpoint of the continuum of fit to completely dependent ; rather , it represents a state where an individual is independent but at high risk for developing disability . 
 this inconsistent use of the concept of frailty by oncology and geriatric medicine may lead to confusion and hinder the translation of knowledge from research into clinical practice across different settings . 
 in addition , this varied usage hampers research because study results can not be compared across studies , both within geriatric oncology and across disciplines . 
 the third barrier is the lack of information about the psychometric properties of the tools used in the geriatric assessment . 
 most studies have used instruments that have been validated in the traditional geriatric medicine setting . 
 the properties of these instruments may be different in the oncology setting because the psychometric properties are determined by the clinical population studied . 
 the clinical population in the oncology setting might be different from the one in the geriatric medicine setting where the psychometric properties of these tools were studied . 
 older persons with moderate to severe disability or cognitive impairment are less likely to be referred to oncology clinics due to referral bias ( 105 ) . 
 thus , most likely , the population in the oncology setting has less cognitive impairment and better functional status than the population in which these tools were developed and tested . 
 therefore , the psychometric properties of geriatric assessment instruments should be examined within the geriatric oncology setting . 
 this would better allow clinicians and researchers to select or develop the most appropriate and effective tools to include in their geriatric assessment in the oncology setting . 
 finally , the quality of reporting for studies in the field of geriatric oncology should be improved . 
 our quality assessment of the published studies suggests that researchers conducting future studies need to report more details on the study design , setting , response rates , and follow - up so that other researchers and clinicians can better evaluate the generalizability of the findings to their own settings . 
 randomized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness of conducting geriatric assessment with standard oncological care on relevant oncology outcomes are urgently needed to move the field of geriatric oncology forward . 
 two studies ( 27,48 ) showed an impact of geriatric assessment on the cancer treatment decision , whereas two others did not ( 19,98 ) ; however , none of these studies was a randomized controlled trial . 
 several studies were published after the search for this systematic review was conducted ( 106112 ) . 
 two studies examined the impact of geriatric assessment on the treatment decision and showed that for the majority of patients geriatric assessment had no impact on the treatment decision ( 108,112 ) . 
 in addition , four studies that evaluated the predictive validity of geriatric assessment showed that geriatric assessment domains were predictive of cancer treatment outcomes , such as chemotherapy ( 106,109112 ) . 
 although geriatric assessment is recommended to be used in clinical settings for older adults with cancer by both nccn and siog ( 11,12,13 ) , in a public health care system with finite resources to allocate to competing health care interventions , showing the ( cost- ) effectiveness of a geriatric assessment in improving oncology outcomes for older adults is necessary for it to become standard of care . given that geriatric assessment has been recommended as the standard of care , the broad implementation of geriatric assessment in clinical settings is likely to improve oncology outcomes for older adults affected by cancer . 
 there is a dearth of studies examining the impact of geriatric assessment on the use of care , and this outcome should be included in future studies . 
 in addition , no study has examined the impact of geriatric assessment on quality of life , which , for older adults with cancer , is an important consideration ( 113,114 ) . 
 thus , there is a need for studies with improved methodological quality , larger sample sizes , and longitudinal design to obtain evidence for the use of geriatric assessment in older patients who are seen in diverse oncology settings . 
 furthermore , given the costs of conducting multidisciplinary geriatric assessments and the large number of older adults being seen in oncology , there is a need for a short screening tool with good psychometric properties to identify older adults that can benefit from a more in - depth geriatric assessment . 
 several such tools have been developed for the geriatric oncology setting , including the g-8 ( 115 ) and the instrument developed by hurria et al . 
 the effectiveness of such an approach  a screening tool for all older patients followed by an in - depth assessment of those deemed to be at risk  is not established and needs to be validated in randomized controlled trials . of course 
 , such screening tools will only be of value once randomized controlled trials have clearly demonstrated that resource - intensive comprehensive geriatric assessment is effective in improving outcomes compared with usual care in the oncology setting . 
 furthermore , organizations such as siog and nccn that advocate for some form of geriatric assessment should articulate more clearly the current state of knowledge with regard to the benefits and impact of geriatric assessment on specific outcomes along with highlighting the current large gap in evidence .

 no systematic review of the use of geriatric assessment in oncology has been conducted . 
 the goals of this systematic review were : 1 ) to provide an overview of all geriatric assessment instruments used in the oncology setting ; 2 ) to examine the feasibility and psychometric properties of those instruments ; and 3 ) to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of geriatric assessment in predicting or modifying outcomes ( including the impact on treatment decision making , toxicity of treatment , and mortality).methodswe searched medline , embase , psychinfo , cinahl , and the cochrane library for articles published in english , french , dutch , or german between january 1 , 1996 , and november 16 , 2010 , reporting on cross - sectional , longitudinal , interventional , or observational studies that assessed the feasibility or effectiveness of geriatric assessment instruments . 
 the quality of articles was evaluated using relevant quality assessment frameworks.resultswe identified 83 articles that reported on 73 studies . 
 the quality of most studies was poor to moderate . 
 eleven studies examined psychometric properties or diagnostic accuracy of the geriatric assessment instruments used . 
 the assessment generally took 1045min . 
 geriatric assessment was most often completed to describe a patient s health and functional status . 
 specific domains of geriatric assessment were associated with treatment toxicity in 6 of 9 studies and with mortality in 8 of 16 studies . of the four studies that examined the impact of geriatric assessment on the cancer treatment decision , two found that geriatric assessment impacted 40%50% of treatment decisions.conclusiongeriatric assessment in the oncology setting is feasible , and some domains are associated with adverse outcomes . 
 however , there is limited evidence that geriatric assessment impacted treatment decision making . 
 further research examining the effectiveness of geriatric assessment on treatment decisions and outcomes is needed ."
"falls are both common and debilitating in patients with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) . 
 they have devastating consequences for affected individuals , often leading to injuries , secondary immobility , and reduced quality of life . 
 survival is reduced once falls have occurred , although a recent report failed to identify a relationship between falls and mortality risk in pd . 
 falls are also important for the public health system , as the costs associated with falls and fall - related injuries are enormous . 
 a prospective 20-year follow - up of 136 patients with newly diagnosed pd confirmed the high prevalence of falls ( 87% ) and resulting fractures ( 35% ) . for the management of 
 environmental factors such as slippery floors , loose rugs , poor lighting , or inadequate footwear may also contribute . 
 there is an increasing awareness that freezing of gait - a sudden and episodically occurring inability to generate effective forward stepping movements - is one of the leading causes of falls , presumably because patients are caught by surprise due to the often unexpected nature of freezing events . 
 recent work has underscored the additional importance of cognitive impairment as a key factor contributing to both falls and freezing ; falls are an issue in demented patients in particular . 
 possible explanations for this link include more prominent dopaminergic denervation of the caudate nucleus   or more generalized cholinergic dysfunction . 
 preventing falls is generally perceived as being difficult , but is not impossible . given the complex multifactorial nature of falls and the experience in elderly non - parkinsonian populations , a multidisciplinary approach appears preferable , but for patients with pd this strategy is not yet backed by scientific evidence . 
 crucial elements in the therapeutic approach include optimizing pharmacotherapy - increasing pd medication for dopa - sensitive signs , and stopping sedative drugs - and tailored physiotherapy , based on evidence - based practice guidelines . here , we highlight a few important new developments in this field .

 asking about falls and their impact on daily functioning should be a standard part of the evaluation of patients with pd . while awaiting further evidence , neurologists should consider installing a multidisciplinary team approach to tackle the vexing problem of falls in patients with pd . 
 management involves a systematic search for risk factors for falling , and a subsequent multifactorial approach aimed at eliminating or alleviating all patient - related and environmental risk factors for falling . 
 apart from optimizing dopaminergic medication , cholinergic therapies are now beginning to enter the field of play as well . 
 fear of falling must be addressed , and immobilization must be avoided as long as independent movements can still be made reasonably safely . 
 the multidisciplinary team should ideally consist of trained and experienced professionals who treat large numbers of patients . using this integrated approach 
 , the goal should be to at least reduce falls or perhaps prevent them altogether , restore mobility and independence , and thereby help to maintain the quality of life for patients with pd .

"left ventricular thrombus ( lvt ) is one of the most common complications of myocardial infarction ( mi ) . 
 the incidence of lvt in patients with acute anterior mis in the prethrombolytic era is ranged from 20% to 40% and with a non anterior acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) and the risk of lvt was < 5% . although controversial , in the contemporary era of routine early revascularization and more aggressive anticoagulation , the incidence of lvt complicating as an anterior ami is likely reduced and is currently estimated at 5 - 15% . 
 the risk factors for the development of lvt are consistently irrespective of infarct treatment and include large infarct size , severe apical akinesia , or dyskinesia left ventricular ( lv ) aneurysm , and anterior mi . two - dimensional transthoracic echocardiography is the imaging modality used most often for assessing the presence , shape , and size of an lv mural thrombus with an excellent specificity of 85 - 90% and sensitivity of 95% . 
 here , we report a case of 40-year - old male patient who is presented in emergency department with the complaint of substernal chest pain radiating to left arm and back associated with sweating for the last 1 day , there was no history of dyspnea , palpitation , any limb weakness , or any history suggestive of transient ischemic attack and peripheral embolization . 
 his 12-lead electrocardiogram was suggestive of inferior wall mi [ figure 1 ] . his total leukocyte and eosinophil counts were normal , prothrombin time / international normalized ratio and activated partial thromboplastin time were normal , and other tests for hypercoagulable states were planned for the follow - up evaluation . 
 a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed bedside which revealed hypokinesia of basal , mid inferior , and inferoseptal wall [ figure 2 and video 1 ] . 
 surprisingly , it also revealed a mobile mass which is the most probably thrombus attached to hypokinetic inferobasal septum just near the lv outflow tract ( lvot ) [ figure 3 and video 2 ] . considering the possibility 
 that this mass was high risk for embolism , we planned for coronary angiogram followed by the surgical extraction of possible thrombus . 
 however , unfortunately , despite the proper counseling and explanation of the risk of embolism , the patient refused for further intervention and got discharged against medical advice . 
 small arrows showing hypokinesia of basal inferior septum , large arrow indicates left ventricle probable thrombus apical four chambers view 
 thrombi formation at basal interventricular septum near lvot is extremely rare as it is a region of high - velocity blood flow . 
 traditionally , the causes of lvt formation after acute st - segment elevation mi include segmental dysfunction of the infracted myocardium resulting in the stasis of blood , endocardial tissue inflammation that provides a thrombogenic surface and a hypercoagulable state . 
 the higher mortality has been reported in patients with lv thrombi after infarction , especially when these develop within the first 48 h after infarction . 
 the treatment for cardiac mass is a prompt surgical resection of the mass with the patients placed on cardiopulmonary bypass . 
 therefore , better understanding of the circumstances in which lv thrombosis occurs may influence the patient management . in our case , 
 thrombus formed at the very unusual site and could lead to dreaded complication for the patient . 
 the possible etiology of thrombus formation , in our case , is hypokinesia of basal septum due to mi , but the presence of a subtle septal rupture which is not detectable on echocardiography could not be ruled out .

"laparoscopic surgery has gained widespread acceptance in a variety of procedures , ranging from gastric fundoplication to cholecystectomy . 
 although laparoscopic appendectomy ( la ) is more expensive than is open appendectomy ( oa ) due to the costs of the disposable equipment , and can be more technically challenging in children , the overall cost of the operation has been shown to be similar to that of open appendectomy . 
 the real cost savings of la are due to the shorter postoperative length of hospital stay ( los ) and the infrequent postoperative complications . the ultimate reduction in postoperative hospital costs to make la 
 most cost - effective would be to perform the procedure as same - day surgery or so - called fast - track surgery . because it has been our observation that many children can be discharged within 24 hours after a laparoscopic appendectomy , we reviewed our records to determine its feasibility . 
 a retrospective chart review was performed on 79 children who underwent a laparoscopic operation for the suspected diagnosis of acute appendicitis over a 3-year period between july 1997 and july 2000 . 
 prior to the operation , if the diagnosis of acute appendicitis was unclear , the patients were evaluated with further laboratory and diagnostic testing , which included an abdominal computed tomography scan or ultrasound evaluation , or both of these , in select patients . 
 laboratory information included white blood count and urinalysis , and depending on the circumstances , might also include a beta human chorionic gonadotropin and rapid streptococcal screen , as well as other tests as indicated . 
 all patients underwent the operation while under general anesthesia , and all received a single dose of a broad - spectrum antibiotic preoperatively for wound infection prophylaxis . 
 the standard laparoscopic operative technique was used , with either a 5-mm or 12-mm port introduced at the umbilicus after inducing pneumoperitoneum with carbon dioxide . a 0- or 30-degree laparoscopic telescope 
 was then introduced through this port , and the abdominal and pelvic cavities were directly visualized with the laparoscope to inspect for other possible pathologies . 
 next , two 5-mm ports were introduced under direct vision , one in the suprapubic region or the left lower quadrant and another in the right iliac fossa or in the right upper quadrant . 
 the appendix was identified and grasped by its distal end to fully expose the entire organ and its attached structures . 
 the appendiceal artery was isolated , ligated , and divided or cauterized . at that point , 
 a staple line was fired across the base of the appendix by using an endoscopic stapler , or endoscopic loops were used to isolate the base of the appendix , and it was divided . 
 if the appendix was particularly enlarged or friable , it was removed from the abdomen through the umbilical incision with the use of an endoscopic bag . 
 all ports were removed under direct visualization , and the fascia was reapproximated to prevent future incisional hernia occurrences . 
 if any evidence of localized or generalized peritonitis was visualized during the operation , patients were sent home on oral antibiotics , usually a 5-day course of amoxicillin plus clavulanate . 
 if the appendix was perforated prior to removal , patients were placed on triple antibiotic coverage intravenously , which included ampicillin , gentamicin , and clindamycin for 5 days while in the hospital . 
 if any evidence of abscess formation or peritoneal soilage was noted , the abdominal cavity was vigorously lavaged with normal saline . 
 postoperative analgesia was obtained usually with ketorolac tromethamine and acetaminophen . to be discharged home , patients had to be tolerating oral liquids , be afebrile , and free of nausea and vomiting . 
 seventy - nine children ( 44 boys and 35 girls ) between 2 to 17 years of age ( mean , 11 years ) underwent la . in 4 ( 5% ) children , all with perforated appendicitis , the la was converted to an open appendectomy , secondary to technical difficulties in completing the operation laparoscopically . at operation , 51 ( 64.5% ) 
 had acute appendicitis , 22 ( 27.8% ) had perforated appendicitis , 4 ( 5% ) had ruptured ovarian cysts , and 2 ( 2.5% ) had no obvious pathology . 
 total los for all 79 patients was a median of 58 hours , and median postoperative los was 35 hours . 
 complications included wound infection , 2 ( 2.5% ) ; abdominal abscess , 4 ( 5% ) ; drug rash , 2 ; and epididymoorchitis , 1 . 
 all but one complication ( drug rash , 1 ) occurred in the perforated group . in the 57 ( 72% ) children without perforated appendicitis , the total los was a median of 42 hours , while median postoperative los was only 28 hours . 
 thirty - two ( 56% ) of the children without perforated appendicitis went home in 24 hours following la . 
 no significant morbidity occurred in the nonperforated group ( drug rash , 1 ; fever > 24 hrs , 3 ) ; and no readmissions or reoperations were necessary on follow - up . 
 although most appendectomies , especially in children , are not done laparoscopically , many studies have shown that laparoscopic appendectomy ( la ) is at least as good as open appendectomy ( oa ) , with several benefits , including less postoperative pain and shorter lengths of stay ( los ) . 
 the disadvantages of la , which include increased operative time and increased cost of equipment , are easily offset by the decreased postoperative recovery time and the apparent decreased incidence of postoperative complications . additionally , it has been suggested that with increasing operative experience the operative time required for la will decrease significantly . 
 lastly , it has been suggested that even if patients are not discharged from the hospital soon enough after la to make a significant difference between the cost of la versus oa , la has a much shorter recovery time and returns patients to a productive lifestyle sooner , thus justifying la . 
 although most children are not working , the care - givers or parents can return to work sooner , when their child goes back to school . 
 adult series have documented a decreased incidence of postoperative complications and a decreased incidence of wound infection after la . 
 , in our series , 2 patients had wound infection and 4 patients developed abscesses , which is a similar complication rate to that in other series . in all instances , these complications arose in the perforated group . 
 although perforation was at first considered a contraindication for la , it has now been utilized successfully in the management of acute appendicitis as well as perforated appendicitis . 
 it has been suggested that thorough lavage of the abdominal cavity after appendectomy can help to decrease the incidence of abscess formation , and this is a practice that we utilize and is facilitated by the use of laparoscopy . 
 certainly , the laparoscopic approach facilitates the complete irrigation of the abdominal cavity and identification of all loculated collections . 
 an additional benefit of laparoscopic surgery is that it leads to greater accuracy of diagnosis , especially in teenage female patients with suspected appendicitis . in cases such as obesity and mental retardation , the diagnosis of appendicitis 
 laparoscopy can be used to delineate the source of abdominal pain when the diagnosis of appendicitis is suspected but not certain . in 4 of our patients with the presumed diagnosis of appendicitis , 
 intraoperative visualization revealed normal appendices , and ruptured ovarian cysts were identified as the source of their pain . obviously , all four patients were female . 
 others have also found an increased preponderance of unclear diagnoses in the female population . in our patients , 
 the appendix was always removed at the time of operation , despite the fact that occasionally ( in 4 patients ) the gross appearance of the appendix was normal . in the past 
 , it has been unclear whether it would be of any benefit to the patient to remove a healthy organ , but it has been argued that with advances in laparoscopy and its proven benefit , there is no justification for leaving a visually normal appendix in place . additionally , microscopic evidence of early appendicitis is occasionally seen . in our study , it was noted that 2 visually normal appendices were found to have microscopic evidence of appendicitis . 
 outpatient surgery has been widely accepted in a variety of procedures , and many are done laparoscopically . the idea that an appendectomy can be done in the pediatric patient as outpatient surgery is not a new one . in 1993 , 
 ramesh and gallard suggested early discharge after open appendectomy , even within 24 hours . in another study , 
 velhote et al also found that most children could be sent home within 24 hours after appendectomy . in that study 
 , the appendectomy was performed through a standard gridiron incision of 2 cm or less . 
 brosseuk and bathe suggested laparoscopic appendectomy as outpatient surgery in 1999 , and they advocated early discharge in both perforated and simple appendicitis . 
 the fact that all major complications in our study occurred in perforated cases would argue against these cases being performed as same - day surgery , although others have disputed this approach . in our treatment protocol 
 , perforated appendicitis would not be placed on a fast - track surgery list because these patients usually receive inpatient intravenous antibiotic therapy for 72 hours . 
 we suggest that laparoscopic appendectomy is a safe and effective treatment in the pediatric population , and that in cases of nonperforated appendicitis this may be performed as a fast - track or short - stay procedure . 
 we believe that this not only is more convenient for patients and their families , but it also adds to the overall cost - effectiveness of laparoscopic appendectomy . 
 our findings are based on a retrospective review of our charts over the past 3 years , and this is an obvious criticism of the study . in no instance was it prospectively decided that the child would be discharged within 24 hours . 
 in fact , a small number of children met exclusion criteria due to delays in discharge not related to their medical condition . 
 we made our best attempt to identify when the order was given for the child to be released rather than the actual time that the child left the hospital . 
 however , the documentation was occasionally unclear , and these children were excluded if it could not be ascertained exactly when the order was given or when they left the hospital . 
 we believe that in cases of simple appendicitis , there is no reason not to dismiss a child within 24 hours if the above - mentioned discharge criteria are met . 
 we anticipate that in the future , a greater percentage of our pediatric patients will be discharged within 24 hours , and we feel that in cases of simple appendicitis , laparoscopic appendectomy can be done as fast - track or short - stay surgery . 
 it may be safely performed as fast - track or same - day surgery , in select children without perforated appendicitis , with a postoperative stay of 24 hours in the majority of such patients .","although laparoscopic appendectomy la expensive open appendectomy oa due costs disposable equipment technically challenging children overall cost operation shown similar open appendectomy

"in many ways , cidp resembles a chronic form of gbs.10,14 cidp differs from gbs in that few patients recall preceding infections or other triggering events . also , unlike the putative role of antiganglioside antibodies in some gbs variants ( e.g. , aman ) , 
 no single major target antigen(s ) has been identified in cidp.14,23 nevertheless , plasma exchange ( plex ) , which presumably removes autoantibodies , complement , and cytokines / other soluble factors , is very effective in cidp as well as in gbs , with many patients responding within a few days.10,2326 reports of clinical improvement after the use of immunoadsorbents to selectively remove immunoglobulins in small series of cidp and gbs also suggest a direct role of autoantibodies in these conditions.27,28 the importance of autoantibodies may also be supported by reports that some mmn and cidp patients improve with the anti - b cell antibody , rituximab,8,29 although this effect was not observed in all studies.30 antibodies against peripheral myelin proteins including neurofascin and contactin-1 , pmp 22 , and p0 ; nodal proteins including gliomedin ; and/or gangliosides have been reported in sera of cidp patients.3141 antibodies against any individual defined antigen are relatively infrequent in any particular series , however , and in the majority of cidp patients the antigenic target is unknown.14,23 animal studies , including induction of cidp - like experimental 
 neuritis by immunization with myelin or myelin proteins , and passive transfer studies also support a role for antibodies in the pathogenesis of cidp.13,26,33 shifts in the balance of helper , effector , and regulatory t - cell subsets in the blood of cidp patients and elevations of t - cell derived cytokines all support a role for t - cells in inducing or maintaining the autoantibody response.4149 however , the t - cells and macrophages in biopsies appear predominately in perivascular areas , rather than along the nerve fiber itself.5052 the relative paucity of t - cell infiltrates in nerve biopsies from cidp patients and the lack of cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis51 cast doubt on the role t - cells as major effectors of nerve damage / dysfunction per se . together with the range of recognizable clinical variants of cidp,12,53 
 these observations suggest heterogeneity of the autoimmune pathology and chronic neural dysfunction.12 characteristic findings on microscopic pathology of cidp include segmental demyelination/ remyelination.50,54  onion bulbs ,  thought to represent a response of schwann cells and macrophages to repeated cycles of injury and repair , may also be seen . 
 the presence of segmental demyelination and onion bulbs certainly suggest that myelin disruption plays a role in cidp pathogenesis and the disability experienced by patients.51,52,5558 myelin disruption , however , may only be a partial explanation and may occur later than the initial stages of the disease . 
 electrophysiologic studies are beginning to highlight the importance of nodal dysfunction , and they suggest that rapid reversal of disability may be tied to improvement in nodal function.1521,55,5961 classical electrophysiologic findings considered important for the diagnosis of cidp include multifocal conduction velocity slowing , distal latency prolongation , conduction block , and temporal dispersion , which have generally been considered indicative of demyelination.14,61,62 studies of axonal excitability using the responses to multiple stimuli , strength - duration relationships , and excitability - recovery protocols offer a complementary mechanism that may be particularly relevant to the clinical experience of some cidp patients . in a study of cidp patients , measurements of axonal excitability in response 
 to subthreshold polarizing currents ( threshold electrotonus ) were interpreted as showing hyperpolarizing changes.60 in another study of cidp patients , stimulus - response curves suggested increased threshold requirements.59 nerve excitability has also been studied before and after ivig administration . 
 duration time constant was observed shortly after ivig infusions in patients with both mmn and cidp , perhaps reflecting a reduction in the persistent na current.16 these membrane changes may be mediated by autoantibodies capable of disrupting na+ channel clusters and functions of na+/k+ atpases in nodes of ranvier , resulting in hyperpolarization and decreased excitability.1518,20,21 similar electrophysiologic changes can be replicated in laboratory animals with antiganglioside antibodies and complement63 or by immunizing animals against gliomedin.13 although focal demyelination is often considered the cause of conduction block , nodal excitability changes resulting in increased thresholds for nerve stimulation may be an alternative explanation for this classic electrophysiologic finding in cidp.59 clinical response to ivig or plex may occur rapidly , often within just a few days . 
 remyelination or axonal regeneration , while likely important in eventual recovery , are implausible as explanations for this rapid clinical improvement.16,55 small studies of recordings obtained just before and at various time points after individual ivig doses have been interpreted to suggest that improvements in motor performance correspond to rapid but reversible changes in nodal function.1618,20 the duration of improvements in axonal excitability and muscle strength may be limited , with a return to the preinfusion baseline before the next dose of ivig is due.15,18,21 an interesting analogy may be found in a recent report of mg patients who responded to ivig . 
 thirty - two of the 37 patients reported improvement within a few days after each ivig infusion but worsening of myasthenic symptoms a few days before their next scheduled ivig infusion.9 no change in achr antibody titers were observed , even with prolonged ivig therapy . 
 therefore , the authors concluded that the major effect of ivig was to neutralize the autoantibody , rather than to suppress its production , and that ivig was , therefore , not a  disease modifying treatment  in mg.9 a dramatic example of this phenomenon in cidp is shown in figure 1 . in cases 
 in which the therapeutic effects of ivig do not persist throughout the usual 28 to 30 day dosing interval , improved management of rapidly reversible responses may offer an important opportunity for optimizing short - term treatment effects . 
 further studies are needed to determine if optimizing short - term responses affects the long term prognosis of cidp .

 mmn is distinguished by demonstrating multiple conduction blocks limited to motor nerves , with sparing of sensory nerves.6467 the electrophysiologically demonstrated conduction blocks have been considered a consequence of segmental demyelination , but recent studies suggest immunologic target(s ) actually on axons rather than / or in addition to schwann cells or myelin per se.67 a major puzzle in understanding mmn is the observation that corticosteroids and plex are usually not effective,64,65,67 while ivig has become the standard of care.68 approximately half of mmn patients have igm antibodies against the ganglioside gm1 , and these seropositive patients tend to have more severe weakness , disability , and eventual axon loss than seronegative patients.69 mmn patients ' sera containing igm anti - gm1 have been shown to activate complement in vitro,70,71 so it is possible that ivig is acting mainly by inhibiting c3 ( third component of serum complement system ) activation and/or deposition on ganglioside - rich domains of axonal membranes.21,71 although the complement membrane attack complex is often considered a lytic lesion which kills cells , sublytic attack can also occur , because nucleated cells can remove membrane attack complex pores by shedding or internalizing microscopic membrane vesicles.72 when this occurs , functionally important membrane proteins can be lost . 
 this type of membrane loss is believed to explain the  simplification  of postsynaptic membrane folds and loss of achr in mg22 and might be hypothesized to occur at nodes of ranvier in mmn.21 yuki et al . 
 have shown that in mmn , igm - induced complement - mediated injury occurs at the nodes of ranvier , which in turn leads to conduction block and muscle weakness.71 they further showed that ivig can block antiganglioside antibody binding in a dose - dependent manner.71 using stimulus strength  duration measurements to assess motor axon excitability , priori et al 
 . showed that axonal hyperpolarization occurs in mmn , suggesting that antibody - mediated inactivation of the na+ channels at the nodal membrane contributes to the apparent conduction block.73 boerio et al . performed nerve excitability studies before and just after ivig treatment in mmn ( and cidp ) patients . 
 they reported that ivig improved axonal excitability , which they attributed to restoration of na+ channel expression and/or activity.16 these electrophysiological observations could potentially explain why effects of ivig may improve muscle strength shortly after each infusion but wane in subsequent weeks.7375 thus , taken together , the results of these recent studies of axonal excitability in cidp and mmn , the absence of clearly identifiable effector cells attacking the involved nerves , and the rapid responses to ivig reported in both disorders suggest that autoantibodies (  complement ) may disrupt axon function in addition to inducing structural damage . in turn 
 , the reports of rapidity and reversibility of the responses to igg infusions in some cases may suggest competition between infused therapeutic igg and endogenous pathologic antibodies.21 a corollary of this hypothesis is that the specificities , titer , and affinities of the autoantibodies being produced by any given patient at any point in time , together with the susceptibility of the target axons , may be important determinants of the treatment regimen required to optimally manage that particular patient at that time . 
 the initial dose of ivig used for most autoimmune / inflammatory diseases follows a regimen serendipitously found effective shortly after ivig was introduced in 1981 . 
 four cll patients with thrombocytopenia and concomitant immune deficiency had increased platelet counts after receiving what was then the standard monthly dose of ivig for antibody replacement , 0.4 gm / kg . because of the rise in the platelet count , the ivig dose was repeated the next day , then also on the remaining working days ( but not the weekend days ) of the same week , leading to a cumulative dose of 2 gm / kg given over 45 days.76 a subsequent randomized , multicenter trial comparing the 0.4 gm / kg per day  5 regimen with a single infusion of 2 gm / kg over 10 h in children with kawasaki syndrome found that the latter was more effective in preventing aneurysms and led to faster resolution of fever and biochemical markers of inflammation.77 this suggests that the peak igg level is the most important determinant of the success of therapy in some situations . 
 however , kawasaki syndrome , like gbs , is considered an acute monophasic disease ; while cidp , mmn , and mg are chronic disorders . 
 in current neurologic practice , a  loading dose  of 2 gm / kg divided over 25 days is usually followed by maintenance doses of 12 gm / kg every 36 weeks.68,78 infusion of 2 gm / kg of ivig increases the serum igg level > 4-fold , from pretreatment means of 7001,060 mg / dl to peaks well over 3,000 mg / dl.78 the levels then drop by approximately 50% over 4872 h , as igg is distributed into the total extracellular fluid volume , which is approximately double the intravascular volume.78,79 after this rapid equilibration , the igg is catabolized with first - order kinetics and a half - life of 2130 days , so infusions are usually repeated monthly.7881 the relatively slow catabolism of igg as compared to other plasma proteins is due to a saturable endothelial cell receptor which protects endocytosed igg from lysosomal degradation and returns it to the plasma.80,82 saturation of this receptor with high concentrations of normal igg from exogenous ivig keeps endogenous pathologic igg from the recycling pathway and increases its degradation.83 this is likely an important concentration - dependent mechanism by which ivig can compete with autoantibodies without affecting their production.21,83 reports of patients responsive but chronically dependent upon ivig support the notion that the effects of each dose are transient , without any cumulative effect.9,21 certainly , not all patients are chronically dependent on ivig ; up to 30% might achieve long - term drug free remission . whether these observations can be explained by spontaneous remission with neuronal integrity supported by ivig while the disease is in the active state , or if ivig fundamentally alters the immune process remains to be clarified . in either case , 
 accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that the infused antibodies in ivig compete with putative pathologic antibodies and/or complement , and that the effect diminishes as the relative concentrations of normal versus pathologic antibodies decrease with time after each dose.21,83 in contrast to intravenously administered igg , with subcutaneously administered igg ( scig ) , the initial direction of the movement of igg is opposite that of ivig . 
 scig is first absorbed into and transported through lymphatics , then enters the bloodstream by means of the thoracic duct.84 equilibration of the igg from scig into the intravascular space requires approximately the same amount of time as equilibration of ivig out of the intravascular compartment , 3672 h.8486 the peak serum concentration achieved with scig is , on average , only 61% of the peak achieved with iv infusions of the same dose.86 the slower rate of rise toward the peak and the truncation of its height are believed to be responsible for the much lower incidence of systemic adverse effects ( aes ) with scig.84,85,87 this is consistent with numerous reports that many of the aes of ivig infusions are rate - related and can be obviated by giving the igg by the sc route.87,88 no differences have been reported in the half - lives ( t1/2 ) of igg given by the sc versus iv routes , generally reported to be approximately 3035 days with currently marketed igg products.81,85,86 because of the low incidence of systemic aes and lack of a requirement for venous access , scig is commonly self - administered at home , usually weekly.89 with weekly scig , only a few days elapse between the peak serum level from 1 dose and administration of the next dose . 
 serum igg levels experienced 34 weeks after a large bolus of ivig.85 pooled data from 7 studies in which equivalent monthly igg doses were given as weekly scig infusions versus ivig boluses every 2128 days showed that trough serum igg levels were higher by 1020% ( mean  =  12.7% ) with weekly scig.81,85,86 after 612 weekly infusions , scig results in near - steady - state igg levels , with peak - trough differences only approximately 5% of the overall mean.85,86 in contrast , with ivig the trough - to - peak difference is often greater than 100% of the overall mean.81,89 as with any other therapy , the shorter the interval between doses , the higher the trough level and the smaller the difference between peak and trough levels are likely to be , regardless of the route of administration.81,89,90 the overall bioavailability of scig is approximately 30% lower than that of ivig , presumably because of binding to extracellular matrix and/or degradation in the tissues.91 for this reason , to achieve the same total systemic exposure to igg , defined by the area under the curve ( auc ) of serum igg versus time , it is necessary to increase the monthly dose of scig by 30 to 50% compared with the monthly dose of ivig.86,91 however , there is little evidence which supports basing doses on the auc , as opposed to the trough serum igg level . 
 typical pk curves from ivig and scig in a patient with primary immunodeficiency ( pidd ) who makes only minimal endogenous igg are shown in figure 2a and b. the large differences in peak and trough on ivig versus the near steady - state serum igg levels with scig are readily apparent . if the effect of therapeutic igg is proportional to its serum concentration at any point in time ( for example , in pidd , the moment when exposure to an infectious agent occurs ) , it is easy to see how the effect of ivig would wane as it is metabolized and its concentration decreases . 
 figure 2c shows a prototypic pk curve for monthly ivig superimposed on the muscle - strength curve from figure 1 , while the patient was on monthly ivig but no other anti - inflammatory or immunosuppressive treatment . 
 seen in this way , it is quite easy to understand why there would be a rapid response to the markedly increased serum igg level in the few days just after an intravenous dose , but also why that effect begins to  wear off

 note the increase in muscle strength accompanying the rapid rise in serum igg level following each monthly dose , but then the decrease in strength shortly after the igg level falls . 
 the diagnosis of cidp requires integration of clinical , electrophysiological , and laboratory data as well as collection of appropriate exclusionary information . often the diagnosis is not straightforward . a recent editorial by cornblath et al . 
 suggests that as many as one - third of cidp patients in the us have been incorrectly diagnosed and may be receiving inappropriate treatment.62 therefore , strict adherence to scientifically derived and consensus clinical diagnostic criteria is critical.62 after the cidp diagnosis is confirmed , ensuring that treatment is effective , tolerable , and minimizes the patient 's disability become the major goals . based upon results of the largest controlled trial of ivig in cidp , the  study of ivig , 10% caprylate - chromatography purified for the treatment of cidp 
 ( ice trial ) , the food and drug administration ( us ) approved ivig for cidp using a loading a dose of 2 gm / kg followed by maintenance dosing of 1 gm / kg every 3 weeks.92 however , optimal ivig doses and infusion intervals across a broader range of patients have yet to be clearly established , and prescribing regimens other than those used in the ice trial are common.9395 wide inter - patient variations in the pharmacokinetics of ivig9497 further highlight the need to individualize dosing to achieve an optimal treatment response . 
 nonetheless , relatively little emphasis has been placed on determining how to maximize treatment efficacy . 
 there are anecdotal reports of patients asking for  booster  doses of ivig before their next monthly dose is due , but few reports of objective measurements which correlate with these  end of dose  effects . in the absence of a validated laboratory biomarker or any other way to establish a 
 igg level,98 frequent measurements of muscle strength and functional capabilities may provide the best basis for individualizing and optimizing therapy ( see the unanswered questions/ research issues section ) . 
 studies in patients with primary antibody deficiency have demonstrated that different individuals require different serum igg levels to remain free from infection,97,99 and that there is very wide variability in igg dose and treatment interval necessary to achieve and maintain clinically determined  target  igg levels in different patients.86,97 gbs may have a similar dose 
 reported that serum igg levels obtained 2 weeks after ivig 2 gm / kg showed a large degree of pharmacokinetic variation and that those patients with greater increments in their serum igg levels had better clinical outcomes at 6 months posttreatment.96 in a prospective study in cidp , the same group showed that different patients required different ivig dosing intervals and serum igg levels to achieve and maintain optimal clinical responses.90 the mean trough serum igg level ( just before each dose was given ) required by the subset of these patients on a single ivig product ( n  =  17 ) was 1,500 mg / dl , but the range was 1,100 to 1,900 mg / dl.90 besides the suggestion that different patients require different igg levels to achieve maximum muscle strength , the doses and treatment intervals required to achieve and maintain any given igg level are also likely to vary greatly between individuals.90,9395,98 many immunodeficient patients report feeling better and remain free from recurrent symptoms of chronic low - grade infection when their serum igg level is maintained at a steady - state with the use of weekly scig.100 a few reports suggest that maintaining high steady state levels of normal igg by the use of scig may also be beneficial in cidp and mmn ( see below ) , but additional studies are needed . as with plex , the initial response to ivig in many patients with cidp is rapid , with symptomatic improvement beginning within days.101103 the beneficial effect generally wanes within weeks , and ivig infusions are repeated at regular intervals , often for years.104 harbo et al . reported that 6 of 11 cidp patients on individualized ivig regimens began to lose strength within a few days when their ivig was delayed beyond the usual interval.105 conversely , they began to regain strength in 5 days after an ivig dose , although a plateau was not achieved for 15 days.106 in the  ice  trial , improvements in grip strength and incat score in responding subjects were seen at the first post - ivig determination 16 days after the infusion.101103 further improvement was recorded at 3 and 6 weeks , but repeated measurements were not taken before and after subsequent doses of ivig.101  wearing off  of the effect of each dose of ivig may be a reason that as many as 30% of cidp patients had dosing intervals of 15 days in a us survey93 and    21 days in a uk study94 ( fig . 
 recently reported results of a study in which they confirmed ivig dependency by determining whether reducing the dose increased the patient 's disability . 
 they then used assessments of grip strength ( vigorometer ) , mrc sum score , incat sensory score , and disability assessments as part of a protocol for optimizing the ivig regimen in which the dose was increased until the  maximal clinical response 
 end of dose symptoms and signs.90 although the frequency of the efficacy measurements was not described , the use of this protocol resulted in 52% of the patients receiving ivig at intervals of 1014 days and an additional 8% receiving ivig at intervals < 10 days90 ( bottom bar , fig . 
 the utility of hand grip strength measurements is also supported by a cross - sectional analysis of 31 cidp patients using dynamometry , electrophysiology , and conventional clinical assessments , from which rajabally and narashimhan reported highly significant correlations between jamar dynamometer measurements and results of global and upper extremity motor and sensory scores.107 ultimately , frequent measurements with hand grip dynamometers or other devices the patient can be instructed to use at home should help determine the proportion of patients who might benefit by weekly or even more frequent igg dosing , and help to identify the treatment regimens which yield the best long - term results . 
 larger and longer studies using tools like grip strength monitoring that specifically address the short and long term consequences of treatment - related clinical fluctuations are needed . 
 actual ivig dosing intervals used for cidp patients in practice : horizontal bars indicate % of cidp patients receiving ivig at intervals    14 days in each study . 
 rajabally in the uk and kuitwaard in holland performed prospective studies designed to optimize responses , n  =  15 and 25 , respectively . 
 . reported on a cross - sectional analysis of prescriptions for ivig therapy for 46 unique patients from a home care / specialty pharmacy by 30 different doctors in the us . 
 if weekly or more frequent igg dosing seems desirable on clinical grounds , self - administration of scig at home offers a practical route to maintain high steady - state igg levels . 
 the safety , efficacy and practicality of this route of therapy in cidp has been described in case reports and a small randomized , placebo controlled study,109111 and is now being evaluated in a large multicenter trial.112 some of the patients in these studies reported improved tolerability , increased independence , and stabilization of clinical status.109111 while these factors may not be applicable to all patients , the possibility of maximizing treatment by maintaining a high steady - state igg level by means of a potentially more tolerable route of igg administration ( i.e. , sc ) is attractive . 
 if cidp patients have a better response to higher igg levels , as reported in a recent study in gbs,96 and different patients require different igg doses and treatment intervals to achieve optimal clinical responses,90,9395,98 then frequent clinical monitoring and correlation with frequent serum igg levels may identify those patients who benefit most from frequent iv infusions or the use of scig . the possibility that minimizing treatment - related clinical fluctuations may result in better long - term outcomes remains to be determined in long - term studies . 
 responsiveness of the majority of mmn patients to ivig despite the lack of response to plex113 or corticosteroids114 was demonstrated in the mid-90s by multiple anecdotal and case - series reports.114116 small controlled studies soon followed,117120 and the results of a 44-subject randomized , double - blinded placebo - controlled , crossover trial were reported by hahn et al . in 2013.120 
 mean maximal grip strength declined 31% during placebo treatment and increased 3.75% during ivig treatment ( p  =  0.005),120 ivig was recommended as first - line treatment by a european federation of neurologic societies / peripheral nerve society task force in 2006121 and 2010.68 of interest , even early reports noted that improvement associated with reduction in the degree of conduction block began within a few days , but lasted only 12 months , at best.114,115 others observed that the beneficial effects of ivig generally decrease over time.74,75,122 although increasing the dose or shortening the interval generally restores short - term efficacy , gradual worsening with progressive reduction of mrc sum scores and/or distal cmap amplitudes still occurs commonly.74,75 baumann et al . , reported that the use of a protocol designed to determine the lowest effective ivig dose and longest tolerable interval resulted in slowly progressive muscle weakness over a 4-year period while the patients received a mean of 0.5 gm / kg / month of ivig given at 4- to 12-week intervals.123 the investigators subsequently performed a prospective dose escalation study and observed that 6 of 9 subjects improved when their dose was increased to 1.2 gm / kg / month . 
 the authors concluded that their initial strategy of trying to find the lowest dose at the longest tolerated interval resulted in significant underdosing.123 others have also reported that mmn patients gradually decline despite therapy and need slowly escalating ivig doses to maintain their strength.74,75,122 notably , these reports initially used mean cumulative ivig doses equal to or less than 1.2 gr / kg / mo.74,75,122 in contrast , vucic et al . reported the results over a 7.25 year mean follow - up period of 10 patients initially treated with 3 courses of 2 gm / kg ivig at 4 week intervals then maintained on a mean ivig dose of 1.63 gm / kg/4 weeks . 
 muscle strength in these patients was stable , the number of nerve segments showing conduction block decreased by 45% , and distal compound muscle action potential amplitudes were stable or improved.124 thus , we have much to learn about optimizing the use of igg in mmn . early diagnosis and institution of therapy , followed by close monitoring and frequent adjustment of dose and interval to assure that the patients are achieving maximal short - term responses may offer the best chances for favorable long - term outcomes . 
 monthly ivig is now the accepted first - line treatment for mmn.68,121 even so , treatment - related fluctuations in strength and  end - of - dose  weakness are also reported in this condition.125 several case reports and small case series have suggested that scig may be as effective as ivig for long - term maintenance of strength in mmn,126130 but large clinical trials have not compared the efficacy of scig versus ivig . 
 scig may have advantages over ivig , including the ability to maintain igg levels at a higher steady - state81,85,86 and perhaps smooth out  end - of - dose weakness  . 
 an mmn patient who had cyclic fluctuations in disability while receiving ivig every 34 weeks for 10 years provides a provocative example . switching to weekly scig and increasing 
 the total monthly dose by 25% resulted in increased strength , which was stable at the peak he had previously achieved only transiently after each ivig dose.128 this improvement was accompanied by an increase in the trough serum igg level from 1,500 mg / dl to a steady state of 2,100 mg / dl , consistent with the hypothesis that the patient 's strength at any point in time is directly related to the total igg concentration of in his circulation.128 similar dose - dependency observations were reported in small prospective , open - label , noncontrolled trials in which 4 of 5 patients maintained stable mrc sum scores for at least 6 months with steady - state serum igg levels of 1,380 to 1,740 mg / dl.129,130 taken together , these results suggest that scig may be a useful alternative to ivig for some mmn patients , particularly those that experience treatment - related  wear - off  or 
 there remains a controversy as to whether prolonged ivig treatment totally controls the progression of mmn , or whether axonal degeneration and long term deterioration are inevitable . 
 some studies suggest that careful optimization of therapy with frequent adjustments to avoid end - of - dose weakening may help promote long - term recovery and prevent axonal loss,124 although other reports suggest gradual worsening despite this approach.75 it may be that axon damage increases toward the end of each dosing interval , when the ratio of the putative autoantibodies to normal igg is relatively high and the patient is experiencing increased weakness . if that is the case , using scig to maintain higher steady - state igg levels without cyclic troughs may decrease long - term deterioration in mmn , but that hypothesis remains to be tested . 
 in 2007 , the peripheral neuropathy outcome measures standardization ( perinoms ) study began.131 a major aim of this international collaboration is to better define the metrics used to follow patients with inflammatory neuropathies . in 2013 , 
 the group analyzed outcome measure data collected from cross - sectional validity and reliability studies as well as longitudinal studies of responses.132 the results emphasized the importance of measuring disability ( i.e. , activities and participation ) , strength and sensory impairment , and quality of life . 
 disability measured by the rasch - built overall disability scale ( r - ods),133 impairment measured by grip strength ( martin vigorimeter),103 and quality of life measured by the short form-36 item health survey134 emerged as useful metrics by which cidp patients can be assessed and treatment responses can be better defined . although the use of these kinds of assessments has typically been limited to clinical trials , these measures ( especially r - ods and grip strength ) can be performed very quickly and reliably and , if validated , may greatly facilitate routine clinical care . 
 we propose that frequent collection of validated and reliable disease - specific measures between physician visits can be used to optimize clinical care and improve outcomes . 
 of course , continued assessment of symptoms and signs by interviewing and examining the patient during office visits is invaluable and irreplaceable . 
 defining the treatment response during relatively brief , intermittent office visits may be difficult and not representative of the patient 's function in his / her home environment . 
 what about pain , fatigue , and/or other subjective symptoms in the absence of clear indicators of disease activity ? 
 which factors should drive the treatment plan ? for the patient who demonstrates some improvement , how do we know that therapy has been maximized ? 
 these treatment challenges are further magnified by the limited frequency with which a comprehensive examination and interview can be achieved , especially with current economic pressures . 
 one approach to treatment optimization is frequent collection of disease - specific outcome measures like grip strength and r - ods as discussed within perinoms . 
 ivig regimens offer a unique opportunity to perform such assessments at the time of the infusions . 
 if a patient achieves only a partial peak response and/or reports wear - off , the ivig dose and frequency can be optimized with rapid confirmation of the desired effect . on the other hand 
 , this type of monitoring can also be useful to identify patients who fail to respond or who no longer need ivig . 
 the dose can then be tapered or the interval between infusions lengthened with the security of frequently obtained reliable measures in case of relapse . 
 use of these metrics can help establish drug efficacy in individual cases , provide a rationale for patient - specific treatment tailoring , and allow rapid detection of nonresponders . 
 the importance of these metrics in clinical trials is obvious , but their long - term utility has yet to be studied . extending their application to routine clinical care may offer a unique opportunity to optimize inflammatory neuropathy treatment paradigms and hopefully long term outcomes . 
 many investigators are actively seeking an immunologic biomarker or soluble indicator of neuronal damage which could be used to identify those patients who are most likely to respond to igg therapy and to monitor its effects in mmn , cidp and other neuropathies.33,62,64,90,95,96,122 in the absence of such biomarkers , frequent measurements of grip strength and of disability using r - ods may be used to better characterize treatment responses . 
 current treatment strategies rely heavily on data obtained through unstructured and often unsolicited communication from patients as well as from infrequent face - to - face office visits . 
 adherence to rigorous diagnostic standards3,53,62,68,122,123 and collection of focused disease - specific outcome measures at more frequent intervals may assist with development of better paradigms for optimizing treatment . 
 prompt recognition of those patients for whom igg or other expensive biologicals are unnecessary or ineffective is another likely benefit of frequent measurements , which may aid in the development of criteria for identifying nonresponders and selecting appropriate alternatives , . 
 although several recent reports suggest that dosing ivig as frequently as every 714 days , or the use of scig to maintain high steady - state igg levels may be preferable in terms of maintaining consistent function and minimizing disability , several questions remain unanswered . 
 importantly , analyses of larger and more diverse populations are needed to determine which patients are characterized by a predominance of functional immunologic effects that are rapidly and reversibly responsive to igg and/or other immunotherapies as opposed to those who have mainly structural and/or permanent damage . similarly , 
 longer term follow - up is necessary to determine whether the kinetics of responsiveness vary at different stages of disease , and whether minimizing short - term fluctuations in strength and/or disability correlates with long term outcomes . 
 immunologic as well as clinical studies suggest that cidp is a heterogeneous group of conditions with a multiplicity of immunologic targets and mediators . 
 the kinetics and pattern of response to igg and other therapies may be a useful criterion according to which subsets of these diseases are classified and split - out for further studies . because igg can act by many different mechanisms , it seems quite likely that better definition of the immunopathogenesis of particular disease subtypes might lead to preferential use of different therapies , such as steroids and anti - inflammatories , complement inhibitors , or monoclonal antibodies and other narrowly targeted biologicals . in conclusion , recent studies of the immunology and electrophysiology of cidp and mmn suggest that much of the morbidity and disability in these conditions is caused by readily reversible functional effects of autoantibodies rather than more slowly repairable structural damage.18,21 these results serve as a foundation for understanding clinical observations of rapid responses and  wear - off  effects with intermittent ivig bolus therapy . together , these observations suggest the hypothesis that infused antibodies in igg actually compete with pathologic autoantibodies . 
 observations that dosing of ivig as often as every 710 days or the use of scig to continuously maintain high steady - state igg levels may be preferable to the periodic extremely high peaks and low troughs of ivig boluses given every 46 weeks . giving smaller doses of ivig more frequently or routine weekly self - administration of scig in the home may be associated with fewer , less severe adverse effects and significant cost savings as compared to intermittent high dose ivig , which requires administration and monitoring by a trained nurse , even if given at home . 
 additional research is needed to determine how widely applicable frequent dosing of ivig or scig might be , and whether continuous maintenance of optimal strength / minimal disability is associated with better long - term outcomes . 
 this can only be achieved with the use of frequent monitoring of patients ' responses and periodic re - assessments of therapeutic efficacy .

 recent studies of the electrophysiology and immunology of these diseases suggest that antibody - induced reversible dysfunction of nodes of ranvier may play a role in conduction block and disability which responds to immunotherapy more rapidly than would be expected for demyelination or axonal damage per se . 
 clinical reports suggest that in some cases , the effects of each dose of ivig may be transient , wearing - off before the next dose is due . 
 these observations lead us to hypothesize that that therapeutic igg acts by competing with pathologic autoantibodies and that individual patients may require different igg levels for optimal therapeutic effects . 
 frequent ivig dosing and weekly subcutaneous igg have been tried as ways of continuously maintaining high serum igg levels , resulting in stabilization of neuromuscular function in small case series . 
 frequent grip strength and disability measurements , performed by the patient at home and reported electronically , can be used to assess the extent and duration of responses to igg doses . 
 individualization of igg treatment regimens may optimize efficacy , minimize disability , and identify nonresponders .

"neurological soft signs ( nss ) have long been considered one of the functional features ( tsuang and faraone , 1999 ; tsuang et al . , 1991 ) and endophenotypes ( chan and gottesman , 2008 ; chan et al . , 2010a ) of schizophrenia spectrum disorders . 
 however , most of the studies of nss have been limited to the use of clinical ratings . instead 
 , recent findings from both structural and functional imaging studies have shown that nss may be associated with specific brain alterations . 
 specifically , in individuals with psychosis , more nss have been associated with smaller volumes of the inferior frontal lobes ( thomann et al . , 2009a ) , the pre - central gyrus ( heuser et al . , 2011 ; mouchet - mages et al . , 2011 
 ) , the global cortical sulci ( dazzan et al . , 2004 ; gay et al . , 
 2013 ) as well as the cerebellum ( ho et al . , 2004 ; thomann et al . 
 , nss may be responsible for some of the observed clinical manifestations in schizophrenia ( keshavan et al . 
 , 2003 ; mouchet - mages et al . , 2011 ; schroder et al . , 1999 ) . 
 a recent meta - analysis of structural and functional imaging findings suggests that nss are associated with volume reductions of the pre - central gyrus , the cerebellum , the inferior frontal gyrus and the thalamus . 
 furthermore , the same meta - analysis also suggests that functional imaging studies support an association between nss and altered neural activation in the inferior frontal gyrus , the bilateral putamen , the cerebellum and the superior temporal gyrus in patients with schizophrenia ( zhao et al . , 
 , these findings support the presence of a dysfunction of neural circuitry that underlies the presence of these minor neurological abnormalities , which are already present at illness onset . on the other hand , empirical findings 
 have also shown that non - psychotic first - degree relatives of schizophrenia patients exhibit a higher prevalence of nss compared to healthy controls ( egan et al . 
 a meta - analysis comparing the prevalence of nss between patients with schizophrenia , non - psychotic first - degree relatives and healthy controls indicated a mean effect size of 0.8 and 0.97 for patients and their non - psychotic first - degree relatives and for non - psychotic first - degree relatives and controls respectively ( chan et al . , 2010b ) . 
 these results are consistent with the argument that nss are familial in nature and segregate with the illness . 
 however , no studies had examined the brain correlates of nss in healthy relatives of patients with schizophrenia . 
 furthermore , all the aforementioned neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia patients used conventional subtraction analysis and did not examine the underlying connectivity between the brain regions identified . given that some nss , such as the fist 
 palm ( fep ) task ( first described by luria , see heuser et al . , 2011 ) , involve the functional integration or regulation of areas involved in motor sequencing rather than being directly activated , a connectivity approach is more appropriate to identify the specific network involved . 
 only one study ( rao et al . , 2008 ) adopted a psychophysiological interaction ( ppi ) ( friston et al . , 1997 ) method to re - analyze their previous findings on the fep task in healthy volunteers ( chan et al . , 2006 ) . 
 this new analysis showed enhanced functional connectivities between the left- and right sensorimotor cortices ( smc ) and the right inferior and middle prefrontal cortices during fep task performance compared to a simple palming task . 
 these findings suggest a regulatory role of the prefrontal cortex on fep task execution . in this study 
 , we examined whether prefrontal regions are involved in the integration or regulation of neural activity underlying motor sequencing in patients with first - episode schizophrenia and their non - psychotic first degree relatives ( fdr ) . 
 more specifically , we aimed to identify any frontal regions where coupling in these areas and the sensorimotor cortex ( smc ) significantly differed between the complex fep task and a simple control motor task using ppi analysis . 
 we hypothesized that patients with first - episode schizophrenia and their non - psychotic fdrs would show a reduced dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex and smc while performing the fep task . 
 thirteen right - handed first - episode schizophrenia patients were recruited from the mental health center , peking university , beijing , for the study . 
 participants were recruited to the study if they met the following inclusion criteria : a ) diagnosis of schizophrenia ascertained by experienced psychiatrists according to the dsm - iv ( apa , 1994 ) ; b ) aged 1840  years ; and c ) illness duration within 2  years . 
 the exclusion criteria were : a ) a history of neurological disorders ; b ) a lifetime history of substance abuse and c ) an estimated iq lower than 70 . 
 current symptom severity was assessed with the positive and negative syndrome scale ( kay et al . , 1987 ) . 
 fourteen non - psychotic fdrs of the patients taking part in the study were also invited to participate . 
 potential participants were excluded if they a ) met the dsm - iv criteria for substance abuse ; b ) were suffering from any clinically unstable medical disorder ; c ) had a history of head injury ( past or present ) ; and d ) had an estimated iq lower than 70 . 
 fourteen healthy controls matched with the patients in age , gender and handedness were recruited from local universities through advertisements . 
 the institutional review board of the institute of psychology , the chinese academy of sciences , approved the study protocol . 
 behavioral neurological soft signs were examined with the abridged version of the cambridge neurological inventory ( cni ) ( chan et al . , 2009 ) . 
 this abridged version offers instructions for eliciting and rating a comprehensive range of nss in motor coordination , sensory integration and disinhibition . 
 rao et al . , 2008 ) ( for the earliest description , please see luria , 1966 ; in heuser et al . , 2011 ) . in brief , the task consisted of three right - hand motor tasks which varied in complexity . in the simple palm tapping ( pt ) task 
 , participants were required to repeat only one right palm tapping in the prone position . in the intermediate complex pronation / supination ( ps ) task , participants were required to perform right palm tapping in the prone and supine positions alternatively . in the complex fep task , participants were required to successivley place their right hand in a fist resting position vertically ( fist ) , a palm resting position vertically ( edge ) , and a palm resting position horizontally ( palm ) . a resting condition ( a ) without any hand movement when participants were asked to focus on the screen 
 was used as the control baseline of the pt task , and the pt task was in turn used as the control baseline of the ps and fep tasks . 
 participants were asked to practice the motor actions correctly at a constant rate before entering the scanner . during scanning , their performance was monitored by the experimenter through the window of the scanner room . in the formal imaging task 
 , participants were instructed to perform the three tasks at a similar pace throughout the entire experiment . 
 pt and ps tasks were executed in 1  s and the fep task was executed in 1.5  s. the experimenter monitored the task performance outside the scanner room to ensure that the participants performed the correct hand movements . 
 first , a resting condition lasted for 20  s and then 6  s of counting backward reminded the participants to get ready for their hand movement . after backward counting , the pt or ps or fep task lasted for 40  s. one of these three hand movements would be presented on the screen . 
 participants were required to conduct the hand movements according to the demonstration on the screen . 
 the sequence of the three hand movement tasks was optimized and counterbalanced within the three runs . 
 the functional imaging data was originally acquired in a ge 3  t sigma scanner ( general electric , waukesha , wi , usa ) with a standard ge birdcage - type rf coil using a standard t2 * -weighted epi sequence . 
 the epi parameters were : tr  =  2  s te  =  60  ms , fov  =  24    24  cm , matrix  =  64    64 , flip angle  =  60 , 22 axial slices ( 5  mm thick/1.2  mm sp , from superior to inferior ) . 
 the spatial resolution for the functional images was 3.75    3.75    6.2  mm . 
 high - resolution anatomical images were also obtained using the standard t1-weighted sequence ( 66 axial slices , 2.0  mm thick / interleaved , fov  =  24    24  cm , matrix  =  256    256 ) . 
 images were analyzed with statistical parametric mapping software ( spm8 , wellcome department of imaging neuroscience , london , uk ) implemented in matlab 2009b ( mathworks inc . 
 , sherborn , ma , usa ) . three dummy scans in the beginning of the experiment were removed automatically from the dataset . 
 images were registered to the first icbm 152 , which was based on 152 brains and was created by the montreal neurological institute ( mni ) with a 2    2    2  mm resolution . in the final step of pre - processing , the images were spatially smoothed by an isotropic gaussian kernel with fwhm of 8  mm . 
 conventional analyses were first conducted at the individual - level using voxel - wise general linear modeling ( glm ) and four t - contrasts were defined between the tasks and the corresponding baselines , i.e. , pt vs. rest , ps vs. rest , fep vs. rest and fep vs. pt . 
 data from the contrasts of the first level model in the healthy control group , the schizophrenia group and the fdr group were entered into this model . a threshold of alphasim corrected p  <  0.01 and cluster size larger than 15  voxels were used to identify the activations associated with each contrast . furthermore , we used a regression model to find the regions with group difference . 
 we set up an f contrast to find the regions with main effect of group difference . 
 signal change percentage was retrieved from the rois with group difference for post - hoc analysis . 
 ppi analysis was used to estimate functional integration during task execution under different motor complexity conditions . 
 the left smc was determined a - priori as the reference region for the ppi analysis because the motor tasks in the present study were only completed with the right hand . 
 this region was defined by using a sphere with a radius of 8  mm and a center at the peak activation in the left smc activation ( mni coordinates  =  [ 36 28 52 ] , from the conventional analysis of the contrast of pt vs. rest ) . 
 we performed voxel - wise ppi analysis at individual - level for the left smc to see if any other brain areas connected to the smc showed a significant increase in functional coupling ( the slope of regression ) during the fep task compared with a control task ( e.g. , the pt or ps task ) . 
 for each participant , the activation time course signal in the reference region ( i.e. , the first eigenvariate time series , adjusted by effect of interest ) was extracted from the conventional glm and entered into the ppi analysis as the first regressor representing the physiological variable . 
 a second regressor representing the motor tasks with different complexity was entered into the ppi analysis as the psychological variable . 
 the psychophysiological interaction between task complexity and activation signal in the reference region was designated as the regressor of interest in the ppi analysis . 
 thereafter we performed group - level random effect analysis on the individual results using one sample t - tests for the contrast fep vs. pt . 
 group - level paired t - tests were conducted for the contrast fep vs. ps . 
 areas of significant activation were identified at a threshold of uncorrected p  <  0.001 and cluster size larger than 15  voxels . 
 there was no significant difference between patients with schizophrenia , their fdrs and healthy controls in the three subscales and total score of cni . 
 conventional activation of the pt , ps and fep tasks in the three groups , after co - varying for age , is shown in table 3 . 
 the left frontal parietal region was significantly activated when participants performed the pt , ps and fep tasks with their right hand . moreover , in the pt  rest contrast , activation in the left frontal parietal region , together with the left medial frontal region , were lowest in patients with schizophrenia , intermediate in the fdrs and highest in healthy controls ( scz  <  rel  <  hc ) . 
 we further used a regression model and conducted a post - hoc analysis to identify the regions that were different across groups both linearly and non - linearly . in the pt  rest contrast , we confirmed that the left frontal precentral gyrus ( 30 34 64 , k  =  100 , f(2,37 )  =  20.23 ) was linearly activated in all three groups ( scz  <  rel  <  hc ) . 
 the left medial frontal region ( hc  =  rel  >  scz , 8 18 64 , k  =  136 , f(2,37 )  =  15.59 ) and the left middle temporal gyrus ( hc  >  scz  =  rel , 48 68 10 , k  =  124 , f(2,37 )  =  11.7 ) were non - linearly activated in all three groups . 
 the activations associated with task complexity were examined in the fep  ps and the fep  pt contrasts . in the fep 
 pt contrast , the bilateral middle frontal regions were activated in the healthy control group . 
 the left middle frontal region was activated in the fdr group , but there was no frontal region activation in first episode schizophrenia patients . 
 2 illustrates the frontal activation in both healthy controls and fdrs . in the fep 
 ps contrast , the left middle frontal region was also activated in the fdr group , but not in the healthy control group or the schizophrenia group . 
 the ppi analysis identified right frontal regions in which the activity showed significant activation coupling to activity in the left smc during performance of the more complex fep task relative to the simple pt or ps tasks in the healthy control group , but not in the schizophrenia group . 
 in this study , we report for the first time the neural activation and connectivity elicited by execution of the fep task in patients with first episode schizophrenia and their healthy first degree relatives . 
 our main finding is that patients with first episode schizophrenia do not show , in comparison with healthy controls and their fdrs , activation of the left middle frontal gyrus in the execution of the fep versus a simpler motor task like the pt . 
 this provides evidence of a frontal dysfunction in these patients when performing a complex motor task . 
 the right inferior frontal gyrus was found to modulate the activation of the sensorimotor cortex with the increase in motor complexity in healthy controls . 
 a frontal dysfunction was also demonstrated by our second main finding , suggesting that with increase in task difficulty , patients with first episode schizophrenia do not show functional connectivity between the sensorimotor cortex and the right frontal gyrus , in contrast to healthy controls . 
 the presence of a prefrontal dysfunction in schizophrenia is supported by extensive evidence from both structural and functional neuroimaging studies . 
 prefrontal areas have been consistently reported as reduced in volume in patients with schizophrenia ( chan et al . , 2011 ; dazzan et al . , 
 furthermore , fmri studies have shown altered activation of frontal areas during executive and working memory tasks , particularly with increasing capacity demand ( barch et al . 
 , 2012 ; callicott et al . , 2000 ; perry et al . , 2001 ) . at a functional level 
 , patients with schizophrenia also show an excess of signs reflecting frontal release , such as abnormalities in eye movements and short - term memory deficits , which again point to a frontal cortical alteration ( hyde et al . , 2007 ) . 
 in this study , we tested the activation of frontal areas during a complex motor task , the fep task , which has long been considered in neurological and neurocognitive studies as indicative of frontal lobe lesions ( luria , 1966 ) . 
 two previous fmri studies have reported that in healthy individuals , the execution of this task did not induce activation of prefrontal areas , but induced activation of other parts of the cortex , including the sensorimotor areas ( chan et al . , 2006 ; umetsu et al . , 2002 ) . 
 a subsequent study , using the same ppi approach that we used in this study , showed that this finding could reflect an indirect involvement of the prefrontal cortex , which could exert an integrative and regulatory function on neural circuitry involved in complex motor sequences . 
 we found here that in healthy individuals , the execution of the fep task , compared to a simpler motor act , was indeed associated with both direct activation of the prefrontal cortex , and greater coupling of prefrontal areas and sensorimotor cortex . 
 interestingly , a recent meta - analysis of the brain connectome suggests that the frontal lobe represents a hub ( a region highly interconnected with other brain regions and valuable for integrative information processing and adaptive behavior ) particularly affected in patients with schizophrenia ( crossley et al . , 2014 ) . there is a paucity of studies on brain activation during complex motor tasks in these patients . 
 however , neuroimaging studies that examined gross motor coordination signs such as finger - to - thumb operation tests in these patients have reported reduced activation in the smc and the supplementary motor area ( sma ) in comparison to healthy controls ( schrder et al . , 
 a later similar study used pronation / supination tests and found significant reduced activation in the smc in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls ( schroder et al . , 1999 ) . 
 the lack of activation we found with a task like the fep , which requires fine motor coordination and requires executive processes like inhibition , planning and updating , could be interpreted as part of the hypofrontality hypothesis of schizophrenia reflecting a reduced function of the prefrontal cortex ( callicott et al . , 2000 ) . 
 response relationship of the left frontal parietal activation across patients , their fdrs and healthy controls . here , in the pt vs. rest 
 contrast , activation was lowest in the schizophrenia group , intermediate in the fdr group and highest in the healthy control group . although these differences were highlighted with a motor sequence less complex than the fep , the finding suggests that at least part of the pathophysiological substrate that underlies motor difficulties in psychosis may be linked to a genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia . 
 indeed , deficits in motor skills have been reported extensively in individuals at risk of schizophrenia because of either genetic loading or prodromal features ( blanchard et al . , 2010 ; 
 first , the clinical sample size was relatively small . however , the merit of the present sample is that it included both first - episode schizophrenia patients and their non - psychotic siblings . 
 secondly , the use of ppi analysis may not fully detect the connectivity changes related to the performance of the fep task . 
 however , ppi is an appropriate method to test the relationship between two simple mental activities ( friston et al . , 1997 ) . 
 other more sophisticated approaches , such as dynamic casual modeling , may help identify further subtle connectivity changes in the performance of the fep task . 
 thirdly , the use of the screen to synchronize the motor actions might induce the activation of mirror neurons . 
 however , the contrasts between any two of the three motor actions ( fep , pt , and ps ) should minimize this effect by subtraction methods . 
 finally , we should also consider the validity of our task , since previous subtraction analyses of the fep task did not elicit activation of the frontal cortex . 
 however , the fact that the left frontal parietal region was significantly activated when participants performed the pt , ps and fep tasks with their right hand suggests that this hand movement imaging task was valid . notwithstanding these limitations 
 , our findings suggest that the fep task may be a useful endophenotype of schizophrenia , as it fulfills the criteria of being familial and shows a dose 
 previous study had demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia showed aberrant brain activation in the premotor area after a week of motor training ( kodama et al . 
 , 2001 ) . given this temporal stability of nss , the fact that this is an imaging endophenotype rather than a simple behavioral rating arguably enhances its precision . 
 this task is also simpler to carry out when compared to a full nss scale . 
 we believe that our findings add valuable information to the understanding of the origin and underlying neural mechanism of motor coordination signs . 
 future studies should recruit a larger sample of first - episode , preferably medication - nave schizophrenia patients for further validation of our findings .","furthermore meta analysis also suggests functional imaging studies support association nss altered neural activation inferior frontal gyrus bilateral putamen cerebellum superior temporal gyrus patients schizophrenia zhao et al

 most previous studies have employed clinical rating data only . the present study aimed to examine the neurobiological basis of one of the typical motor coordination signs , the fist  edge 
 palm ( fep ) task , in patients with first - episode schizophrenia and their non - psychotic first degree relatives . 
 thirteen patients with first - episode schizophrenia , 14 non - psychotic first - degree relatives and 14 healthy controls were recruited . 
 all of them were instructed to perform the fep task in a 3  t ge machine . 
 psychophysiological interaction ( ppi ) analysis was used to evaluate the functional connectivity between the sensorimotor cortex and frontal regions when participants performed the fep task compared to simple motor tasks . in the contrast of palm - tapping ( pt ) vs. rest , activation of the left frontal 
 parietal region was lowest in the schizophrenia group , intermediate in the relative group and highest in the healthy control group . 
 in the contrast of fep vs. pt , patients with schizophrenia did not show areas of significant activation , while relatives and healthy controls showed significant activation of the left middle frontal gyrus . 
 moreover , with the increase in task complexity , significant functional connectivity was observed between the sensorimotor cortex and the right frontal gyrus in healthy controls but not in patients with first episode schizophrenia . 
 these findings suggest that activity of the left frontal  parietal and frontal regions may be neurofunctional correlates of neurological soft signs , which in turn may be a potential endophenotype of schizophrenia . moreover , the right frontal gyrus may play a specific role in the execution of the fep task in schizophrenia spectrum disorders ."
"kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients who suffer end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) . 
 survival and quality of life in renal transplant recipients are more than in dialysis patients ( 1 , 2 ) . 
 unfortunately , organ availability for kidney transplantation is restricted by the growing number of patients waiting for this treatment ( 3 ) . 
 additionally , several complications occur after kidney transplantation , including surgical complications ( e.g. fluid collections , urinoma , lymphocele , hematoma , and abscess ) , incisional hernia , acute kidney injury , infections and allograft rejection ( 4 ) . among these complications , 
 the management of acute rejection is very important , because each rejection that is not controlled will destroy the allograft and increase patient s morbidity and mortality ( 2 ) . 
 there are two international classications for acute allograft rejection : t cell - mediated acute rejection and antibody - mediated acute rejection ( amr ) . 
 t cell - mediated acute rejection was more studied than amr over the past several years . 
 the use of potent immunosuppressive agents has greatly reduced the rate of acute cellular rejection . 
 consequently , the 1-year graft survival has significantly improved , following kidney transplantation . in recent years , 
 acute and chronic amr are playing serious roles in kidney allograft loss and are considered as important causes that limit long - term outcomes of kidney transplantation ( 2 , 5 , 6 ) . within the few days after kidney transplantation , early acute amr occurs in transplant recipients with anti - hla or donor specific antibodies ( dsa ) ( 7 ) . rejection phenotypes and outcomes are more complex in clinical practice than in the theory . 
 rejection can be diagnosed by renal biopsy findings , such as c4d deposition in the peritubular capillaries and histological features of inammation , allograft dysfunction , and serologic evidence of circulating antibodies ( 2 ) . despite signicant advances in recent years 
 several differential diagnoses have to be considered when amr is suspicious , which include acute ischemic injury , acute calcineurin inhibitor ( cni ) toxicity , infections and thrombotic microangiopathy ( tma ) . 
 the tma is always the most important differential diagnosis of amr ( 8) . the gold standard for exact diagnosis is renal biopsy ( 9 ) ; however , in many patients , performing kidney biopsy is not feasible due to the patient s low platelet count and lack of personal satisfaction . in these situations , 
 this study was designed to assess the efficacy of routine treatment of amr / tma in iranian kidney transplant recipients , comprising of plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) . 
 this 1-year cross - sectional study was performed at the kidney transplantation ward of imam - khomeini hospital complex , affiliated to tehran university of medical sciences , tehran , iran from 1st january 2014 . 
 all kidney transplant recipients , who were administered plasmapheresis and ivig to treat definite or suggested amr or tma , were assessed . 
 all patients in this transplant ward receive rabbit antithymocyte globulin ( ratg ) , as induction therapy , with a cumulative dose of at least 6 mg / kg . 
 they are also administered methylprednisolone 500 mg on the transplantation day and 250 and 125 mg on the next two days after transplantation , which is continued with oral prednisolone 1 
 mg / kg / day , with rapid taper down during the next days , to reach the dose of 5 mg / day after month one from transplantation . 
 they also receive a cni ( mostly tacrolimus ) and mycophenolate mofetil as maintenance immunosuppressive regimen . 
 all patients receive intravenous ganciclovir / oral valganciclovir , oral co - trimoxazole and clotrimazole for routine viral , pneumocystis pneumonia , and fungal prophylaxis . 
 patients demographic and clinical data ( sex , age , weight , height , cause of esrd ) , laboratory findings ( including serum creatinine and urea concentrations , urine volume , serum electrolytes , complete blood counts and serum lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) concentration ) , were gathered in designed forms .

 five kidney transplant patients were treated for suspicious / definite amr or tma during the year 2014 at this center . 
 the patient s.t . , a 56-year - old female , with a history of esrd with undiagnosed cause , was admitted in february 2014 for a second renal transplantation . she had a history of renal transplant with hyperacute rejection 6 years ago . 
 her creatinine was decreased from 5.6 to 0.9 mg / dl , within 5 days after transplantation ; however , on day 6 after transplantation , her urine output was significantly decreased and her serum creatinine level rose . 
 our concern regarded the tma and possibility of acute rejection , although we were unable to perform allograft biopsy , because of her low platelet count . 
 g / kg ideal body weight , for 5 days , which is equal to approximately 460 mg / kg / day . 
 concomitant with ivig therapy , plasmapheresis was performed daily for four sessions and thereafter , every other day , for three sessions . 
 the ivig doses were infused after plasmapheresis treatment . due to lack of improvement in kidney function and platelet count , tacrolimus was stopped 16 days after transplantation . 
 treatment with plasmapheresis and ivig was not effective in this patient and therefore was discontinued . 
 due to uncontrolled fever and patient s illness , nephrectomy was performed in her case . 
 , a 15-year - old male , with a history of esrd of unknown origin , was admitted in may 2014 for preemptive kidney transplantation from a 14-year - old deceased male . 
 although his diethylene triamine pentacaetic acid ( dtpa ) radionuclide scan suggested acute rejection , renal biopsy could not be performed . 
 plasmapheresis and high - dose of ivig ( 2 g / kg ) were prescribed 2 days after transplantation . 
 he was treated with plasmapheresis for 9 consecutive days and his ivig was divided to these 9 days after each plasmapheresis session ( i.e. about 222 mg / kg after each plasmapheresis ) . 
 he was discharged from the hospital with a serum creatinine level similar to his pretransplant value . 
 , a 40-year - old male , with a history of esrd with undetermined origin , was admitted in june 2014 . 
 his maintenance regimen included tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone . during the first few days he showed good allograft functioning . however , 3 days after transplantation , serum ldh level increased and platelet count decreased significantly . 
 four days after plasmapheresis initiation , ldh decreased and platelet count increased . at day 18 from transplantation , his serum creatinine concentration increased from 1.5 mg / dl to 1.9 and 2.4 mg / dl , during two days . therefore , his plasmapheresis was continued additionally for four sessions every other day and 1.5 g / kg of ivig was divided to four doses ( 375 mg / kg each ) on the days that patient did not undergo plasmapheresis . after this treatment , his creatinine 
 , a 44-year - old male with a history of esrd with undetermined origin , was admitted in september 2014 and received the kidney from a 37-year - old deceased female . 
 his first renal biopsy , which was performed 5 days after transplantation , showed c4d deposition in peritubular capillaries . 
 plasmapheresis was performed daily for 5 days and every other day , for five additional sessions . 
 the ivig with a cumulative dose of 2.1 g / kg was administered during 8 consecutive days ( i.e. about 263 mg / kg each day ) , starting the day before plasmapheresis initiation . however , there was no improvement in his renal function . 
 the second biopsy that was done 11 days after transplantation revealed necrosis and vascular congestion , associated with amr . because of no improvement in his renal function 
 , the third biopsy was done on day 16 after transplantation and showed more than 90% glomerular necrosis . 
 , a 57-year - old female with a history of esrd because of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease , was admitted in october 2014 . 
 the biopsy was performed at day 12 , showing glomerular basement membrane thickening and subendothelial widening that was compatible with tma . 
 after that , platelet count decreased from 100000 to 39000 cells / microliter and serum ldh level increased . therefore , she received methylprednisolone pulses for 3 days . 
 she received a cumulative dose of 2.3 g / kg ivig during 4 consecutive days ( i.e. about 383 mg / kg at each doses ) , started with plasmapheresis treatment . 
 plasmapheresis was performed for a cumulative 15 sessions , six of which were daily and the others every 2 - 3 days . 
 the patient s general condition was deteriorated and despite nephrectomy and antibiotic therapy , the patient unfortunately expired in a sepsis tableau . 
 the patient s.t . , a 56-year - old female , with a history of esrd with undiagnosed cause , was admitted in february 2014 for a second renal transplantation . 
 her creatinine was decreased from 5.6 to 0.9 mg / dl , within 5 days after transplantation ; however , on day 6 after transplantation , her urine output was significantly decreased and her serum creatinine level rose . 
 our concern regarded the tma and possibility of acute rejection , although we were unable to perform allograft biopsy , because of her low platelet count . 
 two days later , she received ivig , with a cumulative dose of 2.3 g / kg ideal body weight , for 5 days , which is equal to approximately 460 mg / kg / day . 
 concomitant with ivig therapy , plasmapheresis was performed daily for four sessions and thereafter , every other day , for three sessions . 
 the ivig doses were infused after plasmapheresis treatment . due to lack of improvement in kidney function and platelet count , 
 treatment with plasmapheresis and ivig was not effective in this patient and therefore was discontinued . 
 due to uncontrolled fever and patient s illness , nephrectomy was performed in her case . 
 , a 15-year - old male , with a history of esrd of unknown origin , was admitted in may 2014 for preemptive kidney transplantation from a 14-year - old deceased male . 
 although his diethylene triamine pentacaetic acid ( dtpa ) radionuclide scan suggested acute rejection , renal biopsy could not be performed . 
 plasmapheresis and high - dose of ivig ( 2 g / kg ) were prescribed 2 days after transplantation . 
 he was treated with plasmapheresis for 9 consecutive days and his ivig was divided to these 9 days after each plasmapheresis session ( i.e. about 222 mg / kg after each plasmapheresis ) . 
 he was discharged from the hospital with a serum creatinine level similar to his pretransplant value . 
 , a 40-year - old male , with a history of esrd with undetermined origin , was admitted in june 2014 . 
 his maintenance regimen included tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone . during the first few days he showed good allograft functioning . however , 3 days after transplantation , serum ldh level increased and platelet count decreased significantly . 
 four days after plasmapheresis initiation , ldh decreased and platelet count increased . at day 18 from transplantation , 
 his serum creatinine concentration increased from 1.5 mg / dl to 1.9 and 2.4 mg / dl , during two days . 
 therefore , his plasmapheresis was continued additionally for four sessions every other day and 1.5 g / kg of ivig was divided to four doses ( 375 mg / kg each ) on the days that patient did not undergo plasmapheresis . 
 after this treatment , his creatinine was decreased to 1.7 mg / dl and relative improvement occurred . 
 , a 44-year - old male with a history of esrd with undetermined origin , was admitted in september 2014 and received the kidney from a 37-year - old deceased female . 
 his first renal biopsy , which was performed 5 days after transplantation , showed c4d deposition in peritubular capillaries . 
 plasmapheresis was performed daily for 5 days and every other day , for five additional sessions . the ivig with a cumulative dose of 2.1 g / kg was administered during 8 consecutive days ( i.e. about 263 mg / kg each day ) , starting the day before plasmapheresis initiation . 
 the second biopsy that was done 11 days after transplantation revealed necrosis and vascular congestion , associated with amr . because of no improvement in his renal function , 
 the third biopsy was done on day 16 after transplantation and showed more than 90% glomerular necrosis . 
 the patient h.n . , a 57-year - old female with a history of esrd because of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease , was admitted in october 2014 . 
 the biopsy was performed at day 12 , showing glomerular basement membrane thickening and subendothelial widening that was compatible with tma . 
 after that , platelet count decreased from 100000 to 39000 cells / microliter and serum ldh level increased . 
 she received a cumulative dose of 2.3 g / kg ivig during 4 consecutive days ( i.e. about 383 mg / kg at each doses ) , started with plasmapheresis treatment . 
 plasmapheresis was performed for a cumulative 15 sessions , six of which were daily and the others every 2 - 3 days . the patient s general condition was deteriorated and despite nephrectomy and antibiotic therapy , the patient unfortunately expired in a sepsis tableau . 
 during recent years , the use of effective immunosuppressants resulted in the decrease of the rate of acute cellular rejection . 
 however , amr has become an important cause of graft loss during the initial weeks to months after transplantation ( 7 ) . 
 the incidence of acute graft loss in amr is greater than acute cellular rejection ( 7 ) . in patients with high levels of dsa 
 , the incidence of graft loss in the first month after transplantation may be as high as 40% , while this rate is less than 10% in patients with a negative dsa ( 7 , 10 ) . 
 early aggressive treatment of amr may be required to prevent graft loss ( 7 ) . 
 dehydration or elevated blood levels of cnis can also cause an increase in serum creatinine concentration . 
 although renal biopsy and measurement of the serum dsa are helpful , they are not always readily practical or available in the clinical settings ( 7 ) . performing renal biopsy 
 therefore , it is indicated to choose a treatment regimen that is helpful for both conditions . during year 2014 
 , we encountered five patients with suspicious amr or tma at our kidney transplant center . 
 renal biopsy was performed for two of them , suggesting amr in one patient and tma for the other . 
 therefore , we treated them with plasmapheresis plus ivig ; however , only one out of these five patients showed response albeit not completely . 
 the first strategy is to control b - cell activities by removal or dilution of antibodies . 
 we can use plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption for removal of antibodies . by administration of ivig , 
 the second option is to inhibit or deplete of b - cells using antibodies , such as rituximab , that act against cd20 in b - cells surface . 
 the third way is to reduce t - cells . diminished t - cells can decrease b - cell counts . 
 inhibitors of t - cell division ( mycophenolate mofetil and steroids ) , inhibitors of il-2 signaling to t - cells ( cnis ) , and t - cell depleting agents such as ratg are three options that decrease t - cells . a fourth target for the managing of amr 
 antibodies that are produced by plasma cell will become bound to graft and activate complement cascade . 
 therefore , the fth target that has recently been introduced is the xation of complement , which is activated by antibodies . 
 eculizumabis , a c5 inhibitor , is an option that reduces the dissemination of the complement cascade , even after antibodies have bound to the graft ( 1 , 6 , 11 ) . despite these various options for amr treatment , 
 there is no consensus over which treatment must be selected first in transplanted patients with amr ( 6 - 8 , 11 , 12 ) . 
 the importance of this issue is more apparent when we could not perform biopsy , as a gold standard for detecting amr . on the other hand , in several situations we could not distinguish between amr and tma , according to the clinical features 
 therefore , designing a useful treatment strategy that could be used in both amr and tma is very crucial . 
 nevertheless , the first line of therapy was not indicated by any study ( 7 , 11 ) . 
 the systematic review conducted by roberts et al . demonstrated that the optimal treatment for amr remains unknown . 
 they recommended a combination treatment for the management of amr that is associated with multiple pathophysiologic pathways . 
 this combination includes plasmapheresis , ivig , immunosuppressants , rituximab , bortezumib and eculizumab ( 13 ) . as seen 
 , this proposed strategy is too expensive to be applied for all patients with definite or possible amr . 
 the management of tma has also been reviewed in many studies . almost always , plasma exchange is the first line of tma treatment . 
 the use of corticosteroids is recommended in tma patients with neurological or cardiovascular involvement . with these therapies , there is still a high mortality rate of 10 - 20% and a high relapse rate , of approximately 20 - 50% . 
 the effectiveness of rituximab in decreasing tma relapse and hospitalization duration has been confirmed in a series of studies ( 14 - 18 ) . 
 a cohort study that has been performed by westwood et al . revealed that early administration of rituximab for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ttp ) ( within 3 days ) was associated with faster remission , fewer plasma exchange sessions and shorter duration of hospital stay ( 14 ) . 
 the efficacy and safety of rituximab in severe ttp was shown by froissart et al . in adults , who responded poorly to therapeutic plasma exchange . 
 one - year relapses and hospitalization duration were decreased in patients who were treated with rituximab , compared with historical controls , who were treated with plasmapheresis ( 18 ) . in the present study 
 , the effectiveness of plasmapheresis and ivig were investigated in iranian kidney transplant recipients , with suspicious / definite amr or tma . assessing donor specific antibody 
 kidney biopsy is not performed in patients with thrombocytopenia in most iranian kidney transplant wards , due to legal considerations and fear of bleeding and its ominous consequences . due to similar clinical and laboratory features of amr and tma , including increased serum creatinine concentration , decreased urine output and platelet count , and increased serum ldh levels , most clinicians consider both situations when selecting treatment . according to the high cost of rituximab and lack of iranian insurance coverage of rituximab by nephrologist s order , a limited number of patients can afford its cost . 
 therefore , rituximab can not be easily used as first option in these situations in kidney transplant patients , which determines iranian nephrologists to usually start amr or tma treatment with plasmapheresis plus ivig . applying these therapies in our patients cohort 
 showed that only one out of five patients ( 20% ) , showed only partial response to these treatments . 
 the amr and tma were confirmed only in two patients by biopsy ( each in one patient ) . according to the literature 
 , it seems better to start combination treatments for both amr and tma , with common regimen of plasmapheresis plus ivig , plus rituximab . 
 almost all patients with tma are at risk of relapse ( 19 , 20 ) . in transplanted patients 
 we aim to decrease the relapse rate , because each tma episode could result in graft failure ( 20 ) , and rituximab is the required agent ( 14 - 18 ) . 
 the time of initiation of ivig and plasmapheresis was different between our patients . according to the study by jodele et al . 
 ( 21 ) early plasmapheresis could be effective in ttp patients even with multiorgan damage . 
 therefore , the early use of plasmapheresis and rituximab are recommended in situation in which it is difficult to distinguish between tma and amr . 
 however , according to the high cost and lack of insurance coverage of rituximab for kidney transplant recipients , almost none of our patients could benefit from this drug . 
 another explanation for the high rate of treatment failure in our patients may be the ineffectiveness of ivig , possibly due to its removal by plasmapheresis . in most studies , 
 it is recommended to administer ivig with maintenance dose of 100 mg / kg after each plasmapheresis , and when plasmapheresis was stopped , the remaining dose of ivig , to a cumulative dose of 2 g / kg , could be administered once ( 11 ) . in our center , as a routine practice of nephrology attending that has reached to nephrology fellows as well , 
 the cumulative dose of 2 g / kg of ivig is divided into 300 - 400 mg / kg after each plasmapheresis . due to daily plasmapheresis within the first few days after amr or tma , this ivig administration approach may result in high amount of ivig withdrawal by plasmapheresis . 
 the ivig role in the treatment of amr is more complex than just diluting antibodies , as proposed in several studies ( 1 ) . 
 the ivig may induce b - cell apoptosis and modulates b - cell signaling ( 22 ) . 
 it also inhibits antibody binding to the allograft and complement activities , by unknown mechanisms ( 23 ) . 
 therefore , removing high amounts of ivig by plasmapheresis , without its replacement , due to not adding removed ivig to the cumulative dose , may explain our high rate of treatment failure . 
 due to a series of similarities in clinical and laboratory features of amr and tma in kidney transplant recipients , the unavailability of dsa assessment in iranian laboratories , high risk kidney biopsy in several patients , especially in those with thrombocytopenia , and delayed pathology reports of renal biopsy in several iranian kidney transplant centers , it seems reasonable to start amr and tma management concomitantly , in clinical situations . 
 it means that it is better to start plasmapheresis with ivig and rituximab . due to the lack of iranian insurance coverage of rituximab by nephrologist 
 s order and high cost of this drug , most patients are not able to afford its cost . based on these clinical limitations 
 our suggestion is to reduce ivig dose after each plasmapheresis to 100 mg / kg ( i.e. replacement dose ) to reach the cumulative dose of 2 g / kg . if plasmapheresis treatment is held sooner than the completion of ivig cumulative dose of 2 g / kg , the remaining dose can be administered during one injection .","also administered methylprednisolone mg transplantation day mg next two days transplantation continued oral prednisolone mg kg day rapid taper next days reach dose mg day month one transplantation

due daily plasmapheresis within first days amr tma ivig administration approach may result high amount ivig withdrawal plasmapheresis","background : antibody mediated rejection ( amr ) and thrombotic microangiopathy ( tma ) after kidney transplantation are difficult to differentiate most of the times and both play important roles in kidney allograft loss . 
 common treatment strategies of these two conditions include plasmapheresis , intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) and rituximab.objectives:this study was designed to assess the efficacy of routine treatment of amr / tma in iranian kidney transplant recipients , which comprises of plasmapheresis and ivig.patients and methods : this one - year cross - sectional study was performed in the kidney transplantation ward of imam - khomeini hospital complex , tehran , iran . 
 all kidney transplant recipients who were administered plasmapheresis and ivig to treat definite or suggested amr or tma were assessed clinically and also evaluated on laboratory data.results:during 2014 , we encountered five patients with suspicious amr or tma at our kidney transplant center . 
 renal biopsy was performed for two of them , suggesting amr for one patient and tma for another patient . 
 all patients were treated with plasmapheresis plus ivig . in this center , as a routine practice , the cumulative dose of 2 g / kg of ivig was divided to 300 - 400 mg / kg after each plasmapheresis . 
 only one out of the five patients showed response , albeit not completely.conclusions:due to daily plasmapheresis within the first several days after amr or tma , administering high amounts of the cumulative dose of ivig after plasmapheresis may result in high amounts of ivig withdrawal by plasmapheresis and response failure . 
 our suggestion is to reduce the ivig dose after each plasmapheresis to 100 mg / kg ( i.e. replacement dose ) to reach a cumulative dose of 2 g / kg . if plasmapheresis treatment is initiated sooner than the completion of the ivig cumulative dose of 2 g / kg , the remaining dose can be administered during one injection ."
"papillon - lefevre syndrome belongs to a heterogeneous group of skin diseases that are characterized by hyperkeratosis of palms and soles . 
 papillon - lefevre syndrome is inherited as an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and early loss of primary and permanent teeth . 
 papillon - lefevre syndrome differs from other types of palmoplantar keratoderma in its severe periodontopathy and premature loss of primary and permanent dentition . 
 papillon - lefevre syndrome was first described in 1924 by papillon m m and lefevre p in two siblings . 
 fifty percent of the patients with papillon - lefevre syndrome appear to have been derived from consanguineous marriages . 
 hart et al . , showed that mutations of cathepsin c gene are responsible for papillon - lefevre syndrome and a region of chromosomes ( 11q14 - 21 ) is responsible for this . 
 an 18-year - old boy reported to the department of periodontology and implant dentistry , bharati vidyapeeth university dental college and hospital , navi - mumbai for the treatment of generalized mobility of teeth and bleeding gums . 
 scaly skin lesions began to appear by third year of age , later fissures appeared on palms and soles . 
 intense itching was noted and skin lesions went on to involve fingers , knees and elbows . 
 patient showed bilateral hyperkeratosis of palms , soles , dorsal surface of fingers and knees [ figures 1 and 2 ] .

 papillon - lefevre syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and aggressive periodontitis . 
 skin lesions develop concurrently with oral lesions and may extend to dorsal surfaces of hands and feet . 
 another form of disease associated with palmoplantar keratosis and severe aggressive periodontitis has been named haim - munk syndrome . 
 it differs from papillon - lefevre syndrome in symptoms such as arachnodactyly , acroosterolysis and onychogryphosis . in papillon - lefevre syndrome 
 the permanent dentition starts to erupt at proper time , but around 8 - 9 years of age periodontal destruction is repeated in the same manner as in primary dentition . 
 all permanent teeth are usually lost before 14 - 16 years of age . in subjects with papillon - lefevre syndrome 
 the exact biochemical defect leading to periodontal disease is still unclear . in 1942 , wannenmacher suggested that papillon - lefevre syndrome was due to a combination of ecto and mesodermal malformations . 
 suggested that a functional imbalance of collagenolytic activity in the periodontal ligament was responsible for periodontitis in papillon - lefevre syndrome . in 1984 , vandyke suggested that neutrophils from an individual with papillon - lefevre syndrome exhibit decreased receptor affinity for chemotaxins such as formyl peptides . 
 papillon - lefevre syndrome is associated with myeloperoxide deficiency , low integrin expression , defective phagocytosis and chemotaxis . 
 hattab et al . , reported four cases of papillon - lefevre syndrome affecting two jordanian families with eight children . in all patients there was a relationship between increased severity of skin lesions and seasonal variations and intensified periodontal destruction . 
 lass et al . in three multiplex families , one ethiopian and two german , demonstrated linkage of papillon - lefevre syndrome with chromosome 11q13-q14 . 
 fischer et al . , conducted a primary genome wide search by homozygosity mapping in a large consanguineous family with four affected siblings . 
 toomes et al . , showed that in patients with papillon - lefevre syndrome gene for cathepsin c which lies in chromosome 11 had undergone mutation resulting in decreased cathepsin c production . 
 hart et al . , reported mutations in cathepsin c gene in patients with papillon - lefevre syndrome from five different countries . in conclusion , we have reported two cases of papillon - lefevre syndrome . 
 further studies in the field of microbiology and genetics are necessary to find the exact cause of periodontal destruction in such patients , so that best possible dental treatment can be rendered to them .

"this was a retrospective cohort study approved by our institutional review board as a quality improvement research . 
 the records of catheter days 1 year before the introduction of midlines ( group a : august 1 , 2011 , to july 31 , 2012 ) and catheter days of 1 year after the regular use of midlines ( group b : november 1 , 2012 , to october 31 , 2013 ) in the ventilator unit were collected ( table 1 ) . during the period from august 2012 to november 2012 
 , internal medicine residents and nursing staff underwent training on the use and insertion of midline catheters and their care . 
 this dedicated team was responsible for replacing cvcs by midlines as per our new practices . 
 the midlines that we used were powerwand ( access scientific , san diego , calif ) . before midline catheter , 
 patient days : number of days the patient was in the ventilator unit ; catheter days : number of days the patient had a central venous catheter and after midline catheter , patient days : number of days the patient was in the ventilator unit ; catheter days : number of days the patient had a midline catheter we chose this unit because it has a constant denominator of the number and type of patients . 
 most of the patients in this unit are ventilator dependent and being treated for problems such as health care  associated pneumonia , urinary tract infections , wound and pressure ulcer infections , or other long - term conditions requiring acute care that can not be administered at a nursing home facility . 
 the patients here have longer length of stay compared with other units and generally have difficult venous access . 
 the most common reason for cvc use in this unit is for difficult and long - term intravenous access . 
 indications of cvcs in these patients included antibiotic therapy , infusion therapy , diagnostic procedures , transfusions , and blood draws . 
 the department of infection control of the hospital reports all the clabsi per 1000 catheter days in the hospital , categorized by location and unit . 
 the number of clabsi during this period along with the type of bacteria and the date of culture was obtained from the microbiology department . 
 we compared the clabsi rates between group a and group b to see whether it decreased through the use of midlines in comparison with central lines . 
 we trained a team of residents for a period of 3 months in the insertion of ultrasound - guided midline catheters , which would replace cvcs by midline catheters whenever possible . 
 the same antiseptic precautions used in cvc catheter placements under ultrasound guidance were applied to the placement of midlines . 
 the policy for replacing the central lines included the following guidelines : any patient with a cvc in a femoral vein had their line removed and replaced by a midline catheter . 
 all patients who were not on an ionotropic agent or total parenteral nutrition had their cvc replaced by midlines . 
 a midline catheter replaced any cvc in place longer than a week . a patient on antibiotic therapy being sent to nursing home for further management received a midline catheter . 
 the total number of catheter days was compared with the rate of clabsi in the 2 groups . 
 catheter days were calculated as the number of central line catheters on the unit every day . 
 adding the total number of catheters on the unit per day and adding this daily number for the length of time of the study help calculate catheter days . 
 central line  associated bsi was reported as rate per 1000 catheter days and can be calculated as follows : ( total number of clabsi / total number of catheter days )  1000 . 
 we used a  test to compare the number of catheter days per patient days in the 2 groups as well as to compare infections based on the number of catheter days in each group ( table 2 ) . comparing the number of catheter days per patient days in the 2 groups , as well as comparing infections based on the number of catheter days in each group 
 there was a significant decrease in the total number of catheter days on the ventilator unit in group a from 2408 catheter days in the 1 year ( august 1 , 2011 , to july 31 , 2012 ) before the introduction of midline catheters to 1521 catheter days in group b in the following year ( november 1 , 2012 , to october 31 , 2013 ; p < 0.05 in both groups ) . 
 the total number of clabsi infections in these periods was also significantly decreased from 8 to 0 ( table 3 ) . 
 this calculates to 3.32 clabsi per 1000 catheter days and 0 clabsi per 1000 catheter days , respectively ( add  ) . 
 the number of inpatient days during these periods was 3058 and 2948 days ( table 4 and 5 ) . 
 continuation of the  test  test : observed frequency  test : expected ( theoretical ) frequency , asserted by the null hypothesis there were no bsis associated with midlines in this study . 
 the centers for disease control and prevention has put in place guidelines to reduce the incidence of clabsi . 
 these guidelines brought about by numerous studies for years have helped bring down the rate of clabsi . 
 these measures include the following : reducing the number of dwell days by removing catheters as early as possible ; reducing the use of central lines by using other means of venous access ; proper care and technique for cvcs ; maximum sterile barrier precautions during insertion ; use of chlorhexidine for skin disinfection before catheter insertion ; avoidance of the femoral insertion site ; and use of recommended insertion site dressing care practices . 
 prolonged dwell time has been shown to increase clabsi rates rapidly after 9 catheter days . 
 replacing central lines with midlines decreases the dwell time and also the total number of catheter days . 
 it may be argued that the decrease in the use of central lines and thereby reducing the number may be responsible in decreasing clabsi ; however , our denominator is constant for comparison . 
 the use of midlines reduces the use of and the dwell days for central lines , and with this study , we show that it can be a factor in reducing clabsi as well . 
 another study showed that clabsi rates were higher in patients who had central lines for longer than 7 days . in our study , by replacing central lines with midlines in patients , we essentially decreased risk factors such as dressing changes , catheter care , and duration of central line use . 
 a more obvious outcome is the decrease in use of central lines itself , causing a drop in the infection rates . 
 the fall in infection rate may be attributed to the fewer number of catheters in place for longer than 7 days . before the introduction of midlines , difficult intravenous access in these chronically ill patients mandated the use of central lines . 
 there are other complications of central lines , including inadvertent arterial puncture ( 3% ) , hemothorax , or pneumothorax ( 1%-2% ) . 
 central lines and picc lines require x - ray confirmation of tip placement , exposing the patient to radiation . 
 midlines have complications as well ; our most common problem was the loss or malfunction of the midline including extravasations in 2 patients . 
 the bsi rate of midlines in various studies has been reported to be between 0% and 0.9% . 
 the combination of better available products and the increasing use of ultrasound guidance for intravenous catheter placement has renewed interest in midline catheters 
 . some limitations of midline catheters are inability to use for vasopressors , total parenteral nutrition or when large peripheral veins are not available such as in amputates and patients with arteriovenous fistulas . 
 we conclude that the use of midline catheters to replace central lines for difficult intravenous access decreases the rate of clabsi in a ventilator unit in a community hospital .","midline catheter patient days number days patient ventilator unit catheter days number days patient central venous catheter midline catheter patient days number days patient ventilator unit catheter days number days patient midline catheter chose unit constant denominator number type patients

"antiphospholipid syndrome ( aps ) is an autoimmune disease characterized by thrombosis and morbidity , specifically in pregnancy , due to antiphospholipid antibodies . 
 about half of the cases of aps occur as a primary disorder , while the rest arise in association with other autoimmune diseases , such as systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) . some diseases , such as pulmonary thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension , 
 are known to be complicated by aps ; however , aps with pleural effusion is extremely rare . here , 
 we present a case of aps complicated by unilateral pleural effusion that responded well to oral corticosteroid therapy . 
 a 75-year - old japanese man was admitted to our hospital for spreading erythema on his trunk and extremities , as well as dyspnea . 
 one year prior to admission , he visited us with a 1-year history of erythema and purpura on his legs , accompanied by intermittent fever . 
 results of laboratory examinations for antiphospholipid antibodies , lupus anticoagulant ( using the phospholipid neutralization test ) , and anticardiolipin antibody had been positive 12 weeks apart . 
 in addition , he showed positive antinuclear antibody ( 1:80 , homogeneous pattern ) , but was negative for anti - dsdna antibody , anti - sm antibody , anti - rnp antibody , anti - ss - a antibody , anti - ss - b antibody , antitopoisomerase i antibody , and anticentromere antibody . 
 mpo - anca , pr3-anca , and cryoglobulin were negative . given the diagnosis of aps , we initiated combination therapy with aspirin ( 100 mg daily ) and warfarin ( target international normalized ratio , 2.03.0 ) , but the skin lesions continued to gradually worsen . 
 violaceous erythema , purpura , and pigmentation were widely noted on his trunk and extremities ( fig . 
 1 ) ; they were associated with low platelets ( 93,000/l ) and elevated partial thromboplastin time ( 48.4 s ) . 
 a biopsy specimen revealed marked thrombosis in the dermal and subcutaneous small vessels ( fig . 
 2 ) . there were interface changes of the dermo - epidermal junction and mild inflammatory infiltrates in the perivascular area of the dermis , but mucin deposition and thickening of the basal layer of the epidermis were not apparent . 
 in addition , a chest x - ray and computed tomography demonstrated a large pleural effusion in the left lung ( fig . 
 3 ) , without evidence of large vessel thrombus . electrocardiogram and echocardiogram were normal . despite serial thoracenteses , effusion recurred . 
 bacterial and fungal cultures , as well as cytology analyses for malignant cells , were all negative . after excluding infectious diseases , malignancies , pulmonary thrombosis , and heart failure , we added oral prednisolone ( 30 mg daily ) to his prior anticoagulant regimen . 
 the skin lesions and the pleural effusion improved rapidly , eventually disappearing without complication ( fig . 
 4 ) . on follow - up clinical examinations , no symptoms related to sle or other collagen diseases were noted . 
 common causes of pleural effusion include malignancies , infectious diseases , pulmonary embolism , collagen vascular disease , and heart failure . 
 aps - related pleural effusion has rarely been reported , and those cases that have been reported appeared to be complications of accompanying pulmonary embolism , sle , or catastrophic aps [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] . 
 pleuritis , which can induce pleural effusion , is the most common pleuropulmonary manifestation of sle . in the present case , after excluding these differential diagnoses , aps was determined to be the direct cause of the pleural effusion . 
 however , a strong possibility still exists that the pleural effusion may be associated with occult collagen vascular disease , particularly sle or lupus - like disease ( lld ) heretofore undiagnosed . 
 a long - term follow - up study in 128 patients with primary aps demonstrated that 11 patients ( 8% ) developed sle , while 6 ( 5% ) developed lld during a median follow - up period of 8.2 years ( range , 114 years ) . 
 the results of this study suggest that the pleural effusion may be attributed to a coexisting condition like lld , although our patient has not fulfilled american college of rheumatology diagnostic sle criteria to date . 
 this may be supported by the fact that oral corticosteroid therapy was a remarkably effective treatment of the pleural effusion that had previously been unsuccessfully treated by anticoagulant therapy and repeated drainage . 
 corticosteroids and immunosuppressants continue to be the treatment of choice for severe sle complications , including pleural effusion . 
 furthermore , the clinical manifestations of primary aps and aps associated with sle are similar , which makes it more difficult to differentiate these diseases . as pleural effusion can be life - threatening 
 corticosteroids might be an effective choice of treatment for intractable pleural effusion in aps patients .

"colloidal iv  vi semiconductor nanocrystals ( also known as quantum dots , qds ) are of increasing potential applications in telecommunication , photoelectronic device , and biomedical labeling , etc . 
 pbse qds are important materials because of the strong confinement effect due to their large bohr radius and the small band gap in near infrared region . 
 several approaches have been developed to prepare pbse qds with uniform size and high quantum yields [ 3 - 5 ] . 
 pbse / pbs   and pbse / sio2 core / shell structures have been synthesized to stabilize pbse qds . 
 but cdse should be a better shell material due to the higher stability under air condition , the lower lattice mismatch of ~1% , and the little change of the surface chemistry and physics . 
 it is difficult to grow cdse shells upon pbse cores using typical cadmium oleate anion precursor because of high reaction temperatures needed . 
 hollingsworth s group recently developed a method of ion exchange to form pbse / cdse core / shell structures in which cd atoms replaced pb atoms in the outlayers of large pbse qds . 
 however , it may not be easy to control the thickness of the cdse layers . in this work , we employed the  successive ion layer adsorption and reaction ( silar )  technology   to form air - stable pbse / cdse qds with strong photoluminescence 
 two solutions were prepared for cdse shell growth . a cadmium injection solution ( 0.04 m ) 
 was prepared by heating cadmium cyclohexanebutyrate ( 0.1804 g ) in oleyamine ( 8.130 g ) at 60c under n2 flow to obtain a clear colorless solution . a selenium injection solution ( 0.04 m ) 
 was prepared by mixing selenium powder ( 0.0316 g ) in octadecene ( 7.880 g ) at 220c under n2 flow until a clear yellow solution was obtained . 
 , pbse qds ( 4.8 nm in diameter , 1.01  10 mmol of particles ) dispersed in 5 ml of hexanes were loaded into a 25-ml three - neck flask and mixed with 1.500 g of octadecylamine and 5.000 g of octadecene . 
 a mechanical pump was employed at room temperature for 30 min to remove hexanes from the flask . 
 then , the predetermined amounts of the cadmium and selenium solutions were alternatively injected into the three - neck flask drop by drop with syringes using standard air - free procedures . 
 transmission electron microscope ( tem ) was used to characterize pbse and pbse / cdse core / shell qds as shown in fig . 
 1 . tem images and histograms of 4.8 nm pbse ( a , b ) and 6.2 nm pbse / cdse ( c , d ) qds . 
 the pbse and pbse / cdse qd samples shown here have narrow size distributions of 8.1% ( b ) and 6.9% ( d ) , respectively figure 2 shows the evolution of absorption and photoluminescence spectra of the pbse / cdse qds upon the series growth of three monolayers of cdse shells on the 4.8 nm pbse cores . 
 a consistent red shift of the peak wavelength was observed in both the absorption and pl spectra . 
 the red shifts of the first excitonic absorption peak for three layers were 11 , 10 , and 11 nm , respectively . 
 the red shift of absorption and pl spectra depends on several factors including ( 1 ) the connection between pbse and cdse renders the expansion of the carriers wavefunctions out of the core region with different expansion probabilities resulting in the increase of exciton distance and ( 2 ) the surface polarization due to the different dielectric constants of pbse and cdse materials . absorption ( a ) and photoluminescence ( b ) spectra recorded during cdse shell growth . a consistent red shift of the peak wavelength ( 11 , 10 , 11 nm ) was observed when one to three monolayers of cdse shells grown on 4.8 nm pbse cores the optical gap ( egap ) of pbse qds is the minimum energy needed to excite an electron from the valence band to the conduction band . 
 the optical gap is given by   where   are bulk material kinetic energies of the electron and hole , respectively ;   is band gap of bulk material ;   are the confinement kinetic energies of electron and hole , respectively ;   are the surface - polarization energies of the electron and hole , respectively ; and jeh is the direct electron 
 the size of the pbse qds ( 4.8 nm ) is much smaller than the bohr radius ( 46 nm ) ; therefore , in the strong confinement realm , the energy difference between the electron and hole should be as followed   where r is the radius of quantum dot particle ; and mr is the reduced mass of the electron and hole . 
 the energy of coulomb attraction is given by where   are the wavefunctions of the electron and hole , respectively ; and   is the potential function of the electron and hole . 
 the surface - polarization energies of the electron and hole are where   is the surface polarization potential where   is the screened coulomb potential of the qd at point   due to a point charge located at   and   is the same quantity in the corresponding bulk material system . 
 when two semiconductors contact , both electron and hole will induce tunnelling effect and the wavefunctions will diffuse into cdse shells . 
 the transmission coefficient can be given as   where e is energy barrier at the interface of core / shell structure ; m is the effective mass of diffusing particle ; a is the thickness of energy barrier . because the wavefunctions diffuse into shells , the confinement energy will change with the increase in shell thickness . according to eq . 
 2 , where t is the difference of transmission coefficients of electron and hole . from the energy levels shown in fig . 
 3[16 - 18 ] , the expansion probability of electron is bigger than that of hole because of the lower barriers of electron according to the very closed effective masses of electron and hole ( me = 0.070 , mh = 0.068 ) . in this case 
 , one nanometer shell barrier will result in a decrease in 17.55 mev for the confinement energy . 
 we have also calculated that the increase in coulomb energy is 0.068 mev for one nanometer barrier . 
 correspondingly , the red shifts of the first excitonic absorption peak for three individual monolayer cdse shells are counted as 10.81 , 9.45 , and 8.36 nm , respectively . 
 they are in good agreement for the experimental data taking account of the effect of surface polarization energy . 
 lumo and homo structures for 4.8 nm pbse qds and 0.35 nm cdse shell the third term in eq . 
 1 is the surface - polarization energy that affects the gap energy egap , which is the stark effect . 
 a certain number of defect states are expected on the surface of unpassivated pbse qds . 
 therefore , charge carriers trapped on or near the surface of qds may generate localized electric fields , where delocalized exciton states within the qds can be highly polarizable . 
 the surface polarization energy   versus local electric field  is given by   where  and  are the resolved exciton dipole and polarizability , respectively . 
 according to muller et al.s work , the spectrum shift of cdse nanorods depends on the direction of the external electric field . 
 the positive electric field induces red shift , and the negative one leads to blue shift . 
 since the qds in this work are spherical ( zero dimensional ) , it is reasonable that their peak shifts are independent of the direction of the electric field . 
 both positive and negative electric field can cause the emission peak to red shift , and the red shift increases when the electric field is stronger . 
 it has been known that unpassivated pbse qds surface is a pb atom - rich shell . 
 therefore , there may be polarization charges on the surface of pbse qds which generate surface - polarization energy . 
 however , the polarization charges are neutralized , because pb atoms on the surface of pbse qds connect to oleic acid ( the organic ligand used in the synthesis ) . 
 when the pbse / cdse core / shell was synthesized , cdse contacted with pb atoms instead of oleic acid ; this induced the increase of surface polarization charges . 
 the spectra shift to red because of the enhancement of the stark effect ( fig . 
 different crystal lattices and thermal expansivities for pbse and cdse will more or less induce surface defects at the interface of the two materials . the carriers will be trapped and result in the enhancement of the stark effect . 
 such local fields cause the first exciton peak to shift to red and suppress the emission strength due to a reduced electron  hole wavefunction overlap . 
 unbalanced charges may also decrease the photoluminescence efficiency ( quantum yield ) via nonradiative auger recombination . 
 the new traps were induced by surface defects depend on the shell growth . compared with the photoluminescence of one monolayer core / shell qds , 
 however , it was found that more shell layers resulted in a decrease in photoluminescence strength ( fig . 
 that is also because the tensile change at the interface is nonlinear with the shell thickness . 
 when pbse qds were covered with two layers of cdse , the good lattice tensility at the interface reduced the lattice mismatch and therefore increased the photoluminescence strength . 
 when pbse qds were covered by three layers of cdse , the lattice tensility was stronger and hence the photoluminescence strength decreased . 
 even so the quantum yield was still as high as 70% for our pbse / cdse core / shell qds ( ir-26 as the reference ) . 
 pbse qds are unstable even under the ambient conditions ( room temperature and room light in air ) ( fig . 
 this process for each particle induces the effective particle size decrease and the blue shift of the spectrum . 
 when the old oxidized surface is gone , the new surface will be oxidized quickly . for pbse 
 / cdse core / shell structures , cdse shells effectively prevent pbse cores from the quick oxidation . 
 the lifetime of pbse qds under ambient conditions therefore can be extended from a few days to at least a month ( currently available data ) . 
 the stability of pbse ( a ) and pbse / cdse ( b ) qds . 
 the cdse shells prevent pbse core from the destructive oxidation . compared with the unstable pbse core , 
 the pbse / cdse qds remained unchanged in conclusion , pbse / cdse core / shell qds with a quantum yield of 70% were synthesized . 
 the surface polarization and the expansion of carriers wavefunctions contributed to the spectral red shift . 
 the spectra red shifts during the formation of cdse shells were calculated , and they exhibited a good fit to the experimental data .

"in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves , the frequency of valve thrombosis increases due to pregnancy - related hypercoagulability . therefore , effective anticoagulation is critical in pregnant patients with mechanical heart valves but remains problematic because both oral anticoagulation and heparins have been associated with important fetal and maternal side effects ( 1 ) . 
 coumarin derivatives are anticoagulants of choice for mechanical heart valves , but they cross the placenta and are associated with coumarin - induced fetal loss or embryopathy ( 1 - 3 ) . 
 unfractionated heparin ( ufh ) provides an alternative therapy that avoids fetal side effects , however , the use of ufh is associated with increased maternal thromboembolic and bleeding complications ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) . low molecular weight heparin ( lmwh ) may be more advantageous than ufh ( 6 ) , and appears a good alternative . however , little clinical information and no reliable data are available regarding its efficacy and safety . no consensus has been reached about optimal antithrombotic therapy in pregnant patients with a mechanical heart valve . 
 coumarins are contraindicated in pregnancy in north america due to fetal concerns , but european experts have recommended low dose coumarins ( less than 5 mg daily ) throughout pregnancy given a very low frequency of fetal anomalies ( 2 , 3 ) . 
 reports of lmwh use began to appear , and many physicians now use lmwh because of its good safety profile for both mother and baby ( 7 - 10 ) . 
 however , treatment failures have been reported ( 11 , 12 ) , and no lmwh has been licensed for use in pregnant patients with mechanical heart valves . 
 available published data regarding the efficacy and safety of lmwh in this clinical setting have been derived from small case series , and usually enoxaparin has been used . here 
 , we report our experience of nadroparin treatment , and its associated pregnancy outcomes and maternal complications . 
 between 1997 and 2005 , 31 pregnancies were analyzed retrospectively in 25 women with mechanical heart valves . 
 basic characteristics and previous operative data are listed in table 1 . in 23 of these 31 pregnancies , 
 nadroparin was used as an anticoagulant during the first trimester with given informed consent , concerning the risks and benefits of lmwh . 
 others were anticoagulated with coumarin derivatives ( cmd ) with or without aspirin due to unawareness of pregnancy until the first trimester , or because of refusal or poor compliance on self - injected lmwh . in the lmwh - treated group , 
 when pregnancy was confirmed , coumarins were stopped and changed to subcutaneous nadroparin ( 7,500 u , twice daily ) , from 6 weeks to 12 weeks of gestation . 
 aspirin , at 100 mg / day , was also administrated throughout the pregnancy . at gestation week 38 
 , women were scheduled for labor induction and changed to nadroparin to avoid the delivery of an anticoagulated fetus . after establishing labor 
 , we carefully checked for hemorrhages and other complications , and babies were examined for congenital anomalies and weight . in the cmd - treated group , coumarins and aspirin were continued throughout the pregnancy and the target international normalized ratio ( inr ) was maintained between 2.5 to 3.5 . 
 coumarins were changed to nadroparin before 2 weeks prior to the expected delivery date to avoid fetal bleeding complications during delivery . 
 pregnancy outcomes , namely , numbers of healthy babies , fetal anomalies , fetal losses , and maternal complications , including thromboembolism or bleeding , were analyzed . to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lmwh , eight pregnancies , maintained using coumarins throughout pregnancy , were compared . 
 data were analyzed using spss for windows version 10.0 software and compared using the student 's t - test , at a level of significance of p<0.05 . 
 no maternal death or bleeding complication occurred in either the lmwh - treated group or the cmd - treated group . 
 frequencies of maternal thromboembolism were not different between the two groups ( table 2 ) . a maternal transient ischemic attack ( tia ) occurred in one case in each group , and both patients had previously undergone mitral valve replacement . 
 prosthetic mitral valve thrombosis occurred in three pregnancies , two in the lmwh group and one in the cmd group ( table 3 ) . 
 the two of these three patients underwent redo surgery , and other patient was managed on thrombolytic therapy . 
 numbers of live born and healthy babies were higher in the lmwh group ( table 4 ) . in both groups , two babies had low birth weights of 2.1 kg and 2.4 kg , but were otherwise healthy . in the cmd group , one baby had hydrocephalus . however , the frequency of fetal loss including therapeutic abortion and stillbirth were significantly higher in the cmd group . 
 two fetal losses occurred in the lmwh group , both occurred in cases of maternal valve thrombosis . 
 four fetal losses occurred in the cmd group , and one of these involved maternal valve thrombosis . 
 this study demonstrates that lmwh - based therapy is superior to coumarin therapy in pregnant women with a prosthetic heart valve , and that the use of nadroparin during the first trimester with 100 mg of aspirin throughout pregnancy could be a safe and effective protocol for thromboprophylaxis in these women . 
 recent recommendations , published in 2004 as part of the 7th american college of chest physicians ( accp ) consensus on antithrombotic therapy ( 12 ) , included the following three regimens : 1 ) aggressive adjusted - dose lmwh throughout pregnancy ; 2 ) adjusted - dose ufh , throughout pregnancy ; or 3 ) either lmwh or ufh between 6 and 12 weeks and close - to - term only and the use of cmd at other times . 
 our protocol was similar to the third regimen , but we also administered aspirin ( 100 mg daily ) throughout pregnancy to reduce coumarin dosages and the risk of thromboembolism . 
 the overall frequencies of maternal thromboembolism , including valve thrombosis , were similar in both groups , but the frequencies of live and healthy baby births were higher in the lmwh group . 
 these results demonstrate that lmwh - based therapy is a good alternative to coumarins , because it has similar anticoagulation effects with lower fetal side effects . 
 exposure to coumarins during the second part of the first trimester is associated with fetal loss , primarily due to spontaneous abortion or coumarin - induced embryopathy . 
 the reported frequencies of coumarins - related embryopathy vary for debatable reasons ( 14 , 15 ) , a recent study suggested that coumarin risk is dose related and that adverse effects occur mainly in women taking > 5 mg daily . 
 , the target inr was maintained with less than 5 mg of coumarins in all patients in the cmd group ; however , a half of these lost their babies due to abortion or stillbirth . 
 our results represent only observational data , and the effect of dose - related embryopathy remains uncertain . 
 lmwh does not cross the placental barrier and offers potential advantages compared with ufh in terms of better safety profile with less thrombocytopenia , less bleeding , less osteoporosis with prolonged treatment , a more predictable and rapidly reached anticoagulant effect , and the possibility of self - administration of anticoagulant therapy without laboratory monitoring 
 . however , treatment failures have been reported , and the use of lmwh for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves has become controversial due to small numbers of patients and a lack of accurate postmarketing data ( 16 ) . 
 a recent review of 81 pregnancies in 75 women treated with lmwh reported an 8.6% rate of valve thrombosis ( 17 ) , and found that appropriate dose adjustments could reduce the frequency of thromboembolism . 
 the 7th accp recommendations call for the use of lmwh at levels that achieve peak anti - factor xa values of around 1.0 u / ml ( 12 ) . a recent prospective study with deltaparin reported that dosages based on body weight were inadequate to maintain a therapeutic level of lmwh in pregnancy ( 18 ) . 
 our data demonstrate that valve thrombosis occurred in 2 patients treated with nadroparin ; a prevalence of 8.7% . 
 unfortunately , we did not monitor anti - xa levels during nadroparin administration , and thus , we can not conclude that valve thrombosis is associated with an inadequate nadroparin dose . 
 further studies , with sufficient statistical power , are required to clarify the clinical significance of anti - xa levels . in conclusion , despite the retrospective design of the present study , it might be worth to mention that lmwh appears a safe and effective substitute for any other anticoagulants in pregnant women with mechanical heart valves . 
 we have experienced that pregnancy outcomes are acceptable with lmwh , but that its efficacy for preventing valve thrombosis remains uncertain . 
 further studies are needed in order to establish appropriate management protocols for pregnant women with mechanical heart valves .","pregnant women mechanical heart valves frequency valve thrombosis increases due pregnancy related hypercoagulability

"head and neck cancer has been the seventh most common malignancy and also a major cause of morbidity and mortality , worldwide ( 1 , 2 ) . 
 squamous cell carcinoma ( scc ) has represented the most common histologic subtype of cancers originating from the region ( 3 , 4 ) . 
 cancers have been originating from oral cavity , larynx and pharynx comprised approximately 690,000 new cases and 4.9% of all cancer incidence through the world in 2012 ( 5 ) . 
 unfortunately , most of the head and neck cancer patients have presented with loco - regionally advanced disease ( 6 ) and despite improvements in treatment techniques , the five years overall survival of such patients has been still poor ( 7 ) several prognostic factors have defined for head and neck cancers that could influence response to therapy and eventual outcome . 
 these factors might be categorized as follows : ( a ) prognostic factors related to the primary tumor like tnm stage , malignancy grading , perineural invasion , vascular invasion , ( b ) prognostic factors related to the patient like age , sex , general medical condition , and ( c ) prognostic factors related to the treatment ( 8) .

 the present study has conducted considering the influence of genetic and geographic factors on epidemiology of head and neck cancer and lack of reliable data on its prognosis and treatment outcome in iran . 
 we have performed a retrospective analysis of 119 patients with non - metastatic non - nasopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck admitted between 2008 and 2014 to our clinical oncology center ( jorjani cancer center , emam hossein hospital , tehran , iran ) . 
 all medical records of the included patients have investigated and with a previously prepared fact sheet the following data have collected : age , sex , weight , height , date of pathologic diagnosis of the disease , primary tumor site , clinicopathological characteristics of the primary tumor , date of last follow up , date of recurrence and death ( if any ) . 
 the characteristics of the study population have then described and the overall survival ( os ) and event free survival ( efs ) of the patients and their relation with demographic and clinico - pathological factors have analyzed . 
 the categorical parameters have compared using two - sided pearson s  test or fisher s exact test , as appropriate . 
 the event free survival ( efs ) has defined as survival without progression , recurrence , and death . the overall survival ( os ) time has defined as the period from the diagnosis until death of any cause or until the date of the last follow - up , at which data point has censored . 
 all summary statistics on time - to - event variables have estimated according to the kaplan - meier method and compared using the log - rank test .

 in the present study , patients demographic characteristics like age and sex were similar to ones in other studies ( both local and in other geographic regions of the world ) ( 1 - 3 ) . 
 larynx was the most common primary site followed by oral cavity and this finding has been in concordance with most other reports ( 1 - 3 , 12 ) . 28 months os and efs of our patients was 61.2% and 52.4% , respectively . in a study on incidence and survival trends of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the netherlands , braakhuis et al . 
 has shown a 2-year survival rate of 72% for the patients had been diagnosed between 2007 and 2011 ( 13 ) . 
 oropharyngeal carcinoma has constituted the significant proportion of their head and neck cancers and its relation to hpv - positivity could contribute to the better prognosis has observed in their study population . 
 other possible reasons for the disparity between the survival rate has observed in their study and one in our investigation could be higher socioeconomic status of their patients and better access to health care facilities that resulted in earlier diagnosis and treatment of the cancer . in another study on prognosis of the patients with head and neck cancer , dwojak et al . 
 has shown a survival rate of 62% for american indians at two years ( 14 ) . 
 this finding was very similar to one observed in our study and could also be explained with previously mentioned reasons . in our patients 
 t - stage and n - stage have demonstrated to be significantly associated with survival and these findings are consistent with results of most other studies ( 15 - 17 ) . as an interesting observation in the present study , 
 patients with normal bmis had significantly higher mean efs in comparison with patients with bellow or above normal bmis . 
 nutrition has been a matter of concern in cancer ( especially head and neck cancer ) management . 
 obesity was one of well - known risk factors for cardio - vascular disease and has also related to an increased risk of cancer progression and death ( 18 ) . on the other hand , 
 malnutrition has shown to be a risk factor of worse prognosis in some types of cancer , including hnscc ( 19 , 20 ) . in a retrospective study 
 has included 706 patients with head and neck cancer diagnosed between 2004 and 2012 , takenaka et al . 
 has shown that bmi was a prognostic factor for survival , independent of primary site , and tumor stage . 
 patients with normal pre - treatment bmis had higher 5-year survival rate in comparison with underweight patients and this difference was statistically significant ( 62.7% vs. 32.2% , respectively p < 0.001 ) ( 20 ) . in terms of treatment modality , 
 patients whose primary treatment has included surgery had the same prognosis as ones with non - surgical approaches ( figure 1 , table 2 ) . 
 there were some evidence in the literature that has shown similar outcomes for head and neck cancer patients treated with surgical and non - surgical approaches ( 21 , 22 ) . 
 in a recently published randomized trial , iyer et al . has shown that there have appeared to be either no difference in outcome , nor a slight advantage favoring primary surgery plus rt compared with concurrent chemort for patients with advanced , nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( 5-year os rate was 45% and 35% , respectively p = 0.262 ) . only in subset analysis 
 , patients with oral cavity cancer had significantly better prognosis with surgical approaches ( 22 ) . in conclusion , our study seems to be the first that investigated outcome of iranian patients with head and neck cancer and factors influencing it .","patient abbreviations bmi body mass index stage tumor stage n stage lymph node stage

"carpal instability is broad category consisting of various patterns of injury , with dissociative type more common . 
 a 13 -year -old boy presented at 6 months following a fall with restriction of wrist movements . 
 patient had sustained a closed distal one -third both bones fracture forearm fixed with k -wire , and volar lunate instability was found during sequential follow -up . 
 posttraumatic carpal instability should be identified at the earliest to avoid poor hand function and morbidity associated with it . 
 carpal instability and its biomechanics have always been evolving due to the advancement in the field of radiology and arthroscopy . 
 lunate plays a pivotal role and acts like an intercalated segment in carpal stability , loss of anchorage of this key structure cause intercalated segment instability . 
 volar intercalated segment instability ( visi ) is a less common manifestation of dissociative carpal instability . 
 a 13-year - boy had sustained distal one - third radius and ulna fracture after fall on an outstretched hand . 
 open reduction and k - wire fixation was performed for both bone fracture forearm ( fig .

 serial x - rays showed a loss of normal alignment of radio - lunate in comparison with the opposite ( fig . 3 , 4 ) . 
 serial radiographs during follow - up showed a volar facing lunate with alteration of scapholunate and lunatocapitate angle and was diagnosed with a volar intercalated lunate instability ( fig .

 ( a ) clinical photograph at 1 year follow - up showing reduction of dorsiflexion ( 0 - 40 ) and ( b ) normal palmar flexion ( 0 - 80 ) of wrist . 
 carpal instability should be considered as a differential in patients presenting with chronic wrist pain and restricted movements following trauma . 
 classified carpal instability into four categories and lunato - triquetral ligament is involved in stage three which leads to volar lunate instability . 
 visi is a condition in which there is pathologic volar flexion of the lunate , with or without a similar posture of the other proximal row carpal bones . 
 posttraumatic volar lunate instability is an entity that can be missed during the initial traumatic event because of its subtle nature . 
 posttraumatic carpal stability diagnosed at the earliest avoids advanced surgical procedures such as reconstruction and fusion of joint . 
 lunate instability in plain radiograph can be diagnosed with the alteration of various angles namely the loss of scapholunate angle , loss of alignment between the lunate , capitate and radius and increase in the capitolunate angle . 
 treatment options include from closed reduction and k - wire fixation , dorsal capsulodesis , tenodesis , arthroscopic or open repair with reconstruction and finally arthrodesis . 
 this injury could be subtle in nature before reduction and fixation that led to delay in diagnosis or iatrogenic in nature after reduction of the fracture . 
 wrist function is a complex interaction of various biomechanics involving the carpal bones , ligaments , and the distal radio - ulnar complex . 
 awareness of carpal instability associated with fractures or injuries around the wrist is needed by the treating surgeon to avoid delay in diagnosis and treatment . to suspect visi following a wrist injury and also following reduction with k - wire fixation . 
 follow - up of patient at regular intervals to prevent morbidity due to this deformity .","patient sustained closed distal one third bones fracture forearm fixed k wire volar lunate instability found sequential follow

"surgical treatment of avascular necrosis ( avn ) of head of femur include core decompression , osteotomies , nonvascularized bone grafting , free vascularized fibular grafts , hip resurfacing , bipolar hip arthroplasty ( bha ) and total hip arthroplasty ( tha).123 tha is indicated in the young individual in avn with acetabular involvement ; however , its role is unclear in cases without acetabular involvement.4 bha was initially limited to be used in hip osteoarthritis , nonunions and acute neck femur fractures.56 bateman7 and giliberty8 were first to use bha in ficat stage 3 avn based on the hypothesis that 
 acetabular floor retains a regenerative property , which regenerates bone in the subchondral region , if stimulation in the form of weight bearing is given through an accurately fitted cup  and theorized that preferential motion at inner bearing will decrease the cartilage erosion . 
 papers have been published with both satisfactory91011121314 and unsatisfactory results using bha.5151617 the main limitations sighted are migration of the outer cup ( secondary to the acetabular erosion ) and unpredictable pain relief.3514 incidence of groin pain varied from 11.5% to 42%181920 and incidence of acetabular erosion and protrusio is reported to range from 0% to 45%.1819 the activity of the patient and the duration of followup determine the erosion of acetabulum and appearance of symptoms.21 however , the main issue seems to be motion between the outer cup and the acetabulum , a nonconcentric acetabulum and particulate wear.16222324 to decrease this motion between the outer cup and the acetabulum a gentle reaming of the acetabulum with insertion of tight fitting acetabular cup can be done as suggested above by bateman and giliberty.78 this is thought to decrease the incidence of groin pain and the acetabular erosion and also revision secondary to these issues.2526 in this retrospective series , we have assessed the midterm outcome of bha in young adults ( age < 60 ) with ficat stages 3 and 4 avn . 
 a retrospective study with a prospective followup was planned . 80 consecutive patients below 60 years of age ( 96 hips ) were operated by the senior author between 1995 and 2010 using bha with tight fitting cup technique . 
 all patients were males with a mean age of 42  6.44 years ( range 30 - 59 years ) . out of a total of 96 hips , 
 76 were diagnosed as idiopathic avn , 8 were posttraumatic avn while 12 were post alcohol consumption avn . 
 ficat 's classification system was used based on anteroposterior ( ap ) and lateral hip radiograph.26 clinically , the indication for surgery was pain with progressive inability to carry out daily activities . 
 patients with radiographs showing no or minimal acetabular involvement were included to undergo the procedure , while cases with advanced osteoarthritis with ostephytosis or protrusio were excluded . 
 surgeries were done in the lateral decubitus position using the posterolateral approach under epidural anesthesia . 
 the hip joint capsule was excised if diseased . in our study , intraoperatively on gross examination , all the 96 hips ( ficat stage 3 and 4 ) were found to have mild to moderate acetabular involvement as per steinberg et al.2 the cartilage was graded grossly as grade 0 ( normal ) if no abnormalities were observed ; grade i ( mild degeneration ) if there was superficial fibrillation and slight irregularity of the surface ; grade ii ( moderate degeneration ) if there was moderate fibrillation , alteration in color and consistency and thinning of cartilage without complete erosion to bone . 
 gentle superficial reaming of the acetabulum was done making the acetabulum concentric for a tight fitting bipolar cup [ figure 1a ] . 
 the trial cups should fit snuggly enough so that when the hip is taken through a range of motion , no gross movement should be appreciated between the outer cup and the acetabulum . 
 this assures that the prosthesis is tight fitting and movement between the outer cup and the acetabulum is avoided . during the process of making acetabulum concentric , sometimes subchondral bone was exposed . in these cases , 
 pulse lavage of the prepared acetabulum was done to remove all debris before putting the bipolar cup . 
 the size of the cup was equal to the size of the tight trial cup chosen . 
 we did keep instrumentation for total hip replacement ( thr ) ready intraoperatively ; however , we did not have to do thr in any of our selected cases . ( a ) peroperative photograph showing concentric acetabulum after superficial gentle reaming with the large hand reamer . 
 ( b and c ) x - ray taken in neutral and abduction showing movement taking place mostly at inner bearing self - centering cup with 28 mm inner head and uncemented stems were used in 60 hips ( zimmer , warsaw , usa , biomet , warsaw , usa ) . in the remaining 36 hips , normocentric hemispherical cups with 26 mm inner head and 
 cemented stems were used ( inor , mumbai , india and rch , mumbai , india ) . 
 the patients were allowed ambulation with support of a walker or crutches on the 5 postoperative day and were advised to use the same for a period of 4 - 6 weeks . 
 all patients were called for a final followup for clinical and radiological assessment . the clinical evaluation consisted of recording the details of thigh or groin pain , range of movements at the hip ( 
 patient was asked to sit cross legged on the bed ) , limb length discrepancy and harris hip score ( hhs ) . the radiological evaluation comprised of looking for subsidence of the stem , recording of any evidence of stem loosening in the form of a radiolucent line surrounding the stem and superior or medial migration of the cup . 
 ap x - rays were taken with the patient lying supine with the hip in neutral and abduction position to check for movement in inner and outer bearing as shown [ figure 1b and c ] . 
 the femoral component subsidence was evaluated by measuring the distance between the superior margin of the greater trochanter and the shoulder of the stem.3 medial migration of the bipolar cup was determined from the distance between a line perpendicular to kohler 's line and center of the outer head , whereas superior migration was indicated by a change in distance between the inter teardrop line and the centre of outer head means centre of the circle that is calculated from the circumference of outer cup of bipolar prosthesis that is easily outlined on the radiograph.3 all radiographic measurements were done by either of two authors on ap radiograph of the hip and were compared to the immediate postoperative radiographs . 
 a subgroup analysis was also done , by dividing the cohort according to ficat 's class , to evaluate the effect of acetabular involvement on the outcome of the procedure .

 the mean followup was 7.52  1.80 years ( range , 4 - 16 ) . 
 the hhs improved from a preoperative value of 39.33  6.11 ( 30 - 54 ) to 89.12  6.68 ( 74 - 96 ) ( p = 0.0001 , paired t - test ) in the postoperative period . according to hhs grades , the final outcome was excellent in 52 , good in 28 and fair in 16 hips . 
 hip and groin pain was reported in four hips ( 5% ) but this did not limit activity in any of the patient [ table 1 ] . 
 22 hips had flexion deformity of approximately 3 - 5 with a final range of flexion of 100.2  8.82 ( 85 - 116 ) . 
 subsidence of the femoral component was seen in 8 hips ( < 5 mm ) ; however , these hips were asymptomatic . shortening of 1 cm was noted in 10 limbs , and 1.5 cm shortening was noted in 1 limb . 
 there was no incidence of hip dislocation or dissociation of the bipolar cup and no case required revision . on ap 
 neutral and abduction x - rays there was no appreciable movements noted between the outer cup and the acetabulum in any of the case 
 . there was medial migration in 5 hips and proximal migration in 12 hips , but none more than 2 mm and all were asymptomatic . 
 comparison of results with various studies on subgroup analysis between the ficat stages 3 and 4 [ table 2 ] it was noted that hips with ficat stage 3 were younger at the time of surgery and also had better final outcome in terms of range of motion . 
 the final hhs score was however not statistically different in both groups indicating good results even in cases with acetabular involvement . 
 none of the ficat stage 3 patients had any groin pain or femoral subsidence at the final followup while 4 cases of groin pain and 8 cases of femoral subsidence were seen in ficat stage 4 group .

 surface replacement is an option in younger people with avn , but has limited indications and is a demanding procedure with high cost.27 the results published by for surface replacement are not uniform and a longterm followup is lacking.272829 tha is the method of choice for the treatment of advanced avn of the femoral head;53031 however , its overuse may lead to increased wear and need for early revision in young adults.14 various studies have shown that functional utility of tha reduces to 80% at 10 years , 33% at 16 years , subsequently requiring a revision surgery . 
 alternate bearing surfaces like metal on metal or ceramic on ceramic decrease the wear rate but have their own set of complications ( metallosis , squeaking)3233343536373839 and long term results are still awaited.40 when compared with bha , conflicting results have been reported . 
 chan and shih30 have reported that there was no difference in the incidence of osteolysis , thigh or groin pain , dislocation rates and revision rates between bha and tha . 
 they concluded that in young patients with ficat stage 3 avn , bha may be a useful alternative to tha . 
 furthermore , bha is less demanding , blood loss is comparatively less5 and revision is easier as compared with the revision of tha as the acetabulum is still intact.41 lee et al.3 have reported 23% outer cup migration rate , 15% gluteal pain and 20% groin pain in bha . 
 ito et al.15 have reported 42% radiological failures , 42% incidence of groin pain requiring a revision surgery in 25% hip undergoing bha . 
 similar results were shown by cabanela14 and lachiewicz and desman17 with groin pain and acetabular erosion as the two most important reasons for poor results in bha . 
 groin pain has been variably attributed to the preservation of diseased joint capsule , to irritation of the subchondral nerve endings of the acetabulum and to the acetabular erosion.1442 in our study , the diseased capsule was always excised to avoid capsular impingement . 
 furthermore , as nerve endings in the posterior capsule supply the acetabulum , excising it blocks the nerve supply to the acetabulum and thus helps in relieving pain . 
 poor fitting bipolar prostheses can lead to cartilage necrosis giving rise to groin pain and degeneration.3041 acetabular erosion has also been attributed to a fair amount of movement at the outer bearing due to a wide surface of the cup , which was greater than two third of a sphere.4243 reaming in bha technique creates a better fit that reduces movements between the outer cup and the acetabulum41 and ensures that on weight bearing , movements are transmitted to the inner bearing . in effect , this works like a low friction arthroplasty and results in reduced pain and damage to the acetabular bone stock.41 this also explains the low incidence of acetabular migration and low revision rate in our series . 
 dudani et al.25 too used the same technique and reported 80% good result at average follow of 7.2 years . 
 pellegrini et al.19 have reported a higher risk of revision with acetabular reaming while muraki et al.5 concluded that acetabular reaming increases the tendency of superomedial migration . 
 the uniformly good results at the mid term seen in our series may be attributed to the technique and amount ( depth ) of reaming . 
 pellegrini et al.19 reamed the acetabulum till a depth when the osseous floor showed punctuate bleeding . 
 we have used a more conservative reaming without breaching the integrity of the subchondral bone , and this is probably why we have low incidence and magnitude of medial migration . on the contrary [ figure 2c ] 
 the subchondral bone shows sclerosis , asserting the bateman hypothesis regarding the regenerate potential of acetabulum.44 in our series , ten patients showed this sclerosis . 
 nagai et al.43 in 12 - 18 years old followup study of nonself centering bateman bipolar endoprosthesis for nontraumatic osteonecrosis of the femoral head concluded that the original bateman endoprosthesis was effective in delaying the need for tha for more than 10 years in ficat stage 3 avn of the femoral head . however , the sample size was very small , with 4 out of 12 patients having some groin pain and study limited to ficat stage iii avn only . in another study tsumura

bipolar hip arthroplasty using tight fitting cup avn hip low incidence groin pain acetabular erosion revision midterm followup","background : bipolar hip arthroplasty ( bha ) is one of the options for treatment of avascular necrosis ( avn ) of the femoral head . 
 acetabular erosion and groin pain are the most allowing for gross motion between the common complications . 
 we propose that these complications are secondary to improper acetabular preparation allowing for motion between the bha head and the acetabulum.materials and methods : the current study retrospectively evaluated patientsrecords from case files and also called them for clinical and radiological followup . 
 96 hips with avn of the femoral head treated with bha were included in the study . 
 all patients were males with a mean age of 42 years ( range 30 - 59 years ) . in all cases , 
 the acetabulum was gently reamed till it became uniformly concentric to achieve tight fitting trial cup . 
 clinical followup using harris hip score ( hhs ) and radiological study for cup migration were done at followup.results:the mean followup was 7.52 years ( range 4 - 16 years ) . 
 the hhs significantly improved from a preoperative value of 39.3 ( range , 54 - 30 ) to a postoperative value of 89.12 ( range 74 - 96 ) . according to hhs grades , the final outcome was excellent in 52 hips , good in 28 and fair in 16 hips . 
 hip and groin pain was reported in four hips ( 5% ) , but did not limit activity . 
 subsidence ( less than 5 mm ) of the femoral component was seen in 8 cases . 
 subgroup analysis showed patients with ficat stage 3 having better range of motion , but similar hhs as compared to ficat stage 4 patients.conclusion:bipolar hip arthroplasty ( bha ) using tight fitting cup and acetabular reaming in avn hip has a low incidence of groin pain , acetabular erosion and revision in midterm followup . 
 good outcome and mid term survival can be achieved irrespective of the ficat stage ."
"worksites in glass and metal works , foundries , rolling mills , in the vicinity of hardening furnaces , rotary kilns in the cement industry , high - temperature laboratory furnaces , as well as firefighting , are associated , in addition to common mechanical hazards ( e.g. , due to splashes of molten metals and slag ) , sparks and direct contact with open fires , with hazards caused by emission of harmful optic radiation within the visible ( vis ) and infrared ( ir ) spectrum range . 
 excessive exposure to ir radiation leads to dryness of the mucous membranes , burns of the eyeball and development of cataracts . 
 protection against thermal hazards due to excessive amounts of ir radiation reaching the eyes is provided by protective optic filters installed in spectacles , goggles or face protections . besides protecting the user against hazardous ir radiation 
 , such filters should ensure that the object / area of work can be seen clearly . if the level of ir radiation is very high , 
 the use of filters reflecting radiation is recommended , as it allows the temperature increase in the filter itself to be reduced . 
 the filters currently used for the protection of the face and eyes against hazardous ir radiation are of metallic reflective type , made of glass or organic material ( mainly polycarbonate ) bases coated with a single metallic layer for reflectance of ir radiation or absorption filters . 
 absorption filters are manufactured from dyed glass obtained in a mass staining process by introduction of a factor modifying the radiation within the vis and near infrared ( nir ) spectrum range passing through the filter . 
 the effect of a protective optical filter obtained as a result of this process is based on absorption of a large proportion of optic radiation , whereas only a small proportion of radiation the filter is exposed to is reflected . 
 this is an undesirable phenomenon , contributing to deterioration of the filter user 's comfort . 
 reflective metallic filters are obtained by deposition of a metallic layer of copper ( cu ) or gold ( au ) on mineral or organic bases . 
 such filters take advantage of the characteristic properties of the metals used in their production , i.e. , significant reflection coefficient for ir radiation and significant transmittance for the vis spectrum . despite the fact that the technique of deposition of interference layers has been known for many years   the application of thin film ir filters in eye protections to block 
 the previous papers published by the authors of this study   contain descriptions of the structure of interference filters designed for application in eye protections 
 highly effective in reduction of ir radiation with high level of transmission of the vis spectrum . 
 the authors investigated also the optical and mechanical parameters of the newly developed protective optic filters manufactured with the use of interference technologies . 
 the analysis of the results of the conducted tests demonstrated numerous advantages of interference technology application in the construction of protective filters , including : improved resistance to damage of the external protective filter surface ( cracking , scratching etc . ) as well as high reflection coefficients for the nir spectrum . 
 the aim of the present study was to compare the optic properties of protective filters manufactured by taking advantage of the interference technology and those coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation . 
 the coefficients characterizing their optic parameters , allowing to assess the protective properties within the vis and ir spectrum range were compared . 
 the following coefficients were analysed : 
 luminous transmittance (  
 v),ir transmittance within the 7801400  nm range (  
 a),ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range (  
 n),ir reflectance within the 7802000  nm range ( r

 n ) , ir absorptance within the 7802000  nm range ( a 
 n ) , the level of protection ( shade number ) is determined on the basis of luminous transmittance ( the higher protection level correlates with the higher level of ir radiation blocked and appropriately lower vis light transmittance ) . 
 protection level consists of a code number ( e.g. , 4 ) for ir filters and a shade number ( e.g. , 3 , 5 , 7 ) calculated according to the following equation : 
 ( 1 ) 
 where  
 v 
 =  luminous transmittance . for the particular level of protection , the mean ir transmittance within the 7801400 and 7802000  nm ranges as well as the ir reflectance and absorptance within the 7802000  nm range are determined . 
 for comparative analysis of the metallic reflective filters available in the market versus the interference filters developed by the authors , the following samples were prepared for the tests : 
 off the shelf metallic reflective filters on a polycarbonate base ( flat parallel plate of 50  mm diameter and 2  mm thickness with a metallic layer of copper ( cu )  protection levels : 4 - 3 , 4 - 5 , 4 - 7);interference filters on a polycarbonate base ( flat parallel plate of 50  mm diameter with interference coating made up of the following materials : aluminium , h4  latio3 substance and silicon dioxide ) .

 note : protection level consists of code number ( 4 ) for infrared filters and shade number ( 3 , 5 , 7 ) calculated according to equation ( 1 ) . 
 optical properties of the filters were measured with a cary 5000 spectrophotometer ( varian , australia ) . the spectrophotometer enabled transmittance or reflectance of optical radiation within the vis and nir spectrum to be recorded with 1  nm steps and 0.001% resolution level . 
 spectral transmittance and reflectance measurements were carried out within the wavelength range of 7802000  nm . 
 the quartz halogen lamp was used as a source of radiation . to detect transmitted or reflected radiation 
 the photomultiplier tube and lead sulphide detector were used for vis and nir spectrum , respectively . 
 spectral transmittance was measured with incident radiation falling normally on the filter surface in the visual centre ( defined as in ) . for spectral reflectance 
 the measurements were taken every second owing to the high absorption of investigated filters within the nir region . 
 since the minimum averaging time of the cary 5000 spectrophotometer was 0.0125  s , the values of transmittance or reflectance were measured 125 times for a given wavelength . 
 the aforementioned coefficients were calculated from the following equations [ 1012 ] :

 optical radiation within the 7801400  nm spectrum range passes through the anterior compartment of the eye , the lens and reaches the retina . exposure to an excessive amount of radiation from this range 
 can result in burns of the retina and , in extreme cases , its permanent damage . 
 , chronic long - term exposure may lead to the development of cataracts , referred to as ir or glass worker 's cataracts . in view of the above 
 the results presented on the graphs in figure 1 and the determined transmittance values ( see table 2 ) indicate unequivocally more effective blocking of ir radiation provided by interference filters . 
 the values of  
 a and  
 n for interference filters are lower even by an order of magnitude than those obtained for the metallic reflective filters . 
 for instance , the mean value of ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range for interference filters with protection level 4 - 5 ( one of the most common protection levels used in the metallurgic industry ) equals 0.006% and is significantly lower than the maximum acceptable value specified in , which is 10.6% . 
 for all the investigated filters , the values of r 
 n exceed 60% , which classifies them in the group of filters with increased ir reflectance . 
 the levels of the ir absorptance for metallic reflective filters and interference filters of 4 - 3 and 4 - 5 protection class are similar . for the highest of the investigated protection levels  4 - 7 
 the above findings are important for selection of a filter appropriate for the radiation source . 
 the selection of filter protection level is dependent on the temperature of the radiation source . 
 the 4 - 7 level is used for radiation sources whose temperature exceeds 1600  k ( e.g. , occurs in the metallurgical industry ) . with such high temperatures , 
 reduction of filter heating as a result of exposure to ir radiation is important . as it follows from comparative analysis of the optic properties of filters taking advantage of the interference technology and filters coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation 
 , the interference filters provide a more effective blocking of ir radiation in comparison with the currently used protective filters .

"gck - mody ( gck diabetes , glucokinase diabetes , or mody2 ) is a monogenic condition caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding glucokinase ( gck ) . 
 it is characterized by chronic , lifelong , and mild hyperglycemia present from birth , and less than 50% of patients fulfil the criteria for overt diabetes . 
 the increased risk of atherosclerotic vascular disease  as compared with healthy individuals without diabetes  is known in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance , patients with type 2 diabetes , and patients with metabolic syndrome [ 3 , 4 ] . 
 noninvasive imaging techniques , such as carotid intima - media thickness ( cimt ) measurements , may help to stratify this risk of atherosclerosis , as well as the risk of myocardial ischemia : the cimt has been shown to independently predict coronary events in type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases . 
 however , the situation in gck - mody is likely to be different from that in type 2 diabetes : patients with gck - mody have increased fasting blood glucose and relatively low 2-hour post - ogtt blood glucose without other components of metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance . 
 such a blood glucose profile has been shown to be associated with lower rates of cardiovascular mortality among patients with type 2 diabetes . 
 importantly , niskanen et al .   demonstrated that components of insulin resistance syndrome , including hyperinsulinemia after an oral glucose load , serum lipid abnormalities , and elevated blood pressure , are major determinants of cimt in patients with diabetes . 
 the risk of macrovascular complications in gck - mody is considered low , but the data are scarce . 
 we aimed to evaluate the carotid intima - media thickness ( cimt ) as an indicator of this risk in gck - mody patients aging 35 years or older and their unaffected relatives , who share a similar environment and lifestyle . 
 we studied 27 patients from 20 czech families with genetically confirmed gck - mody ( age 3575 years ; median 46 years ) and 24 unaffected family members ( siblings , parents , and partners ) representing the control group ( age 3579 years ; median 50 years ) . 
 each of the 20 participating families contributed 1 to 3 patients with gck - mody and 1 to 3 control individuals matched by age and gender . 
 control individuals with fasting blood glucose more than 5.6  mmol / l ( 100  mg / dl ) and/or with a known history of diabetes were excluded from the study . 
 the identification of families with gck - mody has been reported previously [ 9 , 10 ] . 
 the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the 3rd faculty of medicine , charles university in prague , czech republic . 
 the structured assessment included a questionnaire , anthropometric examination and blood sampling for biochemical analysis . 
 high - resolution b - mode carotid ultrasonography ( using phillips iu22 ultrasound ) was performed to measure the cimt of the distant wall for 1  cm lengths of the carotid bifurcation and the internal carotid and right and left common carotid arteries . 
 the mean cimt values of 10 sites were combined in an unweighted average to produce an overall cimt . 
 the upper normal limit of cimt was set to 0.7  mm [ 12 , 13 ] . 
 the patient history of coronary heart disease and ischemic stroke was obtained from medical records . 
 the clinical and demographic characteristics of gck mutation carriers and control individuals were compared using welch 's two - sample t - tests ( continuous variables ) and fisher 's exact tests ( categorical variables ) . 
 mixed linear regression models with cimt , blood pressure , and serum creatinine as outcomes were used to estimate and test the adjusted effects of gck mutation status . age , gender , and mutation status 
 no significant differences in baseline characteristics were found between patients and control individuals , with the exception of fasting blood glucose ( gck - mody 7.6  mmol / l , sd  1.2 ( 136.4  mg / dl ) ; controls 5.3  mmol / l , sd  0.3 ( 95.4  mg / dl ) ; p < 0.0001 ) and glycated hemoglobin hba1c ( gck - mody 6.9% ( sd  1.0 ) , 52  mmol / mol ( sd  10 ) ; controls 5.7% ( sd  0.4 ) , 39  mmol / mol ( sd  3 ) ; p < 0.0001 ) ( table 1 ) . 
 the prevalence of smokers and hypertensive patients was similar in both samples ( p = 1 ) . 
 the measured cimt values for participants with and without gck mutations are shown in figure 1 . 
 the mean cimt was 0.707  mm ( range : 0.41.1 ) in gck - mody patients and was 0.692  mm ( range : 0.41.1 ) in healthy control individuals . according to the published recommendations [ 12 , 13 ] 
 after adjusting for age , gender , and family status , the estimated mean difference in cimt between patients and healthy individuals increased slightly to 0.049  mm ( 95% ci from 0.026 to 0.123 ; p = 0.19 ) . as expected , the estimated trends of mean cimt indicated a moderate increase in cimt with age and mutation status ( see regression lines plotted in figure 1 ) . 
 carotid plaques ( local intima - media thickening exceeding 1  mm and protruding into the lumen ) were identified in 7 ( 25.9% ) patients and 3 ( 12.5% ) control individuals ( p = 0.1 ) , but all of these plaques were hemodynamically insignificant . 
 myocardial changes typical of ischemic heart disease described on echocardiography and/or ecg were detected in three of 27 patients with gck - mody and two of the 24 healthy control individuals ( p = 0.866 ) . 
 three study participants had suffered from myocardial infarction ( two with gck - mody and one control individual ) ( p = 0.895 ) in the past , and two had suffered from ischemic stroke ( one with gck - mody and one control individual ) . 
 a similar proportion of participants ( 35% ) from both groups were treated for hypertension with one or more antihypertensive drugs . 
 four of the 27 patients with gck - mody ( 14.8% ) were treated with oral hypoglycemic agents , and one was treated with insulin . 
 to the best of our knowledge , the present study is the first case - control study including the cimt measurements of gck - mody patients older than 35 years . 
 the results are consistent with the mild natural course of gck - mody and confirm that gck mutation is not associated with an increased risk of developing macroangiopathic complications . 
 the 95% confidence interval of the cimt difference , adjusted for age , family , and gender , is 0.026 to + 0.123  mm , indicating that the possible increase in cimt associated with gck mutation is low and most likely clinically insignificant . 
 the absence of serious chronic microvascular complications in gck - mody was observed by page et al .   and 
 velho et al . [ 16 , 17 ] , who described proliferative retinopathy in less than 4% , proteinuria in 6% , and peripheral neuropathy in 5% of patients with hyperglycemia at more than 5 years after diagnosis . 
 a major problem with assessing diabetic complications in those patients is the differentiation between patients who only have gck - mody and those who develop type 2 diabetes in addition to gck - mody . 
 it is generally assumed that patients with gck - mody do not necessarily develop insulin resistance or dyslipidemia in the natural disease course , and their glucose tolerance remains stable over many years . nevertheless , carrying 
 a gck mutation does not protect against the development of type 2 diabetes , which occurs at a similar prevalence in gck - mody patients and in the general population . 
 it has been reported that metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are the major components of atherosclerosis risk in patients with diabetes and also in individuals without diabetes with insulin resistance [ 3 , 20 , 21 ] , whereas the role of hyperglycemia in cardiovascular disease associated with type 2 diabetes is less clear . 
 in contrast with patients with type 2 diabetes , patients with gck - mody have mild hyperglycemia without other components of metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance . therefore , our study adds to the accumulating evidence that chronic mild hyperglycemia without additional components of metabolic syndrome has a milder effect on the development of macrovascular complications compared with the same glycemic levels associated with metabolic syndrome components . 
 admittedly , more subtle effects on cimt would remain undetected , as the present study is moderately sized . 
 the numbers of available patients in other studies are , however , comparable  a detailed analysis of the effects of p.gly299arg mutation in the gck gene was limited to a single large pedigree , whereas another study reporting selected metabolic parameters and history data included 35 families , but these subjects were not examined at a single centre , and the data did not include cimt [ 16 , 17 ] . 
 thus , the number of participants may reflect a compromise between the depth of the acquired data and the subjects ' willingness to undergo a complicated set of investigations . 
 patients with gck - mody exhibit only a small increase in glucose levels after oral glucose loading . 
 by contrast , patients with type 2 diabetes have relatively high 2-hour glucose levels ( as a proxy for postprandial glucose levels ) , indicating that postprandial glucose levels could be the most pathogenic glycemic factor for developing micro- and macrovascular complications . 
 the cimt has been shown to correlate more strongly with postprandial glycemia than with fasting hyperglycemia . 
 additionally , the serum hs - crp levels are lower in gck - mody patients than in patients with type 2 diabetes . 
 however , a common variant in the pancreatic gck promoter has been shown to influence the risk of diabetes complications . 
 showed   that the a allele at c.30g > a of gck was associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease in not only patients with type 2 diabetes but also individuals who did not have diabetes , albeit with a much weaker association ( or = 1.27 ; 95% ci 1.021.59 ) . additionally , the snp rs4607517 , which is in linkage disequilibrium with c.30g > a , has been associated with fasting glucose in genome - wide association studies . 
 the association between components of the fasting glucose genetic risk score ( represented by five snps , including rs4607517 ) and cimt has been described with an increment of 0.0048  mm in carriers .   in conclusion , 
 our data indicate that the natural course of mild lifelong hyperglycemia is associated with a low risk of developing diabetic macrovascular complications . 
 however , patients with gck - mody should take steps to reduce the risk of developing  classical  type 2 diabetes in addition to gck - mody that is , avoid obesity and maintain a high level of physical activity . 
 our data support a conservative therapeutic approach for hyperglycemia in nonpregnant patients with gck - mody . 
 other risk factors for micro- and macrovascular complications should be treated according to present guidelines .","increased risk atherosclerotic vascular disease compared healthy individuals without diabetes known subjects impaired glucose tolerance patients type diabetes patients metabolic syndrome

 gck - mody is an autosomal dominant form of diabetes caused by heterozygous mutations in the glucokinase gene leading to a lifelong mild hyperglycemia . 
 the risk of macrovascular complications is considered low , but studies are limited . 
 we , therefore , investigated the carotid intima - media thickness ( cimt ) as an indicator of macrovascular complications in a group of patients with gck - mody . 
 methods . twenty - seven gck mutation carriers and 24 controls recruited among their first - degree relatives 
 were compared , all aging over 35 years . 
 the cimt was tested using a high - resolution b - mode carotid ultrasonography .

 the mean cimt was 0.707  0.215  mm ( mean  sd ) in gck mutation carriers and 0.690  0.180  mm in control individuals . 
 when adjusted for age , gender , and family status , the estimated mean difference in cimt between the two groups increased to 0.049  mm ( p = 0.19 ) . 
 no difference was detected for other characteristics , with the exception of fasting blood glucose ( gck - mody 7.6  mmol / l  1.2 ( 136.4  mg / dl ) ; controls 5.3  mmol / l  0.3 ( 95.4  mg / dl ) ; p < 0.0001 ) and glycated hemoglobin hba1c ( gck - mody 6.9%  1.0% , 52  mmol / mol  10 ; controls 5.7%  0.4% , 39  mmol / mol  3 ; p

 metformin is a biguanide that has been used as a first - line drug for type 2 diabetes treatment since 1957 in europe and 1995 in the us . 
 metformin was reputed to induce lactic acidosis , partly because phenformin , another biguanide , was withdrawn from the market because of an unacceptable rate of this complication . 
 however , numerous clinical studies reported a similar incidence of lactic acidosis in diabetic patients with or without metformin , leading some authors to deny the existence of metformin - associated lactic acidosis . however , in usual clinical practice , metformin contraindications are not often respected . 
 moreover , physicians do not really monitor adequately their prescription . as a result , numerous publications reported the association between metformin and lactic acidosis . when a cause of lactic acidosis such as shock state or acute renal failure is present , the responsibility of metformin could be questioned . 
 but when healthy patients without risk factors develop metformin poisoning leading to lactic acidosis , there is no doubt about this link . 
 however , metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis in different animal species and decreases mitochondrial respiratory chain complex i activity in different organs . 
 the clinical research on metformin - associated lactic acidosis was limited to retrospective studies describing incidence , risk factors , and supportive treatments . 
 a big step forward was made when the gattinoni group   reported a decrease in oxygen consumption after metformin poisoning in humans , strongly suggesting that metformin was able to induce mitochondrial dysfunction in humans . 
 the study by protti and colleagues elegantly confirms the implication of mitochondria in the pathophysiology of this disease . 
 of course , the importance of platelet mitochondrial dysfunction per se has to be put in perspective . 
 however , as demonstrated previously in the pig , platelet mitochondrial dysfunction mirrors the mitochondrial dysfunction in other vital organs . 
 platelets are more easily accessible than vital organs like the liver or kidney . for research purposes in humans 
 now that serious research on this rare disease has started , we can also imagine improving its care . 
 currently , the treatment is only supportive : increasing blood pressure with fluid infusion and catecholamines and promoting metformin elimination by renal replacement therapy . restoring atp production during energy failure due to mitochondria dysfunction is still challenging . 
 another condition associated with mitochondrial dysfunction , succinate can bypass respiratory chain complex i inhibition and restore oxygen consumption . in isolated cells 
 , succinate is reputed not to cross the plasma membrane , but methyl succinate ( a cellpermeant succinate ) has been used to bypass metformin blockade of respiratory chain complex i . 
 ","vitro experiments performed healthy platelets incubated increasing doses metformin whereas ex vivo experiments done platelets patients presenting accidental metformin induced lactic acidosis
however numerous clinical studies reported similar incidence lactic acidosis diabetic patients without metformin leading authors deny existence metformin associated lactic acidosis
another condition associated mitochondrial dysfunction succinate bypass respiratory chain complex inhibition restore oxygen consumption","does metformin - associated lactic acidosis really exist ? despite an old controversy , there is no doubt about it . but 
 do we understand what is going on ? 
 laboratory findings raised several hypotheses explaining the pathophysiology of this disease . 
 the main cause could be an inhibition of either gluconeogenesis or mitochondrial respiratory chain complex i. from bench to bedside , one hypothesis is now confirmed in humans . 
 metformin poisoning involves , at least partially , a mitochondrial dysfunction ."
"efforts in the field of biomarker research have pointed to the existence of circulating immune complexes as a novel class of tumor markers with diagnostic potential comparable with or greater than that of the corresponding free biomarker . 
 they include biomarker - immunoglobulin m ( igm ) complexes , which have been found in several neoplastic diseases , such as colorectal , liver , and prostate cancer [ 13 ] . 
 although they are supposed to be a valuable adjunct in differential diagnostics , the biological meaning of this kind of complexes has not been elucidated ; that is , it is not known whether they have any physiological role . 
 in addition , from the biochemical point of view , there is no insight into their composition in terms of the structural properties of the molecules recognized by igm . 
 prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) , a well - known tumor marker for prostate cancer ( pca ) , has been found complexed with igm in both benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) and cancer . in general , psa comprises heterogeneous molecules differing in primary structure and in glycan composition . 
 structural variability exists among psa forms in serum , seminal plasma , and hyperplastic or cancerous tissues [ 46 ] . 
 thus , using different experimental approaches , more than 30 immunoreactive glycoisoforms ranging in molecular mass from 6 to 35  kd have been separated from serum , seminal plasma , or prostate tissue [ 712 ] . 
 investigation of the structural heterogeneity of psa revealed that some distinct forms are more frequently associated with pca than with bph [ 1315 ] . 
 for example , some isoforms of precursor or pro - psa are cancer specific , whereas other internally cleaved or nicked ( multichain ) psa isoforms are characteristic for bph [ 16 , 17 ] . 
 this study was aimed at complementing existing data on psa - igm by defining molecular species of psa in circulating immune complexes . 
 having in mind the oligoreactivity and multivalency of igm and its preference for carbohydrate antigens , there is the possibility that it can selectively recognize known psa glycoisoforms [ 18 , 19 ] . beyond the clinical relevance for cancer detection 
 , this might be of basic importance , since tumor - associated antigens are known to be targets of immune surveillance [ 20 , 21 ] . 
 circulating psa - igm complexes separated by gel filtration from subjects with bph and pca were subjected to on - chip immunoaffinity profiling using monoclonal anti - psa antibodies . 
 the detected molecular species were subsequently analyzed for protein and glycan composition and compared to established psa forms . 
 monoclonal anti - free psa antibody , clone 8a6 ( recognizing epitope i ) , was purchased from hy test ( turku , finland ) . 
 monoclonal anti - psa antibody , clone 8311 ( recognizing free and complexed psa forms ) , was from medix biochemica ( kauniainen , finland ) . 
 alkaline phosphatase - conjugated anti - human igm and p - nitrophenyl phosphate ( pnpp ) were from institut virion\serion gmbh ( wrzburg , germany ) . 
 broad range sds - page molecular mass standards and silver stain kit were purchased from bio - rad ( hercules , ca , usa ) . 
 proteinchip : ps20 ( preactivated surface ) , q10 ( strong anion exchanger ) , cm10 ( weak cation exchanger ) , sinapinic acid , and proteinchip all - in - one protein standards ii were from bio - rad ( hercules , ca , usa ) . 
 microwell plates were from nunc ( roskilde , denmark ) and star - bottom tubes were from spektar ( aak , serbia ) . 
 total psa ( tpsa ) and free psa ( fpsa ) were quantitated using the appropriate commercially available irma psa assays ( inep , serbia ) according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
 serum samples from subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) and prostate cancer ( pca ) seen at inep , zemun , for psa determination as a part of followup , were obtained according to local ethical standards ( document gsp/05 and pr030/09 , approved by the institutional committee of inep ) . 
 diagnoses were confirmed using clinically established protocols based on psa level , physical examination , ultrasound , and biopsy . 
 individual serum samples from 18 patients with pca and bph were randomly used ( to reflect intrinsic heterogeneity ) to form three pools ( each n = 6 ) . 
 psa concentration ranges of the pca pools were 15.6776  g / l ; 35.4987.2  g / l and 20.73063.3  g / l . 
 psa concentration ranges of the bph pools were 0.85.1  g / l ; 0.42.5  g / l and 0.35.1  g 
 serum samples ( 400  l ) were applied to a sephacryl s-300 column ( 1.3  25  cm ) equilibrated with 0.05  m  pbs , ph 7.2 , and eluted with the same buffer and 1  ml fractions were collected . 
 psa - igm or psa was detected in the expected fractions , using solid phase assays with immobilized monoclonal anti - psa antibody . 
 antibody - coated tubes ( 1.2  g per tube ) were prepared by physical adsorption , overnight at 4c . after washing with 0.05  m  pbs , ph 7.2 , 
 tubes were blocked with 0.5% casein for 3  h at 37c and rinsed again . 
 ( a ) gel filtration fractions ( fractions 120 ) were added ( 100  l ) to coated tubes and incubated for 4  h at room temperature ( rt ) . 
 after washing thrice with 0.05  m  pbs , ph 7.2 , alkaline phosphatase - conjugated anti - human igm ( 100  l ) was added and incubated for 2  h at rt . 
 unbound conjugate was washed , and 100  l of pnpp substrate solution was added . 
 the reaction was quenched with 100  l  1  m  naoh after 30  min . 
 the absorption was measured at 405  nm using a wallac 1420 multilabel counter ( perkin elmer , monza , italy ) . 
 fractions containing psa - igm were concentrated and used for further analysis . in parallel , 
 the total igm was detected in void volume gel filtration fractions after direct immobilization on polystyrene microwell plates , using alkaline phosphatase - conjugated anti - human igm , as described above . 
 ( b ) psa was probed by the addition of corresponding gel filtration fractions ( 100  l of fractions 130 ) to anti - psa coated tubes following simultaneous incubation with iodinated anti - psa antibody ( 300000  cpm / tube ) , overnight at rt . after washing steps 
 , bound radioactivity was detected on a wallac wizard 1470 automatic -counter ( perkin elmer , waltham , usa ) . 
 samples of igm or psa - igm preparations ( 10  l ) were subjected to immunoelectrophoresis on 1% agar gel for 1.5  h at 4c . 
 purified sheep anti - human igm ( inep , zemun , serbia ) was used for detection . 
 psa fractions ( psa - igm or fpsa ) separated by gel filtration were profiled using on - chip immobilized monoclonal anti - psa antibodies , as described . 
 the corresponding antibody ( 5  l ) was applied to each spot of the preactivated surface protein chip array and incubated in a humid chamber overnight at 4c . 
 the spots were washed thrice with 5  l of 0.05  m  pbs , 
 ph 7.2 for 1  min at rt and then blocked with 0.05  m  tris - hcl , ph 8.0 buffer for 1  h in a humid chamber at rt . after washing three times using the same procedure , 5  l of examined sample was added to each spot and incubated for 2  h in a humid chamber at rt . 
 the spots were rinsed again thrice with 0.05  m  pbs , ph 7.2 , and twice with deionized water . 
 all procedures included shaking ( 150  rpm ) . after drying , 1  l of 50% sinapinic acid in acetonitrile / dh2o / trifluoroacetic acid ( 50%/49.9%/0.1% ) was added to each spot , dried , and then reapplied . 
 nonspecific binding was monitored using igm ( figure 1 , fraction 10 ) as control sample . 
 protein chips were analyzed by surface - enhanced laser desorption / ionization time of flight mass spectrometry ( seldi - tof / ms ) using the proteinchip reader , series 4000 , personal edition ( bio - rad ) . 
 all spectra were acquired in 25  kv positive ion acquisition mode , in mass range 2.5300  kda , and with 8815 laser shots per spot . 
 all spectra were analyzed using ciphergen express software 3.0 ( bio - rad , hercules , ca , usa ) . 
 the spots with incorporated quaternized ammonium groups ( q10 , strong anion exchanger ) or carboxymethyl groups ( cm 10 , weak cation exchanger ) were prewetted twice with 5  l of 0.05  m  tris - hcl , ph 8 , for 5  min at rt . after removing the prewetting buffer , 5  l of the examined sample ( bph fpsa or pca fpsa ) was added to each spot and incubated for 1.5  h in a humid chamber at rt . 
 the spots were rinsed thrice with 0.05  m  tris - hcl , ph 8 , and twice with deionized water . 
 after drying , 1  l of 50% sinapinic acid in acetonitrile / dh2o / trifluoroacetic acid ( 50%/49.9%/0.1% ) was added to each spot , dried , and then reapplied . 
 a representative psa - immunogram , revealing typical differential elution positions of the main serum fractions , is shown in figure 1 . 
 psa - igm ( b ) is eluted at the trailing edge of the total igm peak ( a ) . 
 as deduced from its elution position and immunoelectrophoretic appearance ( data not shown ) , psa - immunoreactivity of igm complexes seemed to be partly associated with low molecular mass igm . 
 gel filtration profiles of several individual runs of pooled pca and bph sera gave no striking difference in psa - igm peaks , but psa - act ( c ) and fpsa ( d ) peaks were considerably lower in bph , as expected . 
 psa - igm preparations from pooled pca and bph sera were further subjected to on - chip immunoaffinity chromatography , to determine psa forms in the immune complexes . 
 typical mass spectra of psa - igm preparations from bph and pca sera , profiled using anti - fpsa antibody , are shown in figure 2 and table 1 . 
 the general pattern was similar , comprising dominant peaks at 17  kda and 28  kda . 
 the main difference was the presence of a 26889.27  da species in pca psa - igm absent from bph psa - igm . 
 this appeared as doubly charged ion , which might be related to its structural properties . in comparison to the species at 26.8  kda , 
 the observation of minor peaks at 15.8  kda or at 16.0  kda which have close molecular masses was not considered as relevant difference . 
 in addition to anti - fpsa antibody , anti - psa antibody , recognizing both free and complexed forms , was also used for on - chip chromatography . 
 comparable spectra were obtained but the intensity and frequency of particular peaks differed slightly . however 
 , this did not additionally contribute to separation and individual characterization of psa ( data not shown ) . 
 psa - immunoreactive forms complexed with igm , in both bph and pca , overlapped distinct molecular species observed in mass spectra of fpsa fraction ( figure 3 ) . 
 cluster at 28  kda was common for both pca psa - igm ( figure 2(a ) ) and pca fpsa ( figure 3(a ) ) , whereas the 15.8  kda species was more abundant in pca fpsa compared to pca psa - igm . 
 as for bph , fpsa fraction displayed a more restricted pattern with the main forms at 27595.81  da and 28244.95  da ( figure 3(b ) ) in contrast to bph psa - igm ( figure 2(b ) ) . taking the mass spectra of psa - igm preparations obtained from different pools of sera together , subtle differences ( some peaks were occasionally present ) were noticeable but they all revealed psa separation into several peaks ; that is , they suggested the presence of different psa glycoisoforms in immune complexes with igm . 
 taking into account the theoretical mass of psa peptides and their carbohydrate moiety , the observed psa - igm species were matched to amino acid sequence and glycan composition of established psa isoforms ( table 2 ) . 
 the deduced glycan masses of dominant peaks at 17  kda in bph psa - igm and pca psa - igm ranged between 1121 and 1259  da . 
 the distinct pca psa species at 26889.27 is supposed to contain trimannosyl core / paucimannosidic structures ( mm ) , based on the deduced glycans mass of 800.16  da . 
 psa species at 28  kda are assessed to contain fucosylated or nonfucosylated monosialylated biantennary chain with terminal n - acetylglucosamine ( gnnaf / nagnf ) or galactose ( naa / ana ; anaf / naaf ) . 
 in addition , the modification through bisecting glucosaminylation ( nagnfbi / gnnafbi ) is also suggested . 
 28.9  kda peaks in both bph and pca have estimated glycan mass of 2817  da . 
 this is higher than mass of complete psa glycan ( 2352  da ) , and it might be assigned to triantennary oligosaccharide chains . due to the limited amounts of particular psa species for direct analysis , the predictions were validated using ion - exchange chromatography of uncomplexed psa as reference . taking into account , 
 known data on isoelectric point of psa glycoisoforms ( pi 6.97.7 ) , corresponding samples were separated on anion and cation exchangers at ph 8.0 . 
 the results obtained indicated that incompletely glycosylated psa ( 17  kda ) showed weak binding to both ionic exchangers in contrast to sialylated forms ( 28  kda ) which bound strongly to anionic exchanger ( figure 4 ) . 
 thus , the observed charge heterogeneity of psa molecular species was in agreement with their predicted various degrees of glycosylation . 
 according to the observed molecular masses , psa has been classified into two more or less heterogeneous groups of glycosylated ( gp28 , gp22 , gp18 , and gp12 ) or nonglycosylated ( p26-full length nonglycosylated psa , p20 , p16 , p10 , and p6 ) peptides . 
 lower molecular mass psa results from protein cleavage at several different sites , among which major forms comprise those cuts at either lys182/ser183 or lys145/ser146 or at both residues [ 4 , 16 ] . 
 our results indicate that the major molecular species of pca psa and bph psa found complexed with igm corresponded to gp18 , which is glycosylated psa amino acid residues 1145 . 
 in addition , minor forms corresponding to the entire mature glycosylated psa species , that is , gp28 , were also observed . 
 psa is defined as a 28.430  da glycoprotein containing 8% of carbohydrates mainly as a biantennary n - linked oligosaccharide of n - acetyllactosamine type with sialic acid group at the end of each of the two branches . however 
 , available data indicate that there is pronounced heterogeneity under both normal and pathological conditions . 
 psa isoforms differ , generally , in sialic acid content as well as outer chain features [ 2325 ] . 
 besides biantennary chains , monoantennary sugar chains and peripheral structures composed only of n - acetylhexosamine residues also occur . 
 the results obtained in this study indicated that psa species complexed with igm mostly contained incomplete glycan chain lacking sialic acid . 
 thus , the main psa species complexed with igm are assessed to have oligomannosidic structure in both bph and pca . in addition , 
 alterations in psa glycosylation were reported in both bph and pca [ 2630 ] . specifically , psa forms with reduced sialylation , fucosylation changes , and increased pi were found in pca . as for unusual mannosidic structures found in psa - igm , 
 it represented a minor fraction , that is , only 0.6% of the total psa isoforms , and comprised four psa species ranging from 26808.9 to 27295.8  da . 
 it seems that newly found igm - bound isoforms could have diagnostic potential to distinguish pca and bph , but with no advantage in comparison to other established parameters ( total psa - igm or fpsa / psa ) . due to intrinsic heterogeneity of total psa - igm and complexity of the method applied , 
 their possible relevance should be confirmed by testing different types of samples , using different experimental designs suitable for clinical use . 
 however , the finding of distinct igm - bound psa forms may be of interest in light of recent data indicating paucimannose as marker of human cancers [ 31 , 32 ] . 
 in contrast to these poorly glycosylated psa species found in complex with igm , the main fpsa species contained predominantly mono- or disialylated biantennary chains . 
 the fpsa fraction was used as the reference , because it is supposed to comprise an abundant species that can be recognized by igm . 
 psa complexed with act was not considered relevant for this interaction , since it predominantly contains covalently bound enzymatically active psa . 
 psa glycosylation is very important for its biomarker potential and this was investigated in a number of studies under diverse physiological and pathological conditions . 
 generally , an examination of psa glycosylation , especially numerous psa species / glycoforms , is faced with the problem of small amounts , preventing isolation in sufficient quantity for glycan analysis . 
 in addition , the limitation is related to the known influence of both glycan and peptide on psa behavior during electrophoretic and chromatographic separations . using data on the psa standard preparation obtained by mass spectrometry , assessment of psa glycosylation by calculation of glycan mass 
 has already been proved relevant . in this study , this was combined with on - chip immunoaffinity chromatography and ion - exchange chromatography , which enables simultaneous sensitive detection of various psa glycoforms . 
 thus , despite the differences in methods and detection systems used for this analysis and those reported in the reference literature , generalizations about the composition of psa isoforms , based on congruence in patterns of protein and glycan moieties , can be made . 
 differences between calculated and theoretical masses extended to 0.1  kda , which may be due to common ion adducts observed in mass spectrometry . 
 however , for the psa species at 28.9  da , the difference was significant . 
 psa species having masses higher than 28.4  kda are also reported in seminal plasma and serum , but they are not characterized in detail [ 6 , 8 , 11 , 12 ] . 
 their relation to psa forms containing multiantennary chains or to pro - psa , as suggested by some authors , can not be confirmed or denied . 
 it is known that the structural integrity of psa significantly influences its biological activity and ability to interact with different molecules . as the first line of defense 
 , igm has a special position in the immune system and the discovery of psa - igm complexes opens an interesting point beyond its biomarker potential . is the binding of modified carbohydrates , as in the case of psa , a general principle , not only of basic , but also of clinical interest , for instance , in relation to cancer immunotherapy ? 
 different active and passive vaccines , including carbohydrate - based vaccines to aberrant glycostructures , are under clinical trials but have had limited success at proof of principle and efficacy stages . 
 characteristic psa glycoforms bound to igm , as emerged from this study , direct further investigations to structural comparison of different tumor markers found in immune complexes and their free forms and hold promise for advancement of their use as targets for cancer detection and therapy . 
 the results obtained indicated distinct differences in immuno - complexed pca psa compared to bph psa , although both were predominantly composed of nonsialylated incompletely glycosylated molecular species . 
 it poses the question of the possible role of glycosylation as a framework for immunoreactivity and immunoediting , representing a mechanism for early elimination or inactivation of aberrant cancer molecules and cells .","circulating psa igm complexes separated gel filtration subjects bph pca subjected chip immunoaffinity profiling using monoclonal anti psa antibodies

"bladder cancer ( bc ) is the ninth most common malignancy in the united states with 74,000 new cases and 16,000 deaths estimated for 2015 . since radical cystectomy ( rc ) 
 is the standard treatment for clinically localized muscle - invasive bladder cancer many patients undergo surgery with curative intention . 
 unfortunately , though the majority of patients are rendered disease - free after surgery , a significant proportion go on to develop bc recurrence and to ultimately succumb to the disease . for patients undergoing cancer surgery 
 , there has been recent interest in identifying perioperative factors that may modulate recurrence and cancer - specific survival after surgery . 
 it has been suggested that perioperative blood transfusion ( bt ) may be one such factor [ 35 ] . 
 blood transfusions represent the top five most frequently overused therapeutic procedures in the united states [ 6 , 7 ] . 
 unfortunately , a clinically significant number of patients ( 3075% ) with bc receive blood products during and after rc [ 810 ] . although bts can be life - saving in some clinical perioperative circumstances , there are adverse events associated with their administration including transfusion - related immune suppression ( trim ) . 
 trim is one proposed mechanism by which bts may be linked to poor oncologic outcomes . 
 several retrospective studies have demonstrated that perioperative bts are independently predictive of poor survival in patients with bladder cancer [ 1214 ] . 
 a meta - analysis by wang and colleagues demonstrated the association between bts and decreased recurrence - free survival ( rfs ) and overall survival ( os ) . 
 however , three recent studies that included more than 6,500 patients in aggregate were recently published and are not part of that meta - analysis [ 1618 ] . 
 we sought to assess the impact of bt on cancer - related outcomes and mortality in patients who had rc for muscle - invasive bladder cancer . 
 we conducted a systematic review of the literature and meta - analysis to test for an association between perioperative bts and recurrence - free , cancer - specific , and overall survival in patients undergoing rc . 
 we searched ovid medline and embase , pubmed , cochrane library , and the clinicaltrials.gov databases from inception to june 2015 , with no limits of language or publication type . to identify additional studies 
 , we also searched the 20102015 meeting abstracts of the american society of clinical oncology , the american urological association , and the european association of urology . 
 database search strategies included controlled vocabulary ( e.g. , medical subject headings ) and keyword terms to find studies addressing perioperative transfusions or related procedures ( such as blood salvage or hemodilution ) of whole blood or blood components in bladder cancer patients . 
 outcomes sought by the search strategies included blood loss ( intraoperatively or postoperatively ) , cancer - specific outcomes ( e.g. , recurrence , metastasis , and disease progression ) , and survival . 
 all searches were performed by a medical librarian ( greg pratt ) who has contributed to more than 50 systematic reviews and meta - analyses . 
 the primary outcomes of interest were recurrence - free survival , cancer - specific survival , and overall survival . 
 we defined a perioperative bt as any amount of prbc within one month before and one month after rc . 
 we included randomized controlled trials ( rcts ) , prospective cohorts , and retrospective studies that evaluated the impact on any ( allogeneic versus autologous versus intraoperative recovered  cell saved  ) packed red blood cells ( prbcs ) in patients with bc who underwent rc . 
 we excluded studies considering patients with distant metastases at surgery ; those in which recurrence - free survival , cancer - specific survival , or overall survival were not indicated ; and abstracts or poster presentations . 
 studies with a score of 6 or lower in the ottawa - newcastle scale were also excluded from any statistical analysis . for studies with overlapping patient populations , 
 we calculated the pooled hazard ratio ( hr ) estimates and 95% confidence intervals by random effects model using the method of dersimonian and laird ( d + l ) . to derive pooled estimates 
 , the d + l method calculates weights by taking the inverse of a combination of within - study and between - study variability , which provides a larger variance compared with the variance produced from fixed effects analyses and thus wider confidence intervals . 
 cochran 's q - test was used to test the null hypothesis of no significant heterogeneity across studies . 
 cochran 's q - statistic follows  distribution with ( k  1 ) degrees of freedom , where k is the number of studies . 
 i or the percentage of variation in the measures of association across studies due to heterogeneity was also calculated . 
 i is the equivalent to the quantity of cochran 's q minus its degrees of freedom divided by cochran 's q , or i = ( q  df)/q . 
 the value of i ranges between 0% and 100% , where 0% indicates no observed heterogeneity and larger values indicate increasing heterogeneity . 
 the summary effect measure on hazard ratio for intraoperative transfusion on the time - to - event endpoints ( overall survival , cancer - specific survival , and recurrence - free survival ) was obtained . 
 lastly , a sensitivity analysis was conducted to test whether the results of the meta - analysis were sensitive to restrictions on any of the included studies . 
 all statistical analyses were performed using r software ( version 3.0.2 , the r foundation for statistical computing ) . 
 the initial search identified 14 potential studies that underwent full review ( figure 1 ) . of these , 6 studies were excluded and 8 studies were included in the analysis . 
 abel 's study included data from 2 different institutions ; thus the 2 substudies were considered separately for statistical analysis . 
 only 5 studies clearly stated that patients were transfused with allogeneic blood ; the remaining studies did not specify the type of blood . 
 the leukoreduced status of the blood units was not clarified in any of the included studies . 
 two studies differentiated between intra- and postoperative blood transfusion and found that patients transfused intraoperatively but not postoperatively had worse survival [ 10 , 17 ] . 
 eight studies including a total of 15,655 patients reported overall mortality as an outcome ( table 1(a ) ) . of those patients , 
 the 2 studies that did not identify bt as an independent risk factor of os did observe an important trend to worse os [ 9 , 10 ] . 
 as shown in figure 2 , perioperative bts were associated with a 27% ( or [ 95% ci ] : 1.27 [ 1.151.40 ] , p < 0.05 ) increased risk in mortality ( figure 2(a ) ) . 
 the i test demonstrated moderate to substantial heterogeneity ( 68.3% , p = 0.0014 ) across the studies . seven studies including a total of 14,878 patients estimated cancer - specific survival in the statistical analysis ( table 1(b ) ) 
 . the rate of transfusion in this pool of patients was 38% ( n = 5,618 ) . 
 five of the 7 studies ( n = 6,521 ) demonstrated a negative impact of bt . as shown in figure 3 , the risk of dying from cancer after perioperative bt was 29% ( or [ 95% ci ] : 1.29 [ 1.131.46 ] , p < 0.05 ) ( figure 2(b ) ) . 
 the i test demonstrated moderate heterogeneity ( 60% , p = 0.012 ) across the studies . 
 five studies including a total of 8,778 patients estimated recurrence - free survival ( table 1(c ) ) . 
 three of the 5 studies ( n = 4,910 ) showed a significant association between perioperative blood transfusions and poor survival [ 10 , 17 , 20 ] . in abel 's study patients 
 the association was present for the mayo clinic 's population of patients but not for university of wisconsin 's patients . 
 as shown in figure 2 , perioperative bts were associated with a significant increased risk in reduced rfs ( or [ 95% ci ] : 1.12 [ 1.121.31 ] , p < 0.05 ) ( figure 2(c ) ) . 
 the i test demonstrated low heterogeneity ( 0% , p = 0.549 ) across the studies . 
 the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that none of the studies included in the meta - meta - analysis was very influential , as the hr ranged from 1.20 to 1.30 , 1.24 to 1.34 , and 1.18 to 1.26 for os , css , and rfs , respectively , for the pooled meta - analysis and all omitted meta - analyses ( table 2 ) . 
 both the true nature of an association between bt and cancer recurrence and the biologic mechanism to explain this association are still very much unanswered research questions . 
 the most commonly cited and investigated mechanism is the one that involves immune suppression or trim . 
 however , it has been speculated that the infusion of growth factors ( vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor - b ) and an enhanced inflammatory response as a result of the exposure of the recipient immune system to donor microparticles could also stimulate spread and proliferation of cancer cells [ 24 , 25 ] . 
 the present meta - analysis was not designed to investigate these possibilities ; however , our results support the hypothesis that the perioperative administration of prbcs is an independent risk factor for reduced rfs , css , and os after rc for bladder cancer similar to what has been reported for other cancers such as colon , lung , and esophagus [ 12 , 2628 ] . 
 although a recent meta - analysis conducted by wang and colleagues showed similar results to ours , we consider the findings of the present study clinically relevant because first we included data from two recently published cohort studies with relatively large sample size . 
 therefore , a larger number of transfused and not transfused patients were part of the pooled analysis of the present meta - analysis . 
 and second we conducted a different analysis ( random effects and fixed effect models ) in comparison to that published by wang and colleagues who used a fixed model paradigm . 
 we believe that a random effects model strengthens the analysis and adds significant information to the current evidence because this model assumes that the pooled studies are not functionally equivalent as they were conducted by researchers operating independently . 
 sources of variation among the studies used in the meta - analysis are , for instance , time of transfusion ( intra- versus post- versus intra- and postoperative ) and trigger of transfusions . 
 therefore , our analysis can be generalized to different clinical scenarios of bladder cancer surgery [ 29 , 30 ] . 
 it is worth mentioning that two studies did try to evaluate the impact of time of transfusion on outcomes and found that intraoperative bts are an independent risk factor for poor survival while postoperative bts do not show an association with worse outcomes [ 10 , 17 ] . 
 our meta - analysis shows significant heterogeneity or high degree of dissimilarity among studies for css and os but not for rfs . 
 although the high level of heterogeneity between studies for css and os tempers the strength of any conclusions that can be made about the effect of bt on these two survival outcomes , the low heterogeneity and identical estimated hrs for rfs using both random effects and fixed effect models suggest a strong association between perioperative bt and bc recurrence after rc . in this meta - analysis , patients who received a perioperative bt had a 21% higher risk of bc recurrence than patients who did not receive bt . 
 the present study has the limitations inherent to any study level meta - analysis of cohort studies . 
 although we used the ottawa - newcastle score to grade study quality , all of the included studies were retrospective ; the possibility exists that confounding variables ( i.e. , staging and tumor volume ) may have influenced the individual study results and by extension the findings of this meta - analysis . 
 furthermore , the results of the present study can not be extrapolated to the use of autologous blood transfusion since it is assumed that all studies included in the meta - analysis reported outcomes in patients transfused with mainly allogeneic blood . in conclusion , perioperative bt may be associated with reduced rfs , css , and os in patients undergoing rc for bc . 
 a well - designed prospective rct is needed in this population to provide the high level evidence necessary for answering this question .","several retrospective studies demonstrated perioperative bts independently predictive poor survival patients bladder cancer

"our patient , a 60-year - old woman , originally presented to her primary care physician for pelvic discomfort in september 2006 . at that time 
 , she underwent a pelvic ultrasound as well as a computed tomography ( ct ) scan of the abdomen and pelvis , which showed a complex ovarian mass . 
 a pap smear performed one month later was positive for atypical glandular cells suspicious for adenocarcinoma . in november 2006 
 , she underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy , omentectomy , and periaortic lymphadenectomy . upon intraoperative exam , her surgeons noted involvement of the omentum and appendix , as well as studding of the small bowel mesentery and right diaphragm . 
 the pathologic specimen showed extension of the tumor throughout the fallopian tubes , appendix , omentum , and 5 out of 5 positive lymph nodes . 
 the patient underwent placement of an intraperitoneal catheter and an intravenous port - a - cath for initiation of chemotherapy in december 2006 . 
 the remainder of the patient 's past medical history is noncontributory as she was previously in excellent health prior to the diagnosis of ovarian cancer . 
 unfortunately , she suffered a hypersensitivity reaction to the taxol , and was therefore switched to carboplatin and abraxane . 
 she received a total of 8 cycles of that combination , with only 1 cycle postponed secondary to neutropenia . just before the 8th cycle , in order to assess her response to treatment , she underwent a ct scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis . 
 in addition , her ca-125 level , which had previously reached a plateau of 30 u / ml , had risen to 123 u / ml . concerned about the possibility of drug - resistant disease , she was evaluated for enrollment in a trial of avastin and tarceva . 
 she underwent a new ct scan of the chest , abdomen , and pelvis , in order to obtain baseline data for the trial ( 3 months after her previous ct scan ) . 
 the new ct scan showed interval development of right axillary lymphadenopathy ; the largest lymph node was 1.1 x 1.8 cm and suspicion of a new primary breast cancer was raised . 
 we proceeded with breast magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) with gadolinium which showed no suspicious lesions or masses . 
 however , she developed a significant rash in association with these drugs and required dose reduction . in october 2007 , almost a year after her initial ovarian cancer diagnosis , the patient reported the new - onset of right breast edema . 
 although she had been previously followed for the right axillary lymphadenopathy , she had recently noticed an increase in erythema , thickness , and warmth of the skin of her right breast [ fig 1 , 2 ] . 
 she was treated with a 10-day course of antibiotics , with no change in symptoms . 
 she then underwent an ultrasound of her breast that showed an ill - defined hypoechoic area in the right upper outer quadrant with multiple enlarged lymph nodes . 
 a subsequent mammogram showed scattered fibroglandular densities and an area of architectural distortion with a few small punctate calcifications . 
 her gynecologic oncologist performed a fine - needle aspiration of the breast , which showed cells consistent with adenocarcinoma . 
 she then underwent a second bilateral breast mri , which confirmed the presence of an area of heterogeneous enhancement measuring 8 x 4 cm , highly suggestive of cancer , with areas suspicious for tumoral extension to the chest wall [ fig 3 , 4 ] . 
 because of these findings , the patient was referred to a breast surgical oncologist , who performed a punch biopsy of her right breast . 
 pathologic analysis showed multiple foci of high - grade adenocarcinoma with dermal lymphatic invasion , with morphology similar to that of the previous ovarian cancer [ fig 5 ] . 
 furthermore , the breast tissue specimen immunohistochemistry results were positive for ca-125 , but negative for estrogen receptor ( er ) , progestin receptor ( pr ) , and the her-2/neu oncoprotein . upon review by our institution 's multidisciplinary tumor board , it was concluded that these results were consistent with an ovarian primary tumor . 
 breast cancer is one of the most common primary malignancies in women , yet metastatic tumors to the breast are infrequent , accounting for only 0.5% to 1.3% of breast cancer cases 1 . the most common source of metastasis to the breast is a contralateral primary breast tumor , frequently from transthoracic or lymphatic spread . 
 a study by hadju and urban involving 4,051 breast cancer patients found an overall incidence of primary gynecologic cancers metastatic to the breast of 0.17% , with only 0.07% of metastatic disease originating from a primary ovarian tumor 3 . 
 the first case report of ovarian cancer with metastasis to the breast was in 1907 by sitzenfrey 4 . 
 to date , a total of only 39 such cases have been reported in the english - language literature 5 . 
 ovarian metastasis to the breast mimicking primary inflammatory breast carcinoma is even more infrequent , with only 6 previous cases reported [ table 1 ] . 
 inflammatory metastasis to a single breast was first reported by ibach in 1964 6 , followed by 5 other case reports 2 , 4 , 7 , 8 , 9 . of note , the most recent patients , including ours , all had a diagnosis of stage iiic papillary serous adenocarcinoma . 
 in contrast to primary breast tumors , metastasis to the breast generally consists of firm , well - circumscribed , multinodular masses . 
 in addition , the masses are usually superficial and less fixed to surrounding tissues , with the overlying skin generally of normal consistency . 
 the most common form of clinical presentation ( in 85% of patients ) was a solitary tumor ; only 4% of patients had diffuse involvement 4 . 
 furthermore , the most common location was the upper outer quadrant in 62% of patients 3 . 
 metastatic tumors to the breast more frequently present as well - circumscribed , non - calcified dense masses . 
 they generally lack spiculation and microcalcifications as well as architectural distortion and other skin changes . 
 however , because of the presence of psammoma bodies associated with some ovarian cancers , microcalcifications can be seen with ovarian metastasis 3 , 10 . 
 breast metastasis from a primary ovarian tumor , however , commonly lacks a characteristic pattern , may be morphologically indistinguishable from its primary , and is associated with widespread dissemination . 
 in addition , breast metastasis from a primary ovarian tumor generally is diagnosed an average of 2 years after the initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer 2 . 
 our patient developed a markedly diffuse inflammatory process of her right breast with features consistent with inflammatory breast cancer within 1 year after her initial diagnosis . 
 histopathological analysis of breast and ovarian tumors can yield similar results . therefore , accurate differentiation is necessary , because treatment and prognosis differ significantly . 
 the most common histologic variant of ovarian cancer associated with metastatic disease to the breast is papillary serous adenocarcinoma 3 . 
 immunohistochemistry may provide additional insight into the origin of the tumor . by combining the tumor markers oc125 and ov632 , yamaski et al . 
 found a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 89% for the diagnosis of metastatic ovarian cancer 10 . 
 secondary breast involvement from an ovarian tumor suggests widespread dissemination and is associated with a poor prognosis . according to several studies , after the detection of metastatic breast disease secondary to an ovarian primary tumor , survival times ranged from 13 days to 3.5 years 2 , with most patients dying within 1 year 11 . 
 another study found a 1-year survival rate of 40% for patients with ovarian cancer who also had breast metastasis , as opposed to a 4-year survival rate of 75% for patients with primary breast cancer 12 . 
 inflammatory metastatic disease to the breast also confers a grave prognosis : patient survival ranges from 3 to 18 months ( median , 6 months ) after diagnosis of the metastasis to the breast [ table 1 ] . 
 extramammary tumors should be distinguished from primary breast tumors to avoid any unnecessary surgical procedures . 
 correct diagnosis is vital : surgical interventions for patients with secondary breast cancers are potentially both diagnostic and palliative . 
 ovarian metastasis to the breast should be treated as a systemic disease , with appropriate chemotherapeutic agents . 
 mastectomy of the breast mass is likely best reserved for patients who are unresponsive to systemic therapy and require palliation 11 . 
 although ovarian metastasis to the breast presenting as inflammatory breast cancer is rare , it should be included in the differential diagnosis for any patient with a personal history of ovarian cancer . 
 accurate differentiation is necessary because treatment differs significantly for patients with ovarian metastasis to the breast , as compared with patients with primary inflammatory breast cancer . 
 ovarian metastasis to the breast confers a poor prognosis : patient survival ranged from 3 to 18 months , with a median survival of 6 months after the diagnosis of the breast metastasis .","breast cancer one common primary malignancies women yet metastatic tumors breast infrequent accounting breast cancer cases

 in addition , the tumor was strongly positive on immunohistochemistry for ca-125 , identical to the ovarian primary .

"the program evaluation is generally classified into three types : planning , summative , and formative evaluation . 
 even though distinctions between the different types of evaluation are sometimes blurred , differentiating their intent helps us in clarifying our understanding of evaluation process ( 1 ) . 
 planning evaluation takes place before a program begins to give those involved in program development a precise understanding of the program , and it is sometimes referred to as "" pre - formative evaluation "" ( 2 ) . 
 summative evaluation is the typical and most common type of evaluation , which is conducted at the end of a program to provide decision - makers with judgements about the program 's overall merit or worth . 
 however , although necessary , it often comes too late to be much help ( 3 ) . on the other hand , 
 formative evaluation occurs during the process of a program to provide those who are responsible ongoing information about whether things are going as planned and whether expected progress is being made . if not , this same information can be used to guide necessary improvements , before it is too late ( 4 ) . 
 even though there is a great extent of literature on formative evaluation , most of them mainly focus on its conceptual framework , methodology and use . 
 surprisingly , the subsequent effect of using the findings of formative evaluation has not received systematic attention , and few researches demonstrate this by comparing data from the initial program with the final program to show whether there was an improvement in program implementation and impacts ( 5 ) . 
 this study aimed to evaluate the subsequent effect of the formative program evaluation based on a case study of a clinical training program in lao people 's democratic republic ( pdr ) . 
 the main health care delivery system of lao pdr is a government - controlled , public system which has a strong vertical structure with three levels : central , provincial , and district level ( 6 ) . 
 even though all health care professionals in the country are required by law to continuously improve their knowledge and skills , the continuing professional development ( cpd ) training system in lao pdr has not yet been functioning well ( 7 ) . in 2012 , under the support of korea international cooperation agency ( koica ) , faculties from seoul national university ( snu ) college of medicine in korea and university of health sciences ( uhs ) in lao pdr launched the "" continuing professional development training project to strengthen the capacity of provincial and district hospitals in lao pdr "" ( 8) . at the beginning of the project , uhs faculties conducted a needs assessment survey in luang prabang province , which was the pilot area for this project . 
 based on the needs assessment results , korean and lao faculties worked together to develop a cpd training program and a handbook including 80 clinical topics on 5 major clinical specialties : internal medicine , surgery , obstetrics and gynecology , pediatrics , and emergency medicine . 
 and then , uhs faculties provided a 1-week ' training of trainers ' program for 30 medical faculties of the luang prabang provincial hospital . 
 also , the training management committee composed of provincial hospital executives and department chairs was established to monitor and manage the training effectively . 
 finally , the trained provincial hospital faculties provided a 10-week training program in the provincial hospital for the district hospital health professionals in luang prabang province . 
 the training was conducted 4 times consecutively over 2 yr , and 12 medical professionals , 1 from each district hospital , were invited to each training program . among the total 48 medical professionals , 35 of them were medical assistants , and the other 13 were medical doctors . 
 the training was composed of 5 major clinical sections , and the trainees rotated each clinical section every 2 weeks . 
 lecture about clinical topics , observation of trainers ' performance , and trainee 's own medical practice with trainers ' feedback were the main training methods . 
 formative program evaluation was conducted during the whole process to continuously improve the training program ( fig . 
 1 ) . kirkpatrick model was applied for the program evaluation covering level 1 ( reaction ) and level 3 ( transfer ) ( 9 ) . 
 questionnaire survey and focus group interviews with the trainees were used to evaluate the reaction of the trainees . 
 the questionnaire was designed by the co - work of faculties from snu and uhs based on the literature review ( 1011 ) . 
 it was composed of 14 items , regarding the goals and objectives , relevance , organization , trainers ' knowledge , trainers ' communication , trainers ' preparedness , training methods , discussion and interaction , practical session , handbook , facilities , schedule , applicability , and helpfulness of the training program . 
 the trainees were asked to rate the items with a 5-point likert scale ( 1 , strongly disagree ; 2 , disagree ; 3 , neutral ; 4 , agree ; 5 , strongly agree ) ( table 1 ) . 
 the survey was conducted every two weeks at the end of each clinical section of the training program . 
 focus group interview with the trainees was facilitated by the uhs faculties at the end of each 10-week training program . 
 the transfer of the trainees was evaluated through the review of medical records written by the trainees . 
 total 354 medical records written by 44 trainees before and 3 months after the training program were collected . 
 global rating with a 5-point anchored scale ( 1 , novice ; 2 , advanced beginner ; 3 , intermediate ; 4 , proficient ; 5 , expert ) was used for the evaluation . 
 a total of 25 trainers received a half - day workshop before assessing the medical records , and they practiced with some pilot medical records and received feedback during the workshop . 
 the medical records were coded by the coordinator , and they were randomly distributed to the trainers without any personal and time information . 
 the difference of average scores between the medical records written before the training and those written after the training was calculated to evaluate the transfer of the trainees . 
 the evaluation data was collected under the responsibility of the training management committee and analyzed by the study team . 
 the results were shared with the committee and the trainers after the end of each batch of the training program . 
 the committee and the trainers reached a consensus on how to improve the training program through the group discussion based on the evaluation results . 
 after the final end of the training program , the average scores of the survey results and the achievement of global rating scores of medical records among the four batches were analyzed statistically with the anova using spss . 
 the institutional review board of seoul national university college of medicine and seoul national university hospital exempted review of this study since it was an analysis of de - identified data ( irb no . 
 the institutional review board of seoul national university college of medicine and seoul national university hospital exempted review of this study since it was an analysis of de - identified data ( irb no . 
 according to the results of the survey , the trainees were quite satisfied with the training program ( table 2 ) . 
 however , especially in the early period of the training program , the trainees were not so satisfied in such areas as the organization and schedule of the training program , and discussion , interaction , and practical sessions during the training program . from the second batch , 
 there was continuous increase of the satisfaction of the trainees in all the items of the questionnaire , and most of the significant improvement happened between the first and the second batch ( supplementary fig . 
 the focus group interviews provided similar but more in - depth view of the trainees ' reactions ( table 3 ) . 
 however , especially at the first batch of the training , some trainees suggested that there should be more practice and interaction in the training program and the trainers should pay more attention and provide more explanation to the trainees . from the second batch of the training , comments about the program and 
 the trainers became more positive , and there was less criticism about the issues that were previously mentioned . in the second batch , some trainees suggested that the training should be more applicable to the situation of district hospitals , which also seemed to be improved from the third batch of the training program . 
 the average global rating scores of the medical records which were written after the training program were higher than those written before the training , except the second batch ( table 4 ) . and the achievement of the average global rating scores between the medical records before the training and those after the training increased from the first batch to the last batch , especially between the second and the third batch ( supplementary fig . 
 the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the formative program evaluation , which was applied to continuously improve the training program . according to the evaluation results , there was continuous improvement of the reaction and the transfer of the trainees from the first batch to the last batch of the training program . 
 we might have a close look at the ways how the formative program evaluation contributed to the continuous improvement of the training program . at the first batch of the training program , 
 the trainees were not so satisfied in some areas like organization and schedule of the training program , and discussion , interaction , and practical sessions in the training program . 
 some trainees thought the training activities were not enough for them , and there should be more practical sessions like bed side teaching or real practice rather than lectures . 
 trainees also suggested that the trainer should pay more attention to them and there should be more discussion and interaction between the trainer and the trainees . 
 the review of the medical records written by the first batch trainees showed a minimal achievement of global rating scores . 
 these results of the formative program evaluation were shared with the committee and the trainers at the end of the first batch of the training program . 
 the committee and the trainers reached a consensus on how to improve the training program through the group discussion based on the evaluation results . 
 they decided to increase the training activities , especially practical sessions like bed side teaching and real practice under supervision . and 
 even during the lecture time , they agreed to foster more interaction and discussion between the trainers and the trainees . 
 the training management committee also emphasized to the trainers that the trainees are not young students , but experienced medical professionals . at the second batch of the training program , 
 the average scores of all the items in the survey were much increased , and there was no item which was rated below 4.0 . also the trainee 's comments , especially about the trainers , in the focus group interview became more positive than before . 
 however , the review of the medical records written by the second batch trainees did not show any achievement of global rating scores . 
 after a group discussion based on the results of the survey and focus interview , the training management committee and the trainers reached on a consensus that there still should be more practical sessions for the trainees , which later could be applicable to the medical practice in the district hospitals . at the third batch of the training program , 
 the trainees were more satisfied with the practical sessions and more trainees appreciated the applicability of the training program . and 
 the achievement of global rating scores of the medical records was much increased comparing to the first and the second batch . 
 the program evaluation results of the fourth batch showed a minimal improvement of the reaction and transfer of the trainees . 
 there were several key factors which should be noted in this study on the formative program evaluation . 
 first of all , two levels , level 1 ( reaction ) and level 3 ( transfer ) , of the kirkpatrick model were selected for the program evaluation for the reason that the reaction of the trainees should be closely related to the implementation of the training program and the transfer of the trainees could be a reliable parameter of the outcome or impact of the training program ( 12 ) . 
 second , the survey for the evaluation of the trainees ' reaction was conducted every two weeks during the training program to improve the reliability of the ratings . 
 it was to minimize the dominating effect of the trainee 's emotional experiences of both the peak and the end of the training program ( 13 ) . 
 third , focus group interviews were added to seek more deeply the problems of the training program which were discovered by the survey results . by this 
 , the quantitative evaluation using a likert scale and qualitative evaluation using focus group interviews , both of which have their relative merits ( 14 ) , were integrated into the formative program evaluation process . finally , to evaluate the transfer of the trainees , medical records which were written 3 months after the training program were collected , analyzed , and compared with those written before the training . 
 it was based on the evidence from the previous studies that most meaningful changes would take place over a longer period of time than just right after the training ( 1516 ) . 
 we were not able to assign a control group and conduct a case - control study due to the small size of the trainees group . and 
 the formative program evaluation did not cover the level 2 ( learning ) and level 4 ( result ) of the kirkpatrick model because of the feasibility and the time limit of the evaluation process . 
 further study is needed for more delicate study design and concrete results . however , even though it was a pilot clinical training program in lao pdr , the plan for the formative program evaluation was designed from the beginning of the project , and was shared with the all the participants . 
 the whole evaluation process was conducted by the lao health professionals under the guidance and support of the study team . in conclusion 
 , the results showed that the formative program evaluation contributed to the continuous improvement of the training program .

"neonatal sprague - dawley rats ( seven days old ) together with their maternal rats were obtained from a commercial breeder ( orient co. , seoul , korea ) . 
 the experimental procedures were performed in accordance with the animal care guidelines of the national institutes of health ( nih ) and the korean academy of medical sciences . 
 each animal was housed under controlled temperature ( 232 ) and lighting ( 08:00 - 20:00 ) conditions with free feeding . 
 the neonatal rats were randomly divided into five groups ( n=15 in each group ) : a control group , and four cataract - induction groups , treated with either 0 , 50 , 100 , or 200 mg / kg catechin . 
 the rats in the catechin - treatment groups received catechin ( sigma chemical co. , st . 
 louis , mo , usa ) orally once a day for ten consecutive days at the respective doses , starting five days after cataract - induction . 
 the rats in the control group and in the cataract - induction groups received an equal amount of distilled water for the same duration . 
 cataracts were induced using a previously described procedure . in brief , at ten days of postnatal age , the neonatal rats received 100 mg / kg n - methyl - n - nitrosourea ( mnu , sigma chemical co. ) intraperitoneally . just before use , mnu was dissolved in physiological saline containing 0.05% acetic acid . 
 slit - lamp biomicroscopic examination was performed on each eye to provide a morphological assessment of the degree of opacification at 15 days after cataract induction . 
 prior to the examination , mydriasis was achieved using a topical ophthalmic solution containing tropicamide with phenylephrine hydrochloride ( santen pharmaceutical , osaka , japan ) . 
 one drop of the solution was instilled in each eye every 30 minutes for 2 hours , while the animals were in a dark room . 
 after 2 hours , the eyes were examined by slit - lamp biomicroscopy at 12magnification . 
 the rats were sacrificed immediately after determination of cataract formation with slit - lamp biomicroscopy ( 15 days after cataract induction ) . 
 the animals were anesthetized using zoletil 50 ( 10 mg / kg , i.p . ; vibac laboratories , carros , france ) . at necropsy , 
 both lenses were quickly removed under a surgical microscope gl-99b - v7 ( davis , california , ca , usa ) ; a complete necropsy was performed on all animals . 
 the lenses were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde , dehydrated in graded ethanol , treated in xylene , and infiltrated and embedded in paraffin . 
 coronal sections of 5 m thickness were made using a paraffin microtome ( leica , nussloch , germany ) and were mounted on coated slides , then dried at 37 overnight on a hot plate . 
 the lenses were collected and immediately frozen at -70. the tissues were homogenized with lysis buffer containing 50 mm tris - hcl ( ph 8.0 ) , 150 mm nacl , 10% glycerol , 1% triton x-100 , 1.5 mm mgcl26h2o , 1 mm egta , 1 mm pmsf , 1 mm na2vo4 , and 100 mm naf , and then ultracentrifuged at 50,000 rpm for 1 hours . 
 protein content were measured using a bio - rad colorimetric protein assay kit ( bio - rad , hercules , ca , usa ) . 
 forty micrograms of protein was separated on sds - polyacrylamide gels and were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane . 
 mouse antibodies against actin ( 1:2000 ; santa cruz biotech , santa cruz , ca , usa ) , bax ( 1:1000 ; santa cruz biotech ) , and bcl-2 ( 1:1000 ; santa cruz biotech ) were used as primary antibodies . 
 horseradish peroxidase - conjugated anti - mouse antibodies for bax and bcl-2 ( 1:2000 ; amersham pharmacia biothech gmbh , freiburg , germany ) were used as secondary antibodies . 
 the experiment was performed in normal lab conditions at room temperature , with the exception of membrane transfer .

 several animal species experience spontaneously occurring cataract of known inheritance and offer valuable model for studying human cataract . 
 various chemicals are known to contribute to the development of cataract in animals . among these chemicals , 
 mnu , a direct - acting alkylating agent that does not require metabolic activation , is known as a cataractogenic agent in rats . 
 in addition , young animals are reported to be more susceptible to mnu than are adult animals . 
 therefore , in this study , a cataract model was constructed using a single intraperitoneal injection of nmu in rats at postnatal day 10 . 
 lens epithelial cells play a vital role in the metabolic homeostasis and maintenance of transparency in the lens , and damage to lens epithelial cells potently contributes to cataractogenesis . 
 moreover , apoptosis of lens epithelial cells has been reported to be the earliest event in the experimental formation of cataracts , such as those inducted by hydrogen peroxide and mnu . in human studies , 
 the number of tunel - positive cells is above 50% in the lens epithelium after cataract surgery . 
 in addition , caspase-3 is up - regulated and activated in the early stages of apoptosis following cataractogenesis . 
 we found that the numbers of tunel - positive and caspase 3-positive cells in the lens epithelium were significantly higher following cataract induction . 
 these findings indicate that mnu injection - induced cataracts increased apoptosis in the lens epithelium . the bcl-2 family of proteins - including bcl-2 and bcl - xl - plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis in the nervous system . 
 however , bcl-2 and bcl - xl form heterodimers with the main pro - apoptotic member bax , which can incapacitate their protective functions . 
 the bcl-2/bax balance is one of the crucial factors determining if cells undergo apoptosis , and the balance can change during cataract formation . 
 however , cataract formation increased bax expression much more than it increased bcl-2 expression . in the lens epithelium of the cataract , 
 lens cell death occurs by apoptosis , and inhibition of apoptosis can delay cataract formation . 
 it has been reported that catechins can modulate apoptosis by altering the expressions of anti - apoptotic and pro - apoptotic genes . among the constituents of catechin 
 , egcg is known to protect against oxidative stress - induced and chronic glutamate - induced apoptosis in several human cells . 
 yao et al . reported that catechin protects against mitochondria - mediated apoptosis induced by h2o2 in human lens epithelial cells through the modulation of caspases and the mapk and akt pathways . 
 we observed that catechin significantly suppressed both cataract - induced increases in dna fragmentation and caspase-3 expression in the lens epithelium in dose - dependent manners . 
 many studies have shown that egcg , the main component of catechin , inhibits the expression of pro - apoptotic genes such as bax , bad , and mdm2 , and that egcg increases the expression of anti - apoptotic genes such as bcl-2 , bcl - w , and bcl - xl . in the present study , 
 however , cataracts induced apoptosis by increasing the bax expression much more than it did the bcl-2 expression . 
 administration of catechin suppressed the expression of bax protein in a dose - dependent manner , but only slightly enhanced bcl-2 expression . 
 the ratio of bax to bcl-2 was increased by cataract formation . in contrast , catechin suppressed the ratio of bax to bcl-2 , showing that apoptosis was inhibited by catechin treatment . taken together , our results demonstrate that catechin alleviated cataract - induced apoptosis in lens epithelial cells . 
 catechin could potentially be used to delay cataractogenesis through the suppression of apoptotic cell death in the lens epithelium .","number tunel positive cells section control group section cataract induction group mm cataract induction mg kg catechin group section cataract induction mg kg catechin group section cataract induction mg kg catechin group

"preeclampsia / eclampsia ( pe ) syndrome , defined as new onset and persistent hypertension after 20 weeks of gestation in association with significant proteinuria , is a major cause of maternal - fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide . 
 the pathophysiology of pe remains incompletely understood , and anticipation and appropriate management of this disorder are frequently insufficient . 
 the prevalent pathogenic theory of pe includes the manifestation of two characteristic and sequential processes considered to be of paramount importance . 
 the first corresponds to an insufficient placentation , which drives an increase in the resistance of the uteroplacental circulation , and the second involves the maternal reaction through the activation of an inappropriate inflammatory response with a ( proposed ) globally impaired endothelial function ( ef ) . 
 structural and functional alterations in large arteries have also been reported accompanying pe syndrome [ 4 , 5 ] . 
 impaired ef and arterial damage could occur for a certain time before significant proteinuria and clinical manifestations of pe become apparent [ 3 , 6 ] . 
 thus , the possibility of identifying early subclinical endothelial dysfunction , as well as structural and/or functional arterial alterations during pregnancy , could be of value in recognizing and classifying the different hypertensive disorders of pregnancy . 
 hopefully , this will have a positive impact on the understanding of this syndrome , as well as on the appropriate and early management of these patients . 
 celermajer et al . 's technique , commonly known as flow - mediated dilation ( fmd ) , utilizes the vascular ( or vaso- ) reactivity test ( vrt ) and has become the most popular method to assess ef . 
 the vrt consists of positioning a pneumatic cuff around the upper arm and provoking an arterial occlusion for five minutes ( transient ischemia , ti ) . 
 this maneuver elicits an increase in blood flow in the brachial artery once the cuff is deflated ( i.e. , reactive hyperemia , rh ) , which subsequently stimulates endothelium to release nitric oxide ( no ) . 
 finally , locally produced no results in a dilation of the brachial artery ( assessed by b - mode ultrasound )   and a reduction of arterial stiffness ( changes in pulse wave velocity ( pwv ) assessed by mechanotransducers ) . 
 the magnitude of the arterial dilation is used as an indicator of ef , and healthy pregnant women show an enhanced vascular response evaluated by this method compared with healthy nonpregnant women [ 9 , 10 ] . 
 whereas fmd provides information about the  recruitability  of ef ( i.e. , its responsiveness to a specific stimulus ) , it does not provide information concerning basal / tonic ef ( i.e. , release of endothelial autacoids before fmd measures are initiated ) . in this context , gori et al . 
 described a novel index for assessing the response of the artery to low flow , which utilizes data obtained from the cuff occlusion period of an fmd test . 
 synonymous to fmd , the vasoconstriction observed under conditions of reduced flow has been named low - flow - mediated vasoconstriction ( l - fmc ) . 
 inclusion of l - fmc data to traditional measurement of fmd could provide additional and/or complementary information , which , they propose , may improve the detection of patients with cardiovascular disease and profile the vascular response to exercise among healthy volunteers . 
 whether the integration of l - fmc into traditional fmd studies will provide additional / complementary information among patients with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy is unknown . 
 in addition , changes in arterial stiffness assessed by means of carotid - to - radial pulse wave velocity ( pwvcr ) due to the same test ( vrt ) have been proposed as an alternative tool for the evaluation of ef [ 8 , 14 ] . 
 pwv , in particular carotid - to - femoral pwv , is recognized as the  gold standard  parameter for the evaluation of regional aortic stiffness having a wide biomedical application . a reduction in pwvcr values ( i.e. , upper limb region ) in response to vrt has been evidenced in healthy young adults , whereas a blunted reduction has been reported in pathophysiological circumstances such as hypertension   and congestive heart failure . however , the impaired ef ( which could follow hypertensive disorders of pregnancy ) can be assessed by using pwvcr changes and if it provides additional or complementary information to those of brachial diameter assessment has not been studied yet . in this context , the aims of this work were as follows : firstly , to determine noninvasive central and peripheral arterial parameters in a group of healthy and hypertensive pregnant women , through the use of validated techniques and parameters ; secondly , to determine and analyze  basal and recruitable  ef through the measurement of fmd , l - fmc , and pwvcr changes . 
 the normotensive subjects ( healthy pregnant women , hp ; n = 10 ) were recruited from the routine antenatal clinic . 
 women with preeclampsia ( pe ; n = 8) and with gestational hypertension ( gh ; 
 n = 8) were recruited from the antenatal hospital ward , where they were admitted due to mild hypertension ( 140/90 to 149/109  mmhg ) . 
 the definitions used followed the classification of the gestational hypertensive disorders , as recommended by the report of the national collaborating centre for women 's and children 's health , hypertension in pregnancy , of the national institute for health and clinical excellence . under this classification 
 , pe was defined as bp greater than 140/90  mmhg on two consecutive occasions more than 4  h apart , in combination with significant proteinuria ( > 300  mg total protein in a 24  h urine collection ) developing after 20 weeks of gestation in previously normotensive women . 
 all pe included in the study were mild in terms of the severity of the syndrome . 
 participants were asked to abstain from physical activity and vitamin supplementation for at least 4 hours prior to the examination . 
 baseline demographic data were obtained by an obstetrician during a clinical interview and laboratory samples were extracted prior to the examination . 
 the study protocol was approved by the ethics research committee of the school of medicine ( republic university , uruguay ) and all participants gave written informed consent . 
 after recompilation of clinical and laboratory data , subjects were instructed to lie in a left lateral position ( to avoid vena cava compression by the uterus ) in a temperature - controlled ( 2123c ) room , for at least 15 minutes , in order to establish stable hemodynamic conditions . heart rate ( hr ) and right brachial ( peripheral ) systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( psbp and pdbp , resp . ) were measured using an oscillometric device ( omron hem-433int oscillometric system ; omron healthcare inc . , 
 mean blood pressure ( mbp ) was derived from the standard equation usually employed at the peripheral level : mbp = pdbp + 1/3(psbp  pdbp ) . 
 the carotid - to - femoral pulse wave velocity ( pwvcf ) was measured to analyze aortic regional stiffness . to this end 
 , carotid and femoral artery waveforms were consecutively obtained with a high - fidelity applanation tonometer from the carotid and femoral regions simultaneously with continuous ecg monitoring ( sphygmocor 7.01 , atcor medical , sydney , australia ) ( figure 1 ) . 
 then , carotid - femoral propagation time ( t3 ) was determined by subtracting the time delay between the peak of r wave of the ecg recording to femoral foot of the pressure waveform ( t2 ) of the corresponding cardiac cycle and the time delay between the peaks of r wave to carotid foot of the pressure waveform ( t1 ) . 
 the algorithm utilized to detect the so - called  foot of the wave  was the intersecting tangents . 
 straight distance between the recording sites ( carotid - to - femoral distance ( c - f x ) ) was then carefully measured using tape on the body surface to reduce the influence of altered body contour in pregnancy . 
 finally , pwvcf was automatically calculated as the quotient between c - f x and t3 ( figure 1 ) . 
 the reported value of pwvcf for a subject was always the average of at least eight consecutive beats . 
 pulse wave analysis ( pwa ) was used to assess central hemodynamics as well as systemic arterial stiffness and wave reflections . for this purpose , 
 mean radial artery waveform was obtained ( through the acquisition of many cycles ) with the applanation tonometer from the wrist , and a corresponding mean ascending aortic pressure waveform was generated with a validated generalized transfer function using the same mentioned customized software ( sphygmocor 7.01 , atcor medical , sydney , australia ) . 
 the radial pulse waveform was then calibrated using the diastolic and mean arterial pressure obtained at the brachial artery . 
 central systolic , diastolic , and pulse blood pressure ( csbp , cdbp , and cpp , resp . ) , heart rate ( hr ) corrected central augmentation index ( ap / cpp  100[% ] heart rate adjusted to a hr of 75  bpm ; aix@75 ) , and amplification ratio ( ppp / cpp ) were determined with the integrated software . 
 ultrasound assessment of carotid arteries was based on the techniques and recommendations described in international consensus . 
 high - resolution b - mode ultrasound images of both ( right and left ) common carotid arteries ( ccas ) were obtained using a 10  mhz linear - array transducer connected to a portable ultrasound system ( sonosite , micromaxx , sonosite inc . 
 , 21919 30th drive se , bothell , wa 98021 , usa ) . measurements ( still images and video clips / cine loops ) were digitally stored for off - line analysis ( figure 1 ) . near and far walls were analyzed and images were obtained from anterior , lateral , and posterior angles . at first , a carotid plaque screening was performed , for which the definition used was a focal structure that encroaches into the arterial lumen of at least 0.5  mm or 50% of the surrounding intima - media thickness or demonstrated a thickness of greater than or equal to 1.5  mm . then , longitudinal views of the ccas were acquired and a video ( cine - loop ) of at least 10 seconds was recorded and stored . 
 the cimt and beat - to - beat diameter waveforms were obtained and analyzed off - line using a step - by - step border detection algorithm ( based on changes in acoustic impedance ( z ) ) , applied to each digitized image ( hemodyn-4 m software , buenos aires , argentina ) . 
 a region of 1.0  cm proximal to the carotid bulb was identified , and the far wall cimt was determined as the distance between the lumen - intima and the media - adventitia interfaces ( figure 1 ) . 
 the software performs multiple automated or semiautomated measurements along the centimeter and averages them , increasing the accuracy of the measures . the instantaneous diameter ( from the leading edge of the near wall intima - media interface to the intima - media interface of the far wall ) waveform 
 then , complementary biomechanical parameters such as peterson 's elastic modulus ( ep ) and beta stiffness - index (  ) were calculated relating these measures with central blood pressure as follows:(1)ep = csbpcdbpsddd / dd,=lncsbp / cdbpsddd / dd , where csbp , cdbp , sd , and dd are central systolic and diastolic blood pressure and carotid systolic and diastolic diameter , respectively ( figure 1 ) . 
 ep measures the ability of the arteries to change their dimensions in response to the pulse pressure caused by cardiac pulsatile ejection ( pressure change required for ( theoretic ) 100% increase in diameter ) , whereas  is considered to be relatively independent of blood pressure levels . 
 once baseline noninvasive arterial evaluation was carried out , we utilized the theoretical basis , general protocol , and methodological aspects of the vrt recommended by the guidelines for the ultrasound assessment of endothelial - dependent flow - mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery [ 7 , 18 ] . 
 for this purpose , participants were submitted to five minutes of ischemia by occluding left radial and cubital arteries using a pneumatic cuff placed around the left forearm ( just below the elbow to at least 50  mmhg above psbp ) and several parameters of vascular reactivity were measured before , during , and after ischemia ( figure 1 ) . 
 accepted methodology for the evaluation of ef (  recruitability  ) and simultaneously for pwvcr measurement ( see later ) , left brachial artery was visualized longitudinally above the antecubital crease using same high - resolution b - mode ultrasound device mentioned earlier ( sonosite ; micromaxx ; usa ) ( figure 1 ) . 
 similarly , video sequences were recorded at rest , during forearm occlusion and after cuff deflation . subsequently and similarly to the processing of carotid images , recordings were analyzed off - line using same automated step - by - step algorithm applied to each digitalized image that allows the brachial diameter waveform obtainment and fmd and l - fmc calculation . 
 brachial local stiffness ( ep and  ) was also determined by relating brachial arterial pressure and brachial diameters , as was explained earlier for carotid measurements . 
 fmd was quantified as the percentage of change in brachial dd , considering the basal levels and those measured one minute after cuff deflation:(2)fmd%=ddafter cuff deflationddbaselineddbaseline100 . 
 in addition , doppler signals were performed to acquire blood flow velocity in baseline conditions and at specific moments during the reactive hyperemia period . 
 doppler signals were used to obtain the brachial shear rate ( and its percentage of change ) , relating mean blood flow velocity ( vm ( cm / s ) ) to brachial mean diameter ( dm ) according to the following equations:(3)sr = vmdm , sr%=sr after cuff deflationsr baselinesr baseline100 . 
 sr is an estimate of shear stress without accounting for blood viscosity   and was obtained for the characterization of the endothelial stimulus . 
 noninvasive , carotid , and radial pressure waveforms were simultaneously obtained using strain gauge mechanotransducers ( motorola mpx 2050 , motorola inc . , corporate 1303 e. algonquin road , schaumburg , illinois 60196 , usa ) by placing them on the skin over the carotid and radial sites ( left hemibody ) . 
 pwvcr was determined taking into account the given distance between these arterial sites ( c - r x ) and the time delay ( t ) between the carotid and radial waveforms onset ( figure 1 ) . 
 the algorithm used for the detection of the foot waves was described and explained in previous work . 
 although a four - minute recording after cuff release was obtained , one minute after ischemia was the specific moment where the analysis was especially taken , according to previous reports [ 8 , 16 ] ( figure 2 ) . 
 pwvcr levels corresponding to baseline and to postischemia period were determined by averaging eight consecutive beats . 
 after that , percent of change of pwvcr ( with respect to basal levels ) was quantified as follows:(4)pwvcr%=pwvcrafter cuff deflationpwvcrbaselinepwvcrbaseline100.all structural and function arterial evaluations were done by the same trained operator . 
 the statistical analyses were performed using the statistical package for social sciences ( version 22.0 ) . 
 normality of the distribution of the data was examined using the shapiro - wilk test and q - q plot . 
 all data are presented as mean value ( mv )  standard deviation ( sd ) . 
 two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) was employed for the evaluation of differences in variables within and between hypertensive and control pregnant women . 
 differences in percentage of change of variables determined before and after the vrt ( arterial diameter , pwv , and shear rate ) were evaluated using two - tailed paired student 's t - test . 
 recordings were successfully obtained from all women and all studies were included in the analysis . 
 the mean duration of the studies was 1  hour approximately and they were all well tolerated ( without symptoms and/or complications ) . 
 the mean gestational age at examination of all the pregnant women was 35  3 weeks . 
 significant proteinuria in the daily urine collection could divide the group of hypertensive pregnant women in those with preeclampsia ( with significant proteinuria > 300  mg/24  hours , pe ) and those with gestational hypertension ( without or with only traces of proteinuria , gh ) . 
 maternal age , gestational age , and number of previous gestations were similar between study groups . 
 body weight and body mass index ( bmi ) were significantly higher in pe compared with hp and gh ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 uric acid levels were within normal values in hp and gh , while in pe they were abnormally increased . 
 baseline peripheral sbp , dbp , and map levels were significantly higher in pe and gh in comparison with hp ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 no peripheral bp differences were found among groups with hypertension ( gh versus pe ) . 
 in addition , pe showed higher values of csbp compared with gh ( p = 0.004 ) , without differences in cpp and cdbp . when compared with hp women , levels of csbp and cdbp in women with pe and gh were higher . aix@75 and 
 the amplification ratio , two composite measures of systemic arterial stiffness and wave reflection amplitude , were analyzed and are presented in table 2 . 
 aix@75 was significantly higher in pe with respect to gh and hp ( 24.3  5.7% versus 11.8  7.6 and 12.2  12.4% , resp . 
 no significant differences were found in this parameter between gh and hp . on the other hand , amplification ratio ( cpp / ppp ) was only statistically different between pe and gh , with pe having the lowest values . 
 when analyzing muscular peripheral arteries ( i.e. , brachial artery ) by local ( ep and  ) and regional arterial stiffness parameters ( pwvcr ) , no differences were found among groups . however , cca and aorta ( i.e. , elastic arteries ) showed meaningful differences in stiffness . 
 for example , right cca ep was significantly increased ( duplicating approximately its values ) in pe with respect to hp and gh ( p < 0.001 and p = 0.004 , resp . ) . 
 similar tendencies were noticed in  from the right cca but not reaching statistical differences , indicating that changes in carotid artery stiffness in pe and gh are pressure - dependent . on the left side , differences were observed in ep comparing pe and hp , and similar tendencies were maintained for . finally , hypertensive pregnant women showed higher values of pwvcf ( regional aortic stiffness ) compared with hp women . 
 however , no differences were found between the groups with hypertension , although women with pe had a tendency to show higher values ( p = 0.14 ) . 
 none of the groups ( hp , gh , or pe ) presented atherosclerotic plaques . 
 right , but not left , cimt was significantly elevated in pe with respect to hp women ( p = 0.010 ) . 
 taking into account the vrt ( vascular reactivity test ) , all groups evoked endothelial stimulus ( reactive hyperemia ) evaluated by changes in shear rate before and after cuff deflation ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 in addition , peak sr and sr% were the same among groups ( p = 0.86 and p = 0.39 , resp . ) ( table 3 ) . 
 no significant changes were found in heart rate or blood pressure intra- and intergroup before and after cuff deflation , ensuring stable hemodynamic conditions during the maneuver ( data not shown ) . regarding the fmd , 
 all of them showed a dilatation of the brachial artery with respect to the basal state but without statistical significance in women with pe . 
 as was expected , hp women showed quantitatively the highest fmd response ( 9.4  3.0% ; p < 0.001 ) , while women with gh and pe reached the lowest values ( 3.6  3.3% ; p = 0.021 ; 2.2  2.9% ; p = 0.081 , resp . ) . 
 fmd mean values of gh and pe compared to hp were significantly different ( p < 0.001 ) . as was mentioned above 
 one minute after the cuff deflation , pwvcr decreased only in hp ( 7.0  1.6 to 5.9  0.8  m / s , p < 0.01 ) . 
 gh showed a blunted hyperemic pwvcr response ( 7.1  0.9 to 7.0  0.8  m / s ; p = 0.627 ) , while pe showed a tendency to increase arterial stiffness ( 6.0  1.1 to 6.4  1.3  m / s ; p = 0.06 ) . 
 pwvcr percentage changes [ pwvcr ( % ) ] differed comparing hp women with women with gh ( 13.9% versus 0.9% ; p < 0.01 ) and with pe ( 13.9% versus + 7.0% ; p < 0.01 ) . 
 l - fmc of the brachial artery was different according to the pregnancy status ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 maximal vasoconstriction ( negative values ) was observed in hp women ( 7.8  3.7% , p < 0.001 ) followed by women with gh ( 4.5  2.1% , p < 0.001 ) , while women with pe did not reach significant arterial constriction during the cuff inflation ( 0.7  3.5 ; p = 0.576 ) ( table 3 ) . 
 demographic , anthropometric , and laboratory variables shown in table 1 did not significantly correlate with any of the arterial parameters . 
 in addition , there was no significant correlation between parameters of ef ( i.e. , fmd , l - fmc , and pwvcr% ) and aix@75 or amplification ratio ( data not shown ) . 
 however , a low but statistically significant correlation was found between baseline pwvcf and l - fmc ( r = 0.45 , p = 0.04 ) , without reaching statistical significance with other ef parameters . a significant correlation between fmd , 
 l - fmc , and pwvcr% was seen among these parameters in the whole study population ( figure 3 ) . 
 the present study is , to our knowledge , the first one to determine and assess simultaneously , in a group of healthy and hypertensive pregnant women , the vascular reactivity or ef by using three different but complementary methods in conjunction with the determination of central and peripheral arterial structural and functional parameters . 
 the main results of this work were as follows : ( 1 ) central aortic blood pressure and wave reflections as well as elastic ( aortic and carotid ) arteries stiffness are increased in pe , with respect to peripheral blood pressure - matched gh and hp , and ( 2 ) pe showed both resting ( l - fmc ) and recruitable ( fmd and pwvcr% ) endothelial dysfunction . among the methods that allow measurement of vascular reactivity or ef in the clinical setting , fmd has rapidly gained popularity because of its simplicity , reproducibility , and noninvasiveness [ 7 , 18 ] . 
 however , as was mentioned earlier , one important limitation of fmd is that it only provides information about the  recruitability  of ef ( i.e. , its responsiveness to a specific stimulus ) and not about concerning  resting  ef ( i.e. , release of endothelial autacoids before fmd measures are initiated ) . 
 we here analyze in hypertensive pregnant women both types of functional aspects of ef :  endothelial recruitability  through fmd and pwvcr changes and  resting endothelial tone  through l - fmc . 
 the magnitude of fmd observed in hp in response to vrt was similar to that described in previous reports [ 9 , 10 ] . 
 as it was expected , hypertensive pregnant women showed a reduction in fmd with respect to hp , in coherence with greater degrees of endothelial dysfunction [ 22 , 23 ] . 
 it is noteworthy that only pe did not reach statistical significance in the dilation of the brachial artery , obtaining a more complete blunted response . 
 although the fmd of pe was numerically lower than those from gh , this difference did not reach statistical significance . 
 this could be attributed or not attributed to the magnitude of the standards deviation of the mean due to the low sample size . 
 therefore , the vascular profile from pregnant women with gh who might develop pe could be quite similar to those women with pe . 
 however , there is a lack of information that compares fmd between groups with pe and gh and only few studies directly analyze this issue . 
 according to quinton et al . , the fmd at one minute of the cuff deflation was not different between the gh and pe in women who were not receiving any medication , while there were statistical differences between these groups when women were receiving medical treatment . 
 nevertheless , in a prospective study conducted by filho et al . , they did not find differences in fmd of the brachial artery in patients with two different forms of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy . 
 when analyzing changes in arterial stiffness due to vrt , hp showed the major reduction in pwvcr values . on the other hand , 
 women with hypertension showed not only a blunted response in pwvcr changes but also , in pe , a tendency to increase arterial stiffness one minute after the cuff deflation was evidenced . 
 indeed , by means of this method , changes of pwvcr in pe tended to be higher in comparison to gh , indicating probably greater degree of impairment of ef . 
 it is noteworthy that all participants showed the same increase in blood flow velocity with respect to basal conditions after cuff deflation (  endothelial stimulus  ) , and variables such as baseline levels of pwvcr , basal brachial diameter , blood pressure , and gestational age were similar among the groups . taking into account  resting  endothelial tone , our results show that , during cuff inflation , brachial artery responses varied between the studied groups . 
 l - fmc of the brachial artery was significant only in hp and gh , without any constriction in pe , suggesting that pe develop also basal endothelial dysfunction . 
 although l - fmc was firstly described and assessed at the radial artery , spiro et al . 
 evidenced later that this phenomenon also occurs in healthy subjects at the brachial artery and it can be measured reliably . 
 studies agree that radial artery vasoconstriction occurs during cuff inflation in nonpregnant women [ 12 , 28 , 29 ] , whereas recent studies examining the brachial diameter during occlusion demonstrate conflicting results [ 27 , 28 , 3032 ] . 
 differences in cardiovascular profile , methodological issues , and interobserver variability could explain the widely variable results . 
 l - fmc of the brachial artery in a regimen of low but not zero blood flow ( as it occurs in the radial artery ) in a level that is upstream of the occlusion site . 
 therefore , the magnitude of reduced blood flow in the brachial artery and its relationship with the basal levels ( endothelial  negative  stimulus for vasoconstriction ) should surely yield different brachial responses . 
 as it was previously reported , we found that women with pe showed marked structural and functional alterations in peripheral and central hemodynamics [ 4 , 3335 ] . 
 pe had a strong tendency to present higher values in practically all studied parameters related to central hemodynamics . 
 for instance , central sbp , aix@75 , cca ep , and pwvcf were significantly higher in pe with respect to hp . 
 we also found differences in central hemodynamics between women with hypertension , but this was not the rule as it was for pe versus hp . 
 only csbp , aix@75 , and right cca ep were markedly augmented in comparison to gh . 
 these findings were not due to differences in peripheral blood pressure , which was elevated to a similar degree in both types of hypertensive states . 
 these pieces of information analyzed together indicate that women with hypertensive disorders in pregnancy ( mainly pe ) have increased central bp overload , central arterial stiffness , and amount of wave reflections , probably related to a vasoconstriction state due to endothelial dysfunction . 
 altered central hemodynamics in pe may signify an inadequately increased left ventricle afterload and myocardial oxygen demand in the mother circulation , as well as hemodynamic disturbances transmitted to the fetal circulation . 
 blunted fmd , l - fmc , and pwvcr changes evidenced in pe are in consonance with the plasma uric acid levels that were found elevated only in this group . in previous reports , 
 hyperuricemia was associated with an increase of plasma xanthine oxidase activity and/or a reduction in antioxidant systems   related to increased formation of reactive oxygen species and endothelial dysfunction . 
 could reflect an associated overweight / obesity state , differences in na and body fluid retention by the hemodynamic overload due to the hypertensive condition , or a combination of both . 
 our results indicate that brachial artery responses to inflation and deflation of the cuff related to endothelial dynamics could share some vascular mechanism 
 . however , there are confusing results around the fmd and l - fmc correlation , with variable results depending on the analyzed artery ( brachial versus radial ) and type of physiological or pathophysiological circumstance [ 1113 , 27 ] . 
 although both l - fmc and fmd are an expression of the vascular reactivity in response to changes in blood flow , their relationship is neither conceptually simple nor mathematically linear . 
 on the other hand , when analyzing the relationship between fmd and pwvcr the analysis can also be a little more complex . according to moens and korteweg equation , pwv is determined by arterial diameter and also by the elastic modulus . 
 if post - vrt changes in pwvcr in pe and gh would have followed only the changes in brachial diameter ( fmd ) , the obtained changes in pwvcr would have shown an equal behavior to the geometrical change ( change in diameter ) . however , in accordance with the obtained values in the groups with hypertension , a dissociation among these variables was evidenced , with an increase of arterial diameter ( which would reduce the levels of pwvcr ) without significant changes in pwvcr levels ( or even a trend to increase in pe ) after the cuff deflation period . 
 this discordance between parameters behavior in response to the vrt indicates an increase in the elastic modulus in parallel with changes in the arterial diameter . 
 thus , at least in pe , we evidenced a reciprocal and simultaneous change in the vascular wall intrinsic properties and the brachial diameter . 
 an impaired response to changes in blood flow in a concrete vascular ledge ( e.g. , brachial artery ) , without simultaneous adequate change both in brachial diameter and in arterial stiffness , could have important hemodynamic consequences . at first , a reduction in the vasodilator reserve related to endothelial dysfunction as it was seen in other pathophysiological circumstances   could implicate an incapacity of the arterial system to determine an appropriate vascular adjustment against hemodynamic changes in the long ( fetal growth ) and even in the short term ( exercise , change of position , etc . ) . 
 second , an impaired capability of response to hemodynamic changes due to endothelial dysfunction could yield other functional cardiovascular alterations that was seen in pe , like increased left ventricle afterload and diastolic dysfunction . 
 this point is in consonance with altered values of central parameters found in pe mentioned above . 
 the important additional information brought by introduction changes in pwvcr and l - fmc , together with the information of central and peripheral hemodynamics , is that these variables provide information concerning a different aspect of vascular reactivity and ef , therefore complementing ( and not overlapping with ) the information provided by fmd . 
 this vascular approach may provide a more comprehensive assessment of vascular state and endothelial function in hypertensive disease of pregnancy . 
 however , our findings were statistically significant and , by definition , this indicates that the study was adequately statistically powered . 
 our technical approaches including the use of both multiple automated and semiautomated edge - detection / point software in ultrasound image and pressure wave assessment are largely operator - independent and also empower our findings . given the means of the different variables and sds observed in previous works and in the present sample , twenty - five subjects ( n = 25 ) of the total sample size ( the sum of the sizes of comparison groups ) would be required to detect a statistically significant effect of the pregnancy status with at least 80% of power . 
 there is no isolated technique which satisfies completely this purpose with enough accuracy . at the present time 
 , different combinations of clinical risk factors , biochemical markers , and doppler ultrasound of the uterine arteries are recommended . 
 the detection rate of pe using only one clinical model of screening that includes risk factors ( e.g. , nulliparity , maternal age , family history of pe , etc . ) 
 is 45.3% , while only with doppler ultrasound of uterine arteries at the second trimester it is 63.1% and with a combined approach it reaches 67.5% , with a 25% of false positive rate . 
 the clinical importance of improving detection of pe can also be stressed when confidential enquiries are analyzed , showing that in a substantial proportion of cases of fetal death due to preeclampsia a different management might have altered the outcome . 
 moreover , the evidence demonstrates that administration of antiplatelet agents ( primarily low dose of aspirin in different trials ) to well - selected women leads to a significant reduction in the risk of developing preeclampsia and its serious consequences . for these reasons , an accurate prediction of preeclampsia or early diagnosis 
 may , therefore , allow more efficient allocation of resources for monitoring and improving maternal and perinatal outcomes [ 1 , 2 ] . on the other hand , the extensive and growing information that links endothelial dysfunction / arterial damage with pathophysiology of pe motivates researchers and clinicians to evaluate arterial parameters ( including endothelial function ) in this clinical setting . 
 additionally , there is a need to count with a more comprehensive assessing ef in a patient in concrete . in that sense , 
 the inclusion of validated arterial parameters and a more complete ef evaluation in the contemporary assessment of preeclampsia into multiparametric models could improve prediction of pe . in this small study , which addresses the feasibility of measuring these parameters simultaneously , simply , and noninvasively , we found encouraging results that we believe warrant further investigation in order to contribute to the early recognition of preeclampsia . 
 this is the first study that measures and analyzes , in the same pregnant women , central and peripheral hemodynamics and ef by using different parameters that offer additional and complementary information . 
 resting and recruitable  ef from pregnant women can be assessed by using pwvcr changes and l - fmc , respectively . 
 central aortic pressure and wave reflections as well as stiffness of elastic arteries are improperly increased in pe . 
 future studies will have to determine if incorporation of these pieces of information together , assessing basal state and functional reserve or capability of response of the vascular system into multiparametric models that include clinical , obstetric , and laboratory variables and doppler ultrasound of uterine arteries , will be able to improve contemporary prediction of preeclampsia ( from healthy pregnancy and from gestational hypertension ) . 
 hopefully , this could change the clinical management and prognosis of the pregnant women with pe .","however impaired ef could follow hypertensive disorders pregnancy assessed using pwvcr changes provides additional complementary information brachial diameter assessment studied yet

 three - month - old wild - type lenses were prepared for scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) as previously described . 
 briefly , lenses were removed from enucleated mouse eyes and immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour . 
 after critical point drying , lenses were split into quarters along the anterior  posterior axis , yielding a freshly fractured surface that revealed a surface spanning a complete equatorial lens radius . 
 imaging was conducted with a phillips xl30 tmp scanning electron microscope ( fei company , eindhoven , the netherlands ) . to observe interlocking protrusions and paddles along the short sides of fiber cells , 
 freshly isolated lenses from 2-month - old tmod1 and tmod1 mice were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer , ph 7.3 , at room temperature for 48 to 72 hours . 
 each lens was properly oriented and fractured in an anterior  posterior orientation with a sharp razor blade to expose the longitudinal features of the fiber cell short sides along the anterior , equatorial , and posterior regions of the lens . 
 lens halves were then postfixed in 1% aqueous oso4 for 1 hour at room temperature , dehydrated in graded ethanol , and dried in a samdri-795 critical point dryer ( tousimis , inc . , 
 lens halves were mounted on specimen stubs and coated with gold / palladium in a hummer 6.2 sputter coater ( anatech , inc . 
 micrographs were taken with a jeol 820 scanning electron microscope at 10 kv ( jeol , tokyo , japan ) . 
 the lens nucleus was used as a reference to determine the location of images taken and to ensure that images were from comparable areas of different lenses ( i.e. , comparable regions were located based on measurements from the center outward ) . 
 freshly enucleated eyes were collected from 6-week - old mice . a small opening made at the corneal  scleral junction facilitated fixative penetration . 
 after fixation , samples were washed in pbs , cryoprotected in 30% sucrose , frozen in optimal cutting temperature ( oct ) medium ( sakura finetek , torrance , ca , usa ) , and stored at 80c until sectioning . 
 frozen sections ( 12 m thick ) were collected with a leica cm1950 cryostat ( wetzlar , germany ) . 
 prolong gold antifade reagent ( thermo fisher scientific ) was used to mount the slides , and images were collected using a zeiss lsm780 confocal microscope ( oberkochen , germany ) . 
 frozen sections with cross - sectionally oriented fiber cells near the lens equator were identified based on the thickness of the lens epithelium . 
 staining was repeated on three samples from different mice for each genotype , and representative data are shown . 
 after fixation , lenses were cut into quarters using a sharp scalpel along the anterior  posterior axis . 
 lens quarters were postfixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in pbs for 15 minutes at room temperature and then washed two times briefly with pbs . 
 lens quarters were then permeabilized and blocked using 3% normal goat serum , 3% bovine serum albumin , and 0.3% 
 then , samples were washed three times , 5 minutes per wash , with pbs . 
 lens quarters were incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 3 hours at room temperature , followed by washing ( four times , 5 minutes per wash ) with pbs .

 were collected of single fiber cells or small bundles of fibers from lens quarters using a zeiss lsm780 confocal microscope . 
 fiber cell morphology and cell location in relation to the bulk lens quarter were used to approximate the maturity of imaged fiber cells . 
 staining was repeated on at least three lenses from three different mice for each genotype , and representative data are shown . 
 z - stack confocal images were analyzed using volocity 6.3 ( perkinelmer , waltham , wa , usa ) . 
 noise reduction using the fine filter was applied to all z - stacks in all channels . 
 the extended focus function in volocity was used to flatten z - stacks into a single image . for fluorescence 
 intensity heat maps , single optical sections from z - stacks were separated into individual channels ( 16-bit grayscale images ) , and then heat maps were generated in imagej using the heatmap histogram plug - in ( http://www.samuelpean.com/heatmap-histogram/ [ in the public domain ] ) . for tortuosity and cell neck width measurements , we evaluated single optical sections of single fibers stained with rhodamine - phalloidin to outline cell contours from 9 tmod1 and 9 tmod1 mice . using imagej , we located the fiber cell edges using the find edges function and used the wand tool ( mode : legacy ; tolerance : 5.0 ) to measure the length of one of the curved edges of each fiber cell in pixels .

 three - month - old wild - type lenses were prepared for scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) as previously described . 
 briefly , lenses were removed from enucleated mouse eyes and immersed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde 2% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour . 
 after critical point drying , lenses were split into quarters along the anterior  posterior axis , yielding a freshly fractured surface that revealed a surface spanning a complete equatorial lens radius . 
 imaging was conducted with a phillips xl30 tmp scanning electron microscope ( fei company , eindhoven , the netherlands ) . to observe interlocking protrusions and paddles along the short sides of fiber cells , 
 freshly isolated lenses from 2-month - old tmod1 and tmod1 mice were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate buffer , ph 7.3 , at room temperature for 48 to 72 hours . 
 each lens was properly oriented and fractured in an anterior  posterior orientation with a sharp razor blade to expose the longitudinal features of the fiber cell short sides along the anterior , equatorial , and posterior regions of the lens . 
 lens halves were then postfixed in 1% aqueous oso4 for 1 hour at room temperature , dehydrated in graded ethanol , and dried in a samdri-795 critical point dryer ( tousimis , inc . , rockville , md , usa ) . 
 lens halves were mounted on specimen stubs and coated with gold / palladium in a hummer 6.2 sputter coater ( anatech , inc . 
 micrographs were taken with a jeol 820 scanning electron microscope at 10 kv ( jeol , tokyo , japan ) . 
 the lens nucleus was used as a reference to determine the location of images taken and to ensure that images were from comparable areas of different lenses ( i.e. , comparable regions were located based on measurements from the center outward ) . 
 freshly enucleated eyes were collected from 6-week - old mice . a small opening made at the corneal  scleral junction facilitated fixative penetration . 
 after fixation , samples were washed in pbs , cryoprotected in 30% sucrose , frozen in optimal cutting temperature ( oct ) medium ( sakura finetek , torrance , ca , usa ) , and stored at 80c until sectioning . 
 frozen sections ( 12 m thick ) were collected with a leica cm1950 cryostat ( wetzlar , germany ) . 
 prolong gold antifade reagent ( thermo fisher scientific ) was used to mount the slides , and images were collected using a zeiss lsm780 confocal microscope ( oberkochen , germany ) . 
 frozen sections with cross - sectionally oriented fiber cells near the lens equator were identified based on the thickness of the lens epithelium . 
 staining was repeated on three samples from different mice for each genotype , and representative data are shown . 
 after fixation , lenses were cut into quarters using a sharp scalpel along the anterior  posterior axis . 
 lens quarters were postfixed in 1% paraformaldehyde in pbs for 15 minutes at room temperature and then washed two times briefly with pbs . 
 lens quarters were then permeabilized and blocked using 3% normal goat serum , 3% bovine serum albumin , and 0.3% triton x-100 in pbs for 1 hour at room temperature . after blocking , 
 then , samples were washed three times , 5 minutes per wash , with pbs . 
 lens quarters were incubated in secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution for 3 hours at room temperature , followed by washing ( four times , 5 minutes per wash ) with pbs . 
 images and z - stacks with 0.2-m steps were collected of single fiber cells or small bundles of fibers from lens quarters using a zeiss lsm780 confocal microscope . 
 fiber cell morphology and cell location in relation to the bulk lens quarter were used to approximate the maturity of imaged fiber cells . 
 staining was repeated on at least three lenses from three different mice for each genotype , and representative data are shown . 
 z - stack confocal images were analyzed using volocity 6.3 ( perkinelmer , waltham , wa , usa ) . 
 noise reduction using the fine filter was applied to all z - stacks in all channels . 
 the extended focus function in volocity was used to flatten z - stacks into a single image . for fluorescence intensity heat maps , 
 single optical sections from z - stacks were separated into individual channels ( 16-bit grayscale images ) , and then heat maps were generated in imagej using the heatmap histogram plug - in ( http://www.samuelpean.com/heatmap-histogram/ [ in the public domain ] ) . for tortuosity and cell neck width measurements , we evaluated single optical sections of single fibers stained with rhodamine - phalloidin to outline cell contours from 9 tmod1 and 9 tmod1 mice . 
 using imagej , we located the fiber cell edges using the find edges function and used the wand tool ( mode : legacy ; tolerance : 5.0 ) to measure the length of one of the curved edges of each fiber cell in pixels . 
 tortuosity was calculated as the contour length of the cell edge divided by the straight end - to - end distance along the fiber measured through the center of each fiber . 
 cell neck width across each fiber at the concave region was measured using the line tool . 
 three measurements of cell neck width were averaged for each fiber cell . the average , standard error , and statistical significance were calculated and plotted in excel ( microsoft , redmond , wa , usa ) . 
 statistical significance was determined using the student 's t - test , and p values less than 0.01 were considered statistically significant . 
 classic electron microscopy studies have described the complex interface between differentiating and maturing lens fiber cells characterized by specialized membrane interdigitations , which is shown here by sem ( figs . 
 are straight with small protrusions along the short sides and balls and sockets in the middle of the broad sides ( fig . 1b , cells viewed from the short - side edge ) . 
 as fiber cells differentiate , increased small protrusions appear along their short sides ( fig . 
 1c , top - down view of the broad sides ) , with mature fiber cells developing elaborate large interlocking paddles decorated with small protrusions ( fig .

 f - actin appears along the membrane of fiber cells and is present in regions of large paddles as well as small protrusions , outlining cell contours , but the precise location of f - actin with respect to the paddles or protrusions is unclear due to the complex geometry of the membrane interfaces . for clarity , a cartoon of mature fiber cells indicating the morphologic features of mature fiber cells ( large paddles , small protrusions , valley between large paddles and base of small protrusions ) that will be discussed below is shown in figure 1h .

 scale bars : 50 m ( a ) ; 6 m ( b  d ) ; 4 m ( e  g ) . to better visualize individual fiber cell morphologies and f - actin organization at different stages of maturation located at different depths in the lens 
 mouse lenses were microdissected , decapsulated , and fixed overnight at 4c ; and after fixation , lenses were cut into quarters and postfixed before immunostaining . 
 single fiber cells as well as fiber cell bundles spontaneously detached from the bulk lens quarters during the immunostaining process , and segments up to 200 m long could be imaged by confocal microscopy . from our preparation , we observed three types of fiber cells : tightly apposed fiber cell bundles ( fig . 
 2 ) , and single lens fibers that are detached from neighboring cells ( figs . 
 immunostaining of three neighboring fiber cell segments showed that f - actin is enriched in protrusions and paddles , and that the complex morphology of this ingenious 3d zipper is well preserved in these partially separated fibers ( fig . 
 three - dimensional reconstruction of the lens fibers shows interlocking paddles and protrusions between adjacent cells ( fig . 
 while difficult to visualize in these images , each fiber cell has three sets of coordinated paddles and protrusions along the short sides , corresponding to the three vertices located on the short sides . 
 two - dimensional ( 2d ) projections of single xz planes reveal normal hexagonal fiber cell shapes with enriched f - actin along the short sides near vertices , and less intense f - actin staining along the broad sides ( figs . 
 2c ) shows smooth f - actin staining along the cell membrane , while the xz projection through a region with paddles ( fig . 
 2d ) reveals f - actin  rich regions of paddles and protrusions at their vertices ( red asterisk ) . 
 this is analogous to the view seen in a typical equatorial cross section through mature lens fibers that have undergone denucleation , 150 to 200 m from the lens capsule ( fig . 
 2e , hexagonal cell body outlined with blue dashed lines and paddles and protrusions indicated by a red asterisk ) . 
 an extended focus image of the flattened z - stack of the individual fiber cells clearly demonstrates the interlocking paddles and protrusions between adjacent cells ( fig . 
 2 g , 2h ) reveal slight gaps between the interlocking domains of adjacent cells ( green and white cells in fig . 2 g , pink and white cells in fig . 
 in favorable views of a fiber cell edge , f - actin appears more highly enriched in the small protrusions compared to paddles ( fig . 
 note that due to the 3d nature of these complex interdigitations , single optical planes do not show all of the protrusions and paddles along the short sides of each cell . 
 our results indicate that our new immunostaining method for detached single fibers faithfully preserves fiber cell morphology observed in situ by sem ( fig . 
 1 ) , thus allowing detailed studies of the proteins required for the formation and/or stability of protrusions and paddles along fiber cell vertices . 
 confocal fluorescence microscopy images ( 2d single optical planes , extended focus flattened z - stack , 3d reconstruction and cross section ) of f - actin in neighboring mature fiber cells in 6-week - old tmod1 lenses . 
 3d reconstruction of z - stacks through three neighboring fibers shows interlocking structures between adjacent cells ( a ) and coordinated paddle domains between cells of neighboring layers ( b ) ( red arrows ) . 
 dashed boxes show the level where single xz planes in ( c , d ) are derived . 
 a single 2d xz plane from the 3d reconstruction shows normal hexagonal fiber cell morphology ( c , d ) ( hexagonal cell body outlined with blue dashed lines ) with paddles and protrusions along the short side ( d ) ( red asterisk ) . 
 the f - actin staining pattern in dissociated fiber cells is similar to what is typically observed in cross sections through hexagonal mature lens fibers that have undergone denucleation ( e ) ( hexagonal cell body outlined with blue dashed lines ) , demonstrating enriched f - actin along the short sides of these fibers and in regions of paddles and protrusions ( red asterisk ) with less intense f - actin signals along the broad sides . 
 extended focus image of the flattened z - stack shows f - actin  rich interlocking paddles decorated by small protrusions along the short sides of the cells , creating a 3d zipper between adjacent cells ( f ) . 
 single xy optical sections along the anterior  posterior axis through the fiber cells ( g , h ) , where the dashed lines are drawn through the xz plane in ( c ) show interlocking domains between fibers with some separation between the cells . 
 ( 2d , single optical plane ) of f - actin in fiber cells at various depths and sem in 6-week - old ( a ) and 2-month - old ( c ) tmod1 and tmod1 lenses . 
 ( a ) diagrams of normal cortical , differentiating , and mature fiber cells are shown along the top . tmod1 and tmod1 cortical and differentiating fiber cells are straight with small f - actin protrusions along their vertices . 
 tmod1 mature fibers have large paddle domains ( asterisks ) with f - actin  rich small protrusions , while tmod1 fiber cells have f - actin  positive protrusions , but very few paddles . 
 ( b ) tmod1 mature fiber cells display a significant decrease in tortuosity ( n = 9 , * p < 0.01 ) , but the cell neck width was unaffected ( double - headed arrows in [ a ] ) between tmod1 and tmod1 lenses ( n = 9 ) . ( c ) 
 low - magnification sem with boxed regions indicating the location of higher - magnification images . 
 comparable regions are identified by measuring outward from the nucleus at the center of the lens , since some peripheral cortical fibers are lost in the sample preparation procedure . 
 tmod1 lenses have rows of mature fiber cells with coordinated paddle protrusions that are decorated by smaller protrusions of equal size and spacing . 
 scale bars : 4 m ( a ) ; 1 mm ( c ) ( low magnification left ) ; 4 m ( c ) ( high magnification ) . to investigate whether the tmod1-stablized actin cytoskeleton plays a role in the formation or stabilization of fiber cell interdigitations , we compared fiber cell morphologies and f - actin organization in single fiber cells from tmod1 and tmod1 lenses . 
 we distinguished cortical , differentiating , and mature fiber segments by their unique morphologies ( diagram in fig . 
 3a ) and by observing the location of the single fiber with respect to depth in the bulk lens quarter . 
 single optical sections reveal that f - actin is highly enriched at the fiber cell membrane and in small protrusions in all fiber cells from both tmod1 and tmod1 lenses , including cortical , differentiating , and mature single fibers ( fig . 
 tmod1 and tmod1 cortical and differentiating fibers are straight with numerous small protrusions along their vertices , and no obvious differences in f - actin or in cell morphologies are observed . 
 protrusions along cortical fibers appear finger - like , while protrusions along differentiating fibers have more obvious head and neck regions ( fig . 
 the tmod1 mature fiber cell , which has undergone denucleation ( 150250 m deep from the lens capsule ) , displays large paddle domains with small protrusions ( fig . 
 unlike cortical and differentiating fibers , which are not affected by absence of tmod1 , the tmod1 mature fiber cell lacks normal paddles despite retaining an overall undulating shape with abundant f - actin  rich small protrusions . 
 a useful metric to compare paddle formation between control and knockout mature fiber cells is the contour length of the fiber cell edge , or tortuosity , measured along the paddle contours relative to the overall fiber cell length . 
 indeed , tmod1 mature fiber cells had a statistically significant decrease in tortuosity compared to tmod1 mature fiber cells , consistent with a partial loss of large paddles ( fig . 
 3b ) to ensure that cells from a similar depth were being compared between tmod1 and tmod1 lenses and showed that there was no difference in the cell neck width . to validate the observations based on single fiber cell immunostaining 
 , we visualized fiber cell edges by classic sem of half lenses to determine whether the loss of tmod1 affects lens fiber cell interdigitations and protrusion morphologies . 
 this showed that tmod1 mature lens fibers are characterized by coordinated large paddle domains decorated by evenly spaced and sized small protrusions ( 0.51.5 m ) , as expected ( fig . 
 3c ) . similar to immunostained single fiber cells , the tmod1 mature lens fibers appear to have reduced paddles with irregularly sized and arranged smaller protrusions ( fig . 
 3c ) , although the shapes of whole individual fiber cells are difficult to assess in these sem preparations . 
 the ability to immunostain and visualize individual mature lens fiber cells provides an opportunity to investigate the actin cytoskeleton composition of protrusions versus paddles , and how loss of tmod1 and perturbations of actin - associated proteins could account for defective paddles but not small protrusions in tmod1 mature fiber cells . 
 we hypothesized that tmod1 and a subset of actin - binding proteins ( abps ) would be associated with paddles but not small protrusions , and that loss of tmod1 would affect paddle - associated abps but not protrusion - associated abps , illuminating mechanisms underlying paddle formation . 
 first , we investigated locations of tmod1 and 2-spectrin in tmod1 mature lens fiber cells as compared to tmod1 mature lens fibers by immunostaining and confocal microscopy . 
 z - stacks collected through single fibers were flattened to view and compare the morphology of tmod1 versus tmod1 cells ( fig . 
 , we observed that both tmod1 and 2-spectrin were excluded from the small protrusions and instead tended to be located along the contours of the paddle domains , where both tmod1 and 2-spectrin staining signals appeared in large bright puncta . 
 we also observed small bright 2-spectrin puncta along the membrane of the broad sides ( fig . 
 4a , center of cell ) , consistent with lens cross - section staining data in our previous study . in single optical sections through the cytoplasm of a tmod1 mature fiber , bright tmod1 and 2-spectrin puncta are located mainly in valleys between large paddle domains along the cell edges ( i.e. , regions of concave curvature ) ( figs . 4b , 4d , arrows ) . 
 in contrast , in the tmod1 mature fiber cell with aberrant and attenuated paddle contours , the bright 2-spectrin puncta along cell edges are reduced in number and now mostly dispersed in the fiber cell cytoplasm , as seen in single optical sections through the middle of the cell ( fig . 
 a heat map of 2-spectrin fluorescence intensity shows increased cytoplasmic staining signals in the knockout mature fiber cell ( fig . 
 however , there were no obvious differences in the punctate 2-spectrin staining pattern along the broad sides of tmod1 cells as compared to tmod1 cells ( fig . 
 2-spectrin puncta are also occasionally observed at the base of the f - actin  rich small protrusions along the short sides ( at the vertices ) of the tmod1 and tmod1 fibers ( figs . 
 no changes in overall f - actin staining intensity or distribution were observed , mostly likely because absence of tmod1 does not affect morphology of small protrusions where most of the f - actin is located ( fig . 
 the presence of both tmod1 and 2-spectrin puncta in valleys between large paddles in tmod1 fiber cells supports the hypothesis that tmod1 plays a role in the formation or maintenance of large paddle domains by stabilizing a spectrin  actin network normally located in these domains in mature fiber cells . 
 moreover , alterations in 2-spectrin puncta locations and distributions in tmod1 mature fibers are consistent with our previous results showing that the loss of tmod1 perturbs the spectrin network in lens fiber cells . 
 immunostaining of single mature fiber cells from 6-week - old tmod1 and tmod1 lenses for tmod1 ( green ) , f - actin ( red ) , and 2-spectrin ( blue ) . 
 the tmod1 fiber has f - actin  rich large paddle domains and small protrusions along cell vertices . 
 while the tmod1 fiber has very few paddles , f - actin  rich small protrusions are still present . 
 ( b , d ) single optical section ( 2d ) from a z - stack , showing a section through the cytoplasm of the fiber cells , with enlargements . 
 tmod1 and 2-spectrin are enriched in puncta near the cell membrane in valleys between large paddle domains in the tmod1 fiber ( arrows ) , and 2-spectrin is also enriched at the base of small protrusions in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers ( arrowheads ) . the 2-spectrin staining signal appears diffuse and cytoplasmic ( asterisks ) with fewer membrane - associated puncta in the tmod1 fiber . 
 ( c ) fluorescence intensity heat maps of 2-spectrin staining in tmod1 and tmod1 lens fibers show that 2-spectrin staining is more cytoplasmic ( asterisks ) in the tmod1 fiber . 
 scale bars : 4 m ( a  c ) ; 2 m ( d ) . 
 our new data show that tmod1 controls the morphology of large paddle domains in mature lens fibers , via stabilization of 2-spectrin associations at the base of paddle domains . 
 these domains form the vertices between mature fiber cells visualized in lens cross sections and are associated with other abps , such as -actinin , arp3 , and ezrin . therefore , we investigated whether these abps are located in the small protrusions or large paddles and whether they are disrupted in tmod1 fibers . in mouse lenses , 
 nonmuscle -actinin ( actn1 ) , a crosslinking protein for antiparallel actin filaments , has little or no staining signal in the cortical differentiating fibers , but is enriched at the short sides of mature fibers in a punctate pattern ( fig . 
 bright tmod1 and -actinin puncta are colocalized in valleys between large paddles in the mature tmod1 lens fiber ( figs . 
 5b , 5c , arrows ) , while in the absence of tmod1 , -actinin is distributed discontinuously along the entire cell membrane , even in regions with the abnormal and attenuated paddles . 
 careful examination of the -actinin  f - actin merged image reveals that the -actinin staining is now located at the bases of all the small protrusions ( fig . 
 we performed western blotting on soluble and insoluble lens protein samples to determine whether there was an increase in -actinin protein levels in knockout lenses . 
 we found no change in the amount of -actinin in tmod1 lenses compared to the control ( data not shown ) . 
 these data suggest that in control fiber cells , tmod1 may restrict assembly of -actinin  f - actin antiparallel bundles to the valleys between large paddles , promoting paddle morphogenesis . 
 by contrast , in the absence of tmod1 , there may be a global rearrangement of the f - actin , with increased -actinin on the membrane . 
 ( a ) immunostaining of frozen lens section from 6-week - old tmod1 mice for -actinin ( green ) and f - actin ( red ) . 
 the staining signal is enriched on the short sides of mature fiber cells with a punctate pattern . 
 ( b , c ) immunostaining of single mature fiber cells ( 2d , single optical plane ) from 6-week - old tmod1 and tmod1 lenses for tmod1 ( green ) , f - actin ( red ) , and -actinin ( blue ) . 
 similar to tmod1 and 2-spectrin , -actinin is enriched in large puncta in valleys between large paddle domains in the tmod1 fiber ( arrows in [ b , c ] ) . in the tmod1 fiber 
 enlargement shows that -actinin is enriched near the base of small protrusions in the tmod1 mature fiber cell ( arrowheads in [ c ] ) . 
 scale bars : 20 m ( a ) ; 4 m ( b ) ; 2 m ( c ) . 
 next , we immunostained lenses for ezrin , which links f - actin networks to the plasma membrane and fimbrin ( aka plastin ) , a small crosslinker that bundles f - actin in a parallel orientation . 
 similar to previous reports , ezrin was detected only in lens fibers , where it was enriched on the short sides of cortical fibers , especially at vertices , with more uniform membrane staining in mature lens fibers as visualized in cross sections ( fig . 
 cross sections , fimbrin was present in epithelial cells and was also associated with the membranes of both differentiating and mature fiber cells ( fig . 
 ezrin staining was continuous and colocalized with f - actin along the cell membrane in both tmod1 and tmod1 mature lens fibers ( fig . 
 ezrin also appeared to be enriched at the base of small protrusions as well as in the valleys between large paddles ( fig . 
 fimbrin was restricted to puncta at the base of small protrusions in both control and knockout cells ( figs . 
 6c , 6d , arrows ) and was not enriched in the valleys between large paddles , unlike tmod1 , 2-spectrin , and -actinin . 
 neither ezrin nor fimbrin displayed any significant changes in the absence of tmod1 , suggesting that these f - actin networks are independent of tmod1 . 
 ( a ) immunostaining of frozen lens section from 6-week - old tmod1 mice for ezrin ( green ) and f - actin ( red ) . 
 ezrin is present along the membranes of lens fiber cells and enriched at the vertices of cortical fibers and along the short sides of mature fiber cells .

 ( c , d ) immunostaining of single mature fiber cells ( 2d , single optical plane ) from 6-week - old tmod1 and tmod1 lenses for fimbrin ( green ) , f - actin ( red ) , and ezrin ( blue ) . 
 as expected , ezrin colocalizes with f - actin along the cell membrane and in interdigitations of tmod1 and tmod1 fibers . 
 interestingly , fimbrin is enriched in puncta near the base of small interlocking protrusions in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers ( arrows in [ c , d ] ) . 
 enlargements show ezrin enrichment ( arrowheads in [ d ] ) at the base of small protrusions . 
 scale bars : 20 m ( a , b ) ; 4 m ( c ) ; 2 m ( d ) . 
 immunostaining of single mature fiber cells ( 2d , single optical plane ) from 6-week - old tmod1 and tmod1 lenses for arp3 ( green ) , f - actin ( red ) , and n - cadherin ( blue ) . 
 ( a ) n - cadherin is localized along the cell membrane in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers and appears enriched along the base of protrusions and valleys between large paddles . 
 arp3 is enriched in puncta ( arrows ) near the base of small interlocking protrusions ( arrows ) in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers . 
 arp3 is also found in valleys between large paddles in the tmod1 fiber ( arrowheads ) . 
 ( b ) enlargements show that weak arp3 staining extends into small protrusions ( open triangles ) in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers . 
 arp3 puncta at the base of small protrusions are often accompanied by enriched n - cadherin staining ( arrows ) . 
 previous work hypothesized that arp2/3 may drive actin filament branching to push protrusions out of fiber cell membranes , while a pulling force on the membrane may be mediated by clathrin complexes along the membrane of the neighboring fiber . 
 arp2/3 initiates branched actin filament assembly from preexisting filaments , and activation of arp2/3 by wasp / wave family members and cortactin drives cadherin - directed actin assembly . 
 we previously demonstrated that arp3 was enriched at the vertices of cortical fiber cells visualized in cross sections where it colocalized with n - cadherin . 
 however , arp3 localization was not investigated in mature fibers , and thus we localized arp3 and n - cadherin in single mature fibers . 
 arp3 was enriched in puncta at the base of the small f - actin  rich protrusions in both control and knockout mature fibers ( fig . 
 7 , arrows ) , and arp3 puncta were also found in valleys between large paddles in the tmod1 fiber ( fig . 
 low - intensity arp3 staining can also be observed to extend into and fill small protrusions in both control and knockout fibers ( fig . 7b , open triangles ) . 
 n - cadherin staining signal was predominantly at the cell membrane with a discontinuous pattern in control and knockout cells ( figs . 7a , 7b ) . 
 this staining pattern is consistent with a recent study showing n - cadherin staining at the membranes in lens fiber cell bundles . 
 we also observed that arp3 puncta at the base of small protrusions often coincide with areas of enriched n - cadherin staining ( fig . 
 these observations would be consistent with the original hypothesis that arp3 and n - cadherin play a role in assembly of the small f - actin  rich protrusions in fiber cells . 
 however , since loss of tmod1 does not greatly affect formation of small f - actin protrusions ( figs . 
 37 ) nor alter arp3 or n - cadherin localization , fiber cell f - actin networks regulated by arp3 or n - cadherin do not appear to be associated with the tmod1-regulated f - actin networks that control paddle domain morphology . 
 classic electron microscopy studies have described the complex interface between differentiating and maturing lens fiber cells characterized by specialized membrane interdigitations , which is shown here by sem ( figs . 
 are straight with small protrusions along the short sides and balls and sockets in the middle of the broad sides ( fig . 1b , cells viewed from the short - side edge ) . 
 as fiber cells differentiate , increased small protrusions appear along their short sides ( fig .

 mouse lenses were microdissected , decapsulated , and fixed overnight at 4c ; and after fixation , lenses were cut into quarters and postfixed before immunostaining . 
 single fiber cells as well as fiber cell bundles spontaneously detached from the bulk lens quarters during the immunostaining process , and segments up to 200 m long could be imaged by confocal microscopy . from our preparation , we observed three types of fiber cells : tightly apposed fiber cell bundles ( fig . 
 2 ) , and single lens fibers that are detached from neighboring cells ( figs . 
 immunostaining of three neighboring fiber cell segments showed that f - actin is enriched in protrusions and paddles , and that the complex morphology of this ingenious 3d zipper is well preserved in these partially separated fibers ( fig . 
 three - dimensional reconstruction of the lens fibers shows interlocking paddles and protrusions between adjacent cells ( fig . 
 while difficult to visualize in these images , each fiber cell has three sets of coordinated paddles and protrusions along the short sides , corresponding to the three vertices located on the short sides . 
 two - dimensional ( 2d ) projections of single xz planes reveal normal hexagonal fiber cell shapes with enriched f - actin along the short sides near vertices , and less intense f - actin staining along the broad sides ( figs . 
 2c ) shows smooth f - actin staining along the cell membrane , while the xz projection through a region with paddles ( fig . 
 2d ) reveals f - actin  rich regions of paddles and protrusions at their vertices ( red asterisk ) . 
 this is analogous to the view seen in a typical equatorial cross section through mature lens fibers that have undergone denucleation , 150 to 200 m from the lens capsule ( fig . 
 2e , hexagonal cell body outlined with blue dashed lines and paddles and protrusions indicated by a red asterisk ) . 
 an extended focus image of the flattened z - stack of the individual fiber cells clearly demonstrates the interlocking paddles and protrusions between adjacent cells ( fig . 
 2 g , 2h ) reveal slight gaps between the interlocking domains of adjacent cells ( green and white cells in fig . 2 g , pink and white cells in fig . 
 in favorable views of a fiber cell edge , f - actin appears more highly enriched in the small protrusions compared to paddles ( fig . 
 note that due to the 3d nature of these complex interdigitations , single optical planes do not show all of the protrusions and paddles along the short sides of each cell . 
 our results indicate that our new immunostaining method for detached single fibers faithfully preserves fiber cell morphology observed in situ by sem ( fig . 
 1 ) , thus allowing detailed studies of the proteins required for the formation and/or stability of protrusions and paddles along fiber cell vertices .

 the f - actin staining pattern in dissociated fiber cells is similar to what is typically observed in cross sections through hexagonal mature lens fibers that have undergone denucleation ( e ) ( hexagonal cell body outlined with blue dashed lines ) , demonstrating enriched f - actin along the short sides of these fibers and in regions of paddles and protrusions ( red asterisk ) with less intense f - actin signals along the broad sides .

 ( a ) diagrams of normal cortical , differentiating , and mature fiber cells are shown along the top . tmod1 and tmod1 cortical and differentiating fiber cells are straight with small f - actin protrusions along their vertices . 
 tmod1 mature fibers have large paddle domains ( asterisks ) with f - actin  rich small protrusions , while tmod1 fiber cells have f - actin  positive protrusions , but very few paddles .

 comparable regions are identified by measuring outward from the nucleus at the center of the lens , since some peripheral cortical fibers are lost in the sample preparation procedure .

 scale bars : 4 m ( a ) ; 1 mm ( c ) ( low magnification left ) ; 4 m ( c ) ( high magnification ) . 
 to investigate whether the tmod1-stablized actin cytoskeleton plays a role in the formation or stabilization of fiber cell interdigitations , we compared fiber cell morphologies and f - actin organization in single fiber cells from tmod1 and tmod1 lenses . 
 we distinguished cortical , differentiating , and mature fiber segments by their unique morphologies ( diagram in fig . 
 3a ) and by observing the location of the single fiber with respect to depth in the bulk lens quarter . 
 single optical sections reveal that f - actin is highly enriched at the fiber cell membrane and in small protrusions in all fiber cells from both tmod1 and tmod1 lenses , including cortical , differentiating , and mature single fibers ( fig . 
 tmod1 and tmod1 cortical and differentiating fibers are straight with numerous small protrusions along their vertices , and no obvious differences in f - actin or in cell morphologies are observed . 
 protrusions along cortical fibers appear finger - like , while protrusions along differentiating fibers have more obvious head and neck regions ( fig . 
 the tmod1 mature fiber cell , which has undergone denucleation ( 150250 m deep from the lens capsule ) , displays large paddle domains with small protrusions ( fig . 
 unlike cortical and differentiating fibers , which are not affected by absence of tmod1 , the tmod1 mature fiber cell lacks normal paddles despite retaining an overall undulating shape with abundant f - actin  rich small protrusions . 
 a useful metric to compare paddle formation between control and knockout mature fiber cells is the contour length of the fiber cell edge , or tortuosity , measured along the paddle contours relative to the overall fiber cell length . 
 indeed , tmod1 mature fiber cells had a statistically significant decrease in tortuosity compared to tmod1 mature fiber cells , consistent with a partial loss of large paddles ( fig . 
 3b ) to ensure that cells from a similar depth were being compared between tmod1 and tmod1 lenses and showed that there was no difference in the cell neck width . to validate the observations based on single fiber cell immunostaining 
 , we visualized fiber cell edges by classic sem of half lenses to determine whether the loss of tmod1 affects lens fiber cell interdigitations and protrusion morphologies . 
 this showed that tmod1 mature lens fibers are characterized by coordinated large paddle domains decorated by evenly spaced and sized small protrusions ( 0.51.5 m ) , as expected ( fig . 
 3c ) . similar to immunostained single fiber cells , the tmod1 mature lens fibers appear to have reduced paddles with irregularly sized and arranged smaller protrusions ( fig . 
 3c ) , although the shapes of whole individual fiber cells are difficult to assess in these sem preparations . 
 the ability to immunostain and visualize individual mature lens fiber cells provides an opportunity to investigate the actin cytoskeleton composition of protrusions versus paddles , and how loss of tmod1 and perturbations of actin - associated proteins could account for defective paddles but not small protrusions in tmod1 mature fiber cells . 
 we hypothesized that tmod1 and a subset of actin - binding proteins ( abps ) would be associated with paddles but not small protrusions , and that loss of tmod1 would affect paddle - associated abps but not protrusion - associated abps , illuminating mechanisms underlying paddle formation . 
 first , we investigated locations of tmod1 and 2-spectrin in tmod1 mature lens fiber cells as compared to tmod1 mature lens fibers by immunostaining and confocal microscopy . 
 z - stacks collected through single fibers were flattened to view and compare the morphology of tmod1 versus tmod1 cells ( fig . 
 , we observed that both tmod1 and 2-spectrin were excluded from the small protrusions and instead tended to be located along the contours of the paddle domains , where both tmod1 and 2-spectrin staining signals appeared in large bright puncta . 
 we also observed small bright 2-spectrin puncta along the membrane of the broad sides ( fig . 
 4a , center of cell ) , consistent with lens cross - section staining data in our previous study . in single optical sections through the cytoplasm of a tmod1 mature fiber , bright tmod1 and 2-spectrin puncta are located mainly in valleys between large paddle domains along the cell edges ( i.e. , regions of concave curvature ) ( figs . 4b , 4d , arrows ) . 
 in contrast , in the tmod1 mature fiber cell with aberrant and attenuated paddle contours , the bright 2-spectrin puncta along cell edges are reduced in number and now mostly dispersed in the fiber cell cytoplasm , as seen in single optical sections through the middle of the cell ( fig . 
 a heat map of 2-spectrin fluorescence intensity shows increased cytoplasmic staining signals in the knockout mature fiber cell ( fig . 
 however , there were no obvious differences in the punctate 2-spectrin staining pattern along the broad sides of tmod1 cells as compared to tmod1 cells ( fig . 
 2-spectrin puncta are also occasionally observed at the base of the f - actin  rich small protrusions along the short sides ( at the vertices ) of the tmod1 and tmod1 fibers ( figs . 
 no changes in overall f - actin staining intensity or distribution were observed , mostly likely because absence of tmod1 does not affect morphology of small protrusions where most of the f - actin is located ( fig . 
 the presence of both tmod1 and 2-spectrin puncta in valleys between large paddles in tmod1 fiber cells supports the hypothesis that tmod1 plays a role in the formation or maintenance of large paddle domains by stabilizing a spectrin  actin network normally located in these domains in mature fiber cells . 
 moreover , alterations in 2-spectrin puncta locations and distributions in tmod1 mature fibers are consistent with our previous results showing that the loss of tmod1 perturbs the spectrin network in lens fiber cells . 
 immunostaining of single mature fiber cells from 6-week - old tmod1 and tmod1 lenses for tmod1 ( green ) , f - actin ( red ) , and 2-spectrin ( blue ) . 
 the tmod1 fiber has f - actin  rich large paddle domains and small protrusions along cell vertices . 
 while the tmod1 fiber has very few paddles , f - actin  rich small protrusions are still present . 
 ( b , d ) single optical section ( 2d ) from a z - stack , showing a section through the cytoplasm of the fiber cells , with enlargements . 
 tmod1 and 2-spectrin are enriched in puncta near the cell membrane in valleys between large paddle domains in the tmod1 fiber ( arrows ) , and 2-spectrin is also enriched at the base of small protrusions in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers ( arrowheads ) . the 2-spectrin staining signal appears diffuse and cytoplasmic ( asterisks ) with fewer membrane - associated puncta in the tmod1 fiber . 
 ( c ) fluorescence intensity heat maps of 2-spectrin staining in tmod1 and tmod1 lens fibers show that 2-spectrin staining is more cytoplasmic ( asterisks ) in the tmod1 fiber . 
 scale bars : 4 m ( a  c ) ; 2 m ( d ) . 
 our new data show that tmod1 controls the morphology of large paddle domains in mature lens fibers , via stabilization of 2-spectrin associations at the base of paddle domains . 
 these domains form the vertices between mature fiber cells visualized in lens cross sections and are associated with other abps , such as -actinin , arp3 , and ezrin . therefore , we investigated whether these abps are located in the small protrusions or large paddles and whether they are disrupted in tmod1 fibers . in mouse lenses , 
 nonmuscle -actinin ( actn1 ) , a crosslinking protein for antiparallel actin filaments , has little or no staining signal in the cortical differentiating fibers , but is enriched at the short sides of mature fibers in a punctate pattern ( fig . 
 bright tmod1 and -actinin puncta are colocalized in valleys between large paddles in the mature tmod1 lens fiber ( figs . 5b , 5c , arrows ) , 
 while in the absence of tmod1 , -actinin is distributed discontinuously along the entire cell membrane , even in regions with the abnormal and attenuated paddles 
 . careful examination of the -actinin  f - actin merged image reveals that the -actinin staining is now located at the bases of all the small protrusions ( fig . 
 we performed western blotting on soluble and insoluble lens protein samples to determine whether there was an increase in -actinin protein levels in knockout lenses . 
 we found no change in the amount of -actinin in tmod1 lenses compared to the control ( data not shown ) . 
 these data suggest that in control fiber cells , tmod1 may restrict assembly of -actinin  f - actin antiparallel bundles to the valleys between large paddles , promoting paddle morphogenesis . 
 by contrast , in the absence of tmod1 , there may be a global rearrangement of the f - actin , with increased -actinin on the membrane .

 the staining signal is enriched on the short sides of mature fiber cells with a punctate pattern . 
 ( b , c ) immunostaining of single mature fiber cells ( 2d , single optical plane ) from 6-week - old tmod1 and tmod1 lenses for tmod1 ( green ) , f - actin ( red ) , and -actinin ( blue ) . 
 similar to tmod1 and 2-spectrin , -actinin is enriched in large puncta in valleys between large paddle domains in the tmod1 fiber ( arrows in [ b , c ] ) . in the tmod1 fiber 
 enlargement shows that -actinin is enriched near the base of small protrusions in the tmod1 mature fiber cell ( arrowheads in [ c ] ) . 
 scale bars : 20 m ( a ) ; 4 m ( b ) ; 2 m ( c ) . 
 next , we immunostained lenses for ezrin , which links f - actin networks to the plasma membrane and fimbrin ( aka plastin ) , a small crosslinker that bundles f - actin in a parallel orientation . 
 similar to previous reports , ezrin was detected only in lens fibers , where it was enriched on the short sides of cortical fibers , especially at vertices , with more uniform membrane staining in mature lens fibers as visualized in cross sections ( fig . 
 cross sections , fimbrin was present in epithelial cells and was also associated with the membranes of both differentiating and mature fiber cells ( fig . 
 ezrin staining was continuous and colocalized with f - actin along the cell membrane in both tmod1 and tmod1 mature lens fibers ( fig . 
 ezrin also appeared to be enriched at the base of small protrusions as well as in the valleys between large paddles ( fig . 
 fimbrin was restricted to puncta at the base of small protrusions in both control and knockout cells ( figs . 
 6c , 6d , arrows ) and was not enriched in the valleys between large paddles , unlike tmod1 , 2-spectrin , and -actinin . 
 neither ezrin nor fimbrin displayed any significant changes in the absence of tmod1 , suggesting that these f - actin networks are independent of tmod1 . 
 ( a ) immunostaining of frozen lens section from 6-week - old tmod1 mice for ezrin ( green ) and f - actin ( red ) . 
 ezrin is present along the membranes of lens fiber cells and enriched at the vertices of cortical fibers and along the short sides of mature fiber cells .

 ( c , d ) immunostaining of single mature fiber cells ( 2d , single optical plane ) from 6-week - old tmod1 and tmod1 lenses for fimbrin ( green ) , f - actin ( red ) , and ezrin ( blue ) . 
 as expected , ezrin colocalizes with f - actin along the cell membrane and in interdigitations of tmod1 and tmod1 fibers . 
 interestingly , fimbrin is enriched in puncta near the base of small interlocking protrusions in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers ( arrows in [ c , d ] ) . 
 enlargements show ezrin enrichment ( arrowheads in [ d ] ) at the base of small protrusions . 
 scale bars : 20 m ( a , b ) ; 4 m ( c ) ; 2 m ( d ) . 
 immunostaining of single mature fiber cells ( 2d , single optical plane ) from 6-week - old tmod1 and tmod1 lenses for arp3 ( green ) , f - actin ( red ) , and n - cadherin ( blue ) . 
 ( a ) n - cadherin is localized along the cell membrane in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers and appears enriched along the base of protrusions and valleys between large paddles . 
 arp3 is enriched in puncta ( arrows ) near the base of small interlocking protrusions ( arrows ) in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers . 
 arp3 is also found in valleys between large paddles in the tmod1 fiber ( arrowheads ) . 
 ( b ) enlargements show that weak arp3 staining extends into small protrusions ( open triangles ) in tmod1 and tmod1 fibers . 
 arp3 puncta at the base of small protrusions are often accompanied by enriched n - cadherin staining ( arrows ) . 
 previous work hypothesized that arp2/3 may drive actin filament branching to push protrusions out of fiber cell membranes , while a pulling force on the membrane may be mediated by clathrin complexes along the membrane of the neighboring fiber . 
 arp2/3 initiates branched actin filament assembly from preexisting filaments , and activation of arp2/3 by wasp / wave family members and cortactin drives cadherin - directed actin assembly . 
 we previously demonstrated that arp3 was enriched at the vertices of cortical fiber cells visualized in cross sections where it colocalized with n - cadherin . 
 however , arp3 localization was not investigated in mature fibers , and thus we localized arp3 and n - cadherin in single mature fibers . 
 arp3 was enriched in puncta at the base of the small f - actin  rich protrusions in both control and knockout mature fibers ( fig . 
 7 , arrows ) , and arp3 puncta were also found in valleys between large paddles in the tmod1 fiber ( fig . 
 low - intensity arp3 staining can also be observed to extend into and fill small protrusions in both control and knockout fibers ( fig . 
 n - cadherin staining signal was predominantly at the cell membrane with a discontinuous pattern in control and knockout cells ( figs . 7a , 7b ) . 
 this staining pattern is consistent with a recent study showing n - cadherin staining at the membranes in lens fiber cell bundles . 
 we also observed that arp3 puncta at the base of small protrusions often coincide with areas of enriched n - cadherin staining ( fig . 
 these observations would be consistent with the original hypothesis that arp3 and n - cadherin play a role in assembly of the small f - actin  rich protrusions in fiber cells . 
 however , since loss of tmod1 does not greatly affect formation of small f - actin protrusions ( figs . 
 37 ) nor alter arp3 or n - cadherin localization , fiber cell f - actin networks regulated by arp3 or n - cadherin do not appear to be associated with the tmod1-regulated f - actin networks that control paddle domain morphology . 
 we have developed a novel technique to immunostain single lens fiber cells while preserving their complex morphology ; this new method has allowed us to conduct detailed investigations of the f - actin structures and abps required for the formation of the interdigitations at fiber cell vertices . 
 our study has shown that tmod1 is required for the formation of large paddles , but not small protrusions , between mature lens fiber cells . 
 these subtle changes in fiber cell morphology are correlated with decreased stiffness in tmod1 lenses at low mechanical loads , providing the first evidence for the hypothesis that fiber cell interdigitations influence lens mechanical integrity . by contrast , the tmod1 lenses with reduced paddle domains between mature lens fibers remain transparent , indicating that formation of large paddles is not required for lens transparency . while recent studies have suggested that aqp0 or ephrin - a5 may be important for normal fiber cell interdigitations , 
 aqp0 and mixed - background efna5 lenses have severe cataract phenotypes with fiber cell degeneration , which complicates interpretations and impedes further studies . 
 fortunately , the very mild phenotype in tmod1 lenses has given us an opportunity to dissect the mechanisms underlying the formation of small protrusions as compared to large paddles located at the vertices of mature lens fiber cells . 
 ( a ) during fiber cell maturation , large paddle domains with small interlocking protrusions form along the vertices of hexagonal fiber cells . 
 ( b ) tmod1 may stabilize the f - actin  spectrin network as well as -actinin  crosslinked antiparallel f - actin bundles in valleys between large paddles to maintain their structure . 
 formation of small protrusions may be facilitated by arp3-nucleated actin networks , and fimbrin - crosslinked parallel f - actin bundles at the base of protrusions , while ezrin may stabilize actin networks along the entire fiber cell membrane and n - cadherin promotes cell  cell interactions . 
 our novel immunostaining protocol for single fiber cells has yielded a wealth of new information about the proteins that control f - actin organization in small protrusions and in large paddles at the vertices of lens fiber cells ( fig . 
 actin network clearly play a key role in the formation and/or maintenance of the large paddle domains in mature lens fibers . 
 abnormal cytosolic localization of 2-spectrin in knockout single fibers extends our previous work showing that loss of tmod1 leads to disruptions in the lens fiber membrane skeleton by providing a molecular mechanism connecting the f - actin cytoskeleton to fiber cell morphology . 
 unlike loss of tmod1 alone , which leads to selective reduction of large paddle domains , we showed previously that combined loss of tmod1 and cp49 , a beaded intermediate filament protein , leads to reduction in small protrusions at the vertices of mature fiber cells , suggesting that both actin and intermediate filaments are needed for normal formation or stabilization of these smaller interdigitations . 
 interestingly , -actinin is also found in foci in the valleys between large paddles where it colocalizes with tmod1 in mature tmod1 fiber cells , suggesting that tmod1 may cap the pointed ends of actin filaments crosslinked by spectrin and/or -actinin . 
 -actinin belongs to a protein family that includes spectrin , dystrophin , and utrophin , and -actinin  crosslinked f - actin bundles can interact with myosin ii to generate contractile forces . 
 it is possible that -actinin  bundled f - actin interacts with myosin ii to generate force to push and/or pull the fiber cell membrane to create the large paddles . 
 strikingly , in tmod1 mature fiber cells , the -actinin staining signal becomes more broadly localized along the fiber cell membrane in between the small protrusions . 
 however , similar to 2-spectrin , we observe changes in the localization of -actinin without changes in the protein level . 
 this implies that -actinin may be restricted to tmod1-capped f - actin in wild - type cells but become aberrantly distributed and abnormally crosslink other f - actin populations in the absence of tmod1 . 
 since tmod1 lenses have reduced levels of tropomyosin ( tm ) , a stabilizing protein that binds along the side of f - actin and enhances tmod1 capping of actin pointed ends , and tm inhibits -actinin binding to f - actin , additional f - actin binding sites may now be available in knockout lens fibers for -actinin binding . 
 it may also be significant that the localization of -actinin in the tmod1 mature fiber cell resembles that of n - cadherin in the tmod1 mature fiber cell . 
 this suggests the possibility that expansion of -actinin  crosslinked f - actin networks at n - cadherin  mediated cell 
 cell junctions may partially compensate for loss of spectrin  actin networks , perhaps as a mechanical response , albeit being unable to assist fiber cells in forming large paddle domains . our data in the lens parallel abnormal -actinin and f - actin staining patterns in tmod1 embryonic heart muscle cells that fail to assemble myofibrils . 
 further studies will be needed to define the interactions between tmod1 and -actinin  associated f - actin , as well as the changes in -actinin and actin binding in the absence of tmod1 . 
 this work also provides the first evidence that distinct abps may selectively control the formation of small protrusions as compared to large paddles in lens fiber cells . 
 in addition to intestinal microvilli , fimbrin has been found in protrusions in other cell types , including stereocilia of the inner ear hair cells and microvilli of photoreceptors , taste receptor cells , nasal epithelial cells , and respiratory brush cells . 
 the location of fimbrin in puncta at the base , but not throughout the small f - actin  rich protrusions in single mature fiber cells , suggests that these structures are not analogous to the microvilli of other cells , where fimbrin is present along their entire length . instead 
 , fimbrin crosslinking of f - actin into rigid parallel filament bundles may help in stabilizing the small protrusions at their bases . 
 our data are also consistent with previous studies showing that the presence of fimbrin and -actinin is mutually exclusive due to the different spacings between f - actins when bundled by fimbrin or -actinin . 
 while fimbrin is found in small puncta at the base of the small protrusions in mature fiber cells , ezrin is associated with f - actin along the entire membrane of mature fiber cells , including along the membranes of small protrusions . 
 immunoprecipitation experiments have shown that an actin anchorage complex consisting of ezrin  periplakin  periaxin  desmoyokin ( eppd ) proteins is associated with moesin , spectrin , and plectin in the lens , suggesting an interaction between erm , eppd , and the spectrin  actin networks . decreased actin and spectrin protein levels and fiber cell membrane staining signals 
 are observed in periaxin knockout lenses , further indicating that the eppd complexes may function to stabilize the spectrin 
 our work strengthens the hypothesis that arp2/3 may drive the formation of small protrusions by nucleating branched f - actin networks . 
 we had expected arp3 to be enriched with f - actin within the small protrusions ; instead , we found that arp3 is predominantly enriched in bright puncta at the base of small protrusions , although dim , diffuse arp3 staining can be detected extending into small protrusions . 
 this suggests that arp2/3 nucleation of branched f - actin networks occurs predominantly near the cell membrane at the base of protrusions and paddles , and to a lesser extent within the body of the protrusion , as originally proposed . 
 notably , location of arp3 at the base of small protrusions where n - cadherin is also located implies that arp2/3 may nucleate f - actin in n - cadherin cell contacts , as previously shown for e - cadherin at cell junctions in epithelial cells . since arp3 staining is comparable between tmod1 and tmod1 mature lens fibers , tmod1 does not control arp2/3-driven f - actin branching , which is thus unlikely to play a role in formation or maintenance of the large paddle contours in mature lens fibers . 
 we observe that tmod1 , 2-spectrin , -actinin , fimbrin , and arp3 are localized to small puncta at the base of some but not all protrusions and/or paddles in mature fiber cells . 
 there are several possible reasons why proteins are not consistently localized to all protrusions and/or paddles . 
 first , since the protrusions and paddles are complex 3d structures , confocal imaging of single optical sections ( as presented here ) may miss staining signals from out - of - plane structures . 
 second , our fixation conditions may lead to variable epitope accessibility in the case of proteins that are components of dense f - actin cytoskeletal structures . 
 third , preparation of single fiber cells that dissociates fibers from tightly adhered neighboring cells may lead to small rips and tears along the membrane , leading to a loss in staining at some protrusions and paddles . 
 however , based on staining of single fibers with wheat germ agglutinin ( data not shown ) , plasma membrane continuity does not appear to be compromised by our preparation method . 
 finally , fourth , it is attractive to speculate that constant membrane remodeling occurs in lens fiber cells during differentiation and maturation , requiring dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton . 
 this notion is supported by the presence of a pool of monomeric g - actin in the lens , consistent with ongoing f - actin polymerization and depolymerization in fiber cells . 
 actin cytoskeleton reorganization is a hallmark of normal lens fiber differentiation , and there is an increase in polymerized f - actin versus monomeric g - actin in newly formed lens fibers . since our staining experiments 
 capture a single snapshot in time of protein localization , we miss the dynamic changes that may remodel the membrane . in summary , we have developed a novel technique to immunostain single lens fiber cells and have shown that tmod1 stabilizes the spectrin  actin network and -actinin  crosslinked antiparallel f - actin bundles in the valleys between large paddles to maintain their structure . on the other hand , formation of small protrusions is likely facilitated by arp3-nucleated actin networks , as well as fimbrin - crosslinked parallel f - actin bundles , which do not depend on tmod1 . 
 thus , this work reveals specific abps required for the formation of large paddles between lens fibers , and suggests that large paddles between mature fiber cells are needed for lens mechanical integrity .","mature lens fibers form large interlocking paddle domains decorated small protrusions along cell vertices

observe tmod spectrin actinin fimbrin arp localized small puncta base protrusions andor paddles mature fiber cells","purposeto elucidate the proteins required for specialized small interlocking protrusions and large paddle domains at lens fiber cell tricellular junctions ( vertices ) , we developed a novel method to immunostain single lens fibers and studied changes in cell morphology due to loss of tropomodulin 1 ( tmod1 ) , an f - actin pointed end  capping protein.methodswe investigated f - actin and f - actin  binding protein localization in interdigitations of tmod1+/+ and tmod1/ single mature lens fibers.resultsf-actinrich small protrusions and large paddles were present along cell vertices of tmod1+/+ mature fibers . in contrast , tmod1/ mature fiber cells lack normal paddle domains , while small protrusions were unaffected . in tmod1+/+ mature fibers , 
 tmod1 , 2-spectrin , and -actinin are localized in large puncta in valleys between paddles ; but in tmod1/ mature fibers , 2-spectrin was dispersed while -actinin was redistributed at the base of small protrusions and rudimentary paddles . 
 fimbrin and arp3 ( actin - related protein 3 ) were located in puncta at the base of small protrusions , while n - cadherin and ezrin outlined the cell membrane in both tmod1+/+ and tmod1/ mature fibers.conclusionsthese results suggest that distinct f - actin organizations are present in small protrusions versus large paddles . 
 formation and/or maintenance of large paddle domains depends on a 2-spectrin  actin network stabilized by tmod1 . 
 -actinin 
 crosslinked f - actin bundles are enhanced in absence of tmod1 , indicating altered cytoskeleton organization . 
 formation of small protrusions is likely facilitated by arp3-branched and fimbrin - bundled f - actin networks , which do not depend on tmod1 . 
 this is the first work to reveal the f - actin  associated proteins required for the formation of paddles between lens fibers ."
"pneumonia causes almost 1 in 5 under - five deaths worldwide and is responsible for more than 2 million deaths of children each year . 
 nigeria , with a predicated incidence of 6.1 million pneumonia cases and 0.38 episodes of pneumonia per child - year in 2008 , ranks 5th among the 15 countries with highest pneumonia burden in the world . 
 it is a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in developing countries including nigeria . in 2010 , pneumonia accounted for 868,000 deaths in under-5 children , which was 14% of all causes of deaths in children . 
 however when detected early , pneumonia can be treated with easily available medication at a low cost . 
 unfortunately , only one in five caregivers in developing countries can recognize the danger signs of pneumonia like rapid breathing and chest indrawing , and only half of children under 5 with pneumonia are taken to an appropriate healthcare provider . in a population based survey carried out in six countries in sub - saharan africa , only about 18% and 30% of children with suspected pneumonia in nigeria and ethiopia , respectively , were taken to hospital for healthcare . in a systematic review of ninety - one studies that reported recognition and/or care seeking for diarrhoea , pneumonia , and malaria in low and middle income countries ( lmics ) , it was shown that the median sensitivity of recognition of pneumonia among caregivers was low ( 45.8% ) and care seeking from community health worker for pneumonia was 4.2% . the world health organization ( who ) and unicef have recommended strengthening family 's capacity to recognize danger signs and prompt care seeking as one of the interventions for controlling pneumonia in children under five . 
 this study seeks to determine the maternal perception and care seeking behaviour concerning danger signs of childhood pneumonia . 
 it is hoped that the findings of this study will help reduce mortality from pneumonia in children and will contribute to achieving the sustainable development goal on child mortality . 
 this study was conducted in enugu state , the host town of enugu state university of science and technology . 
 it is located in south east nigeria on latitude 6 27n and longitude 7 30e . 
 enugu state is made up of 17 local government areas with its capital carved from enugu north , enugu south , and enugu east lgas . 
 the majority of the inhabitants are of igbo ethnicity , and christianity is the dominant religion . 
 the minimum monthly income is similar to the national average of 18,000 ( 90 us dollars ; national minimum wage act 2011 ) . 
 literacy rate is 66% , which is higher than the national literacy rate of 45% , and there are 955 males per 1,000 females . 
 the study was conducted over a 10-month period in 4 of the 17 local government areas ( lgas ) of enugu state . 
 the lgas were divided into rural and semiurban categories based on level of development and population in the lgas . 
 simple random sampling using balloting method was used to select 2 lgas from each category . in the second stage , 
 one community was selected from each lga using simple random sampling ( i.e. , one community from each of the two rural and two semiurban lgas ) . in each of the communities visited , through adequate mobilization using the community leaders , 
 women who were caring and/or had cared for a child in the past 2 years and consented to participate were consecutively enrolled . 
 three hundred and nineteen ( 319 ) caregivers who met the inclusion criteria and gave consent to participate were interviewed in the rural communities while one hundred and forty - seven ( 147 ) were interviewed in the semiurban communities . 
 the following sociodemographic variables of respondents were assessed : ( i ) age grouped into 2030 , 3140 , and > 40 years , ( ii ) highest educational attainment grouped into tertiary , secondary , primary , and no education , ( iii ) number of living children grouped into none , 14 , and > 4 children , and ( iv ) socioeconomic class : defined as the wealth index of the household derived using maternal and paternal highest educational attainment and occupation based on oyedeji classification . 
 pneumonia is inflammation of one or both lungs caused by variety of organisms and chemical substances characterized by cough , shortness of breath , fever and difficult breathing , cyanosis , and death in severe cases . 
 oyi  in the local igbo language and this name was used for respondents that do not understand english . the world health organization ( who ) recognizes four features as danger signs in pneumonia . 
 they include stridor , fast breathing , chest wall indrawing , and difficulty in breathing ( labored breathing ) . knowledge of danger signs of pneumonia was assessed using open ended questions based on who definition . 
 based on their responses , the respondents were grouped into no knowledge of danger signs and knowledge of at least one danger sign . also knowledge and uptake of vaccine against pneumonia 
 the respondents were grouped into  yes  for those who were aware of the danger signs and had vaccinated their children and  no  for those who had not heard about pneumonia and had not vaccinated their children . 
 health seeking behavior of respondents was assessed to determine where care was sought for a child with suspected pneumonia and the treatment given . 
 quality control check to detect errors in questionnaire administration and data recording was done by researchers on daily basis after enrollment . where there are errors detected , the interviewers were asked to clarify them accordingly with the interviewed mother or caregiver . 
 data cleaning to remove grossly incomplete and/or inconsistent data was also done by researcher assistants and the study researchers . 
 results were presented as percentages and 95% confidence intervals where appropriate . statistical significance was set at p value < 0.05 . 
 informed consent ( written ) was obtained from every mother in her own right and on behalf of her child before recruitment . 
 most of the respondents 166 ( 37.4% ) were 40 years and above while those in the 2030 and 3140 years of age bracket were 158 ( 35.6% ) and 120 ( 27.0% ) , respectively . 
 approximately half of the respondents 278 ( 49.7% ) had primary school or no formal education and 280 ( 60.1% ) in the lower socioeconomic class . 
 respondents in the middle and upper socioeconomic class made up 103 ( 22.1% ) and 83 ( 17.8% ) of respondents . 
 almost two - fifth , 166 ( 39.0% ) of the respondents , have more than 4 children and 246 ( 57.7% ) with 14 children . 
 fourteen ( 3.3% ) of the respondents had no children at all but had cared for one or more children in the past . in all , 211 children 5 years or younger of respondents with a mean age of 13.7 months were involved in the study ( table 1 ) . 
 about 95% of the respondents ( 440/464 ) had heard of pneumonia and the remaining 24 ( 5.2% ) never heard about it . when asked about the cause , 
 majority of the respondents 394 ( 88.7% ) believe pneumonia is caused by exposure to cold environment and/or ingestion of cold fluid or food while 32 ( 6.9% ) have no idea what the cause of pneumonia is . the correlation ( r ) between awareness of pneumonia and knowledge of its cause is 0.374 ( p = 0.001 ) . for respondents who proffered an answer whether correct or incorrect , source of information was via electronic media ( i.e. , radio and/or television ) in 123 ( 26.5% ) , through the internet in 6 ( 1.3% ) , and during medical counseling in 226 ( 48.7% ) respondents . 
 other sources of information include print media in 13 ( 2.8% ) , social interactions in 73 ( 15.7% ) , schools in 37 ( 8.0% ) , churches in 8 ( 1.7% ) , and others in 18 ( 3.9% ) respondents . 
 almost all 426 ( 97.7% ) of the 440 respondents who have heard of pneumonia acknowledged that it is a potentially dangerous illness that could lead to serious complications . 
 inquiry into preventive measures against pneumonia showed that the vast majority believe that adequate clothing 127 ( 49.6% ) and avoiding cold food and environment 38 ( 14.8% ) were the best strategy to prevent pneumonia . 
 other preventive measures listed by respondents include cleanliness 24 ( 9.4% ) , feeding well 14 ( 5.5% ) , drugs 11 ( 4.3% ) , vaccination 27 ( 10.5% ) , prayer 2 ( 0.8% ) , educating caregivers 3 ( 1.2% ) , and avoiding crowded areas 3 ( 1.2% ) . 
 knowledge of vaccine against pneumonia was alleged by 218 ( 46.8% ) of respondents out of which 185 ( 39.7% ) claimed they took the pneumococcal vaccine for their index child . 
 some of the reasons for nonvaccination for the 281 ( 60.3% ) respondents who did not vaccinate their child included lack of knowledge of the availability of pneumococcal vaccine ( 209/281 ; 74.3% ) , nonavailability of the vaccine in health facilities around respondents residence ( 42/281 ; 15.0% ) , religious concerns ( 8/281 ; 2.9% ) , cost of vaccination ( 12/281 ; 4.3% ) , universal concern about ineffectiveness of vaccination ( 6/281 ; 2.1% ) , and side effects ( 4/281 ; 1.4% ) . further analysis showed that only maternal education ( p = 0.00 ) and place of residence ( p = 0.02 ) were significantly associated with correct knowledge of pneumonia aetiology , knowledge of dangers signs of pneumonia ( p = 0.00 ) , and uptake of vaccination ( p = 0.01 ) against pneumonia ( table 2 ) . 
 respondents were asked to list all features that in their opinion signify danger when a child is suspected of having pneumonia . 
 fever 226 ( 20.6% ) , fast breathing 181 ( 16.5% ) , continuous cough 180 ( 16.4% ) , chest pain 67 ( 6.1% ) , and difficulty in breathing 66 ( 6.0% ) were the most listed features . 
 also listed were cold body ( i.e. , hypothermia ) 63 ( 5.7% ) , catarrh / running nose 43 ( 3.9% ) , weakness 41 ( 3.7% ) , chest wall indrawing 37 ( 3.4% ) , convulsion 33 ( 3.0% ) , and others 161 ( 14.7% ) . 
 the others included but not limited to poor suck 33 , excessive cry 28 , abdominal distension 27 , restlessness 18 , stridor , that is , noisy breathing 15 , unconsciousness 11 , vomiting 10 , watery stooling 9 , dullness of face and body 6 , and pale skin 5 ( table 3 ) . 
 information source on perceived danger signs of respondents followed almost a similar pattern as causes of pneumonia described above except that previous experience of danger signs accounted for close to half , 224 ( 48.1% ) of information source here . 
 others include electronic media in 99 ( 21.2% ) , internet in 11 ( 2.4% ) , social interaction in 10 ( 2.1% ) , medical counseling in 86 ( 18.5% ) , and others in 35 ( 7.2% ) respondents . 
 two hundred and thirty - two ( 56.3% ) of respondents have experienced their perceived danger sign of pneumonia in one or more of their children . 
 fever 123 ( 24.5% ) , continuous cough 98 ( 19.5% ) , fast breathing 75 ( 14.9% ) , cold 34 ( 6.8% ) , convulsion 22 ( 4.4% ) , and difficulty breathing 17 ( 3.4% ) top the list of the most experienced pneumonia danger signs among children of respondents ( table 3 ) . the who / unicef recognised danger signs most commonly known by respondents were fast breathing ( 60.5% ) and difficulty in breathing ( 22.1% ) while chest indrawing ( 12.4% ) and stridor , that is , noisy breathing ( 5.0% ) , were less known to respondents ( table 3 ) . 
 knowledge of at least one who / unicef recognised danger sign was seen in 304 ( 65.2% ) of respondents while knowledge of 2 , 3 , and 4 recognised danger signs was seen in 219 ( 47.0% ) , 37 ( 7.9% ) , and 22 ( 4.7% ) of respondents , respectively . 
 one hundred and sixty - two ( 34.8% ) had knowledge of none of the who / unicef danger signs . 
 just like cause and vaccine knowledge , maternal level of educational attainment ( p = 0.04 ) , and place of residence ( p = 0.00 ) were significantly associated with knowledge of the who / unicef recognised pneumonia danger signs in children among respondents ( table 2 ) . 
 sixty - four percent of the 253 that responded to the question presented to the hospital , 78 ( 30.8% ) either bought drugs over the counter or visited the patent medicine dealer for treatment , 10 ( 4.0% ) consulted the traditionalist , and 3 ( 1.2% ) took the child to the church for prayers and spiritual healing . 
 first - line treatment option in all respondents ranged from antibiotics 52 ( 20.2% ) , cough syrups 119 ( 46.3% ) , vitamin c 7 ( 0.03% ) , drug combinations 46 ( 17.9% ) [ i.e. , antibiotics + cough syrup , antibiotics + cough syrup + vitamin c , etc . 
 ] , herbal concoction 9 ( 0.04% ) , and hospital admission 24 ( 9.4% ) . 
 majority of the children 202 ( 81.1% ) recovered fully , 38 ( 15.3% ) did not survive the experience , and 9 ( 3.6% ) recovered but with complications . 
 caregivers with tertiary education ( 70.0% ) used hospitals more compared to those with secondary ( 60% ) , primary ( 68% ) , and no education ( 60% ) ( p = 0.001 ) . 
 conversely , caregivers with no formal education ( 14.0% ) and those with primary education ( 2.0% ) used traditional and/or spiritual treatment more compared to those with tertiary ( 0.0% ) and secondary school education ( 0.0% ) ( p = 0.001 ) . finally , caregivers resident in rural area compared to those resident in semiurban areas sought care in a healthcare facility more ( 65.0% versus 59.0% ) , self - medicated less ( 28.0% versus 41.0% ) , and consulted traditionalist and/or spiritualist more ( 7.0% versus 0.0% ) ( p = 0.04 ) ( table 2 ) . 
 this study investigated the knowledge of caregivers and caregivers in enugu about the aetiology and danger signs of pneumonia . 
 it also sought to determine factors that influenced the knowledge and health seeking behaviour of caregivers for their under-5 children with probable pneumonia . 
 the study showed high awareness ( 95% ) and knowledge of potential fatality of pneumonia disease ( 97.7% ) among respondents but poor knowledge of the aetiology ( 4.1% ) and danger signs of probable pneumonia . 
 a similar study in thailand also showed inadequate knowledge of danger signs ( 7% ) and causes ( 21% ) of pneumonia among respondents . 
 the relatively poorer knowledge of causes of pneumonia in this study may be related to the higher number of caregivers without any formal education ( 29.2% ) compared to 4.3% among respondents in the thailand study . 
 it was noted in that study that none of the caregivers surveyed was able to mention the four standard danger signs of childhood pneumonia and only 9.4% of the respondents knew that lower chest wall indrawing was a danger sign in childhood pneumonia . 
 it was also shown in this study that older caregivers , caregivers with higher educational attainment , and those that are resident in semiurban areas had better knowledge of the cause and danger signs of pneumonia . 
 this is hardly surprising as caregivers with these sociodemographic variables are more likely to have more experiences of childhood illnesses and/or are better informed about pneumonia . 
 it showed that caregivers with lower than tertiary education were more likely to have less knowledge on aspects of pneumonia disease . 
 the lagos study in addition showed that caregivers whose information source about pneumonia was from health personnel were more likely to have correct information on the cause of pneumonia compared to those from other sources . 
 this fact was supported by this present study which revealed that respondents who obtained their information from medical personnel were more likely to have correct knowledge of aetiology and prevention of pneumonia compared to respondents that got their information from other sources . 
 inquiries into the preventive strategies showed that majority of the respondents believed that adequate clothing and avoidance of cold food , drink , or environment prevents pneumonia disease in a child . 
 this belief which is a common misconception among many lay people in nigeria was also corroborated by the study in lagos which found that 75.6% of mothers surveyed believed that cold was the main cause of pneumonia . 
 furthermore , almost half of respondents in the present survey had knowledge of pneumonia vaccine with only 39.9% of these respondents having vaccinated their child against pneumonia . 
 similarly , only about a tenth of caregivers in our survey listed vaccination as a preventive strategy for pneumonia . 
 this low uptake rate is expected as pneumococcal vaccines , which are relatively new additions to the national immunization schedules , are not widely available in public health facilities . 
 furthermore , even when available , they are not free like other routine vaccines in nigeria . 
 higher maternal educational attainment and residence in semiurban areas were significantly associated with knowledge about pneumococcal vaccine and uptake rate among children of surveyed caregivers . 
 a study conducted in the africa center demographic site in south africa showed that caregivers with secondary and tertiary education were 1.10 and 1.09 times , respectively , more likely to uptake pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( pcv ) for their children compared to caregivers with no education . 
 it further showed that those caregivers resident in rural and periurban areas were 0.90 and 0.96 times less likely to uptake pneumococcal vaccine for their child . 
 though majority of the respondents in our study took their children to hospital on suspicion of pneumonia , nearly 40% either self - medicated and/or consulted traditionalist or spiritualist as the first line of action . 
 the finding that caregivers with lower education were more likely to engage in this behaviour is easily rationalized . 
 because these caregivers are more likely to be less informed and easily persuaded , they will more likely be influenced by advice from friends and relatives to seek nonmedical solutions for their child 's illness ( especially in the face of poverty ) . 
 it was further noted that caregivers in rural area were more likely to visit hospital , less likely to self - medicate , and also more likely to visit traditionalist and/or spiritualist compared to caregivers in urban areas . 
 it could be further rationalized that because of the easy accessibility of various category of drug stores and ease of getting drugs over the counter in urban areas caregivers tended to patronize these drug dealers and self - medicate their children during illnesses . 
 similarly , because of the traditional belief which is inherent in rural communities and poorer accessibility to healthcare facilities , it is not surprising that caregivers in rural areas may more likely seek traditional and/or spiritualist help for their child 's illness . 
 contrary to this finding , a community based comparative study in dera district of oromia regional state , ethiopia , showed that more caregivers in urban area ( 75.0% ) sought healthcare for acute respiratory tract infection in their children from healthcare institution compared to those in rural areas ( 34.4% ) . 
 although no explanation was proffered by the authors for this finding , one could speculate that the higher number of caregivers with formal education in the urban category ( 28.7% ) compared to caregivers in the rural category ( 3.6% ) may have contributed to the higher healthcare seeking behaviour among caregivers in the urban compared to those in the rural setting   unlike our study where there is no significant difference in educational attainment between caregivers ' resident in urban and rural area . 
 finally , we observed in our study that fast breathing and difficulty in breathing ( labored breathing ) were the most known and experienced who recognized danger signs among respondents . 
 this may be related to the ease of noticing these symptoms in children compared to chest wall indrawing and stridor . 
 the proportion of caregivers who had knowledge of these signs was more than what was observed in a similar study in uganda . on the other hand , fever , fast breathing , and cough were the most perceived and experienced danger sign among respondents in this study . 
 khas district of pakistan similarly noted that fever and cough ( 65.2% ) , followed by fast breathing and chest wall indrawing ( 59.4% ) , were the most perceived symptoms of pneumonia by mothers in the district . 
 as noted earlier , this may be related to the ease of picking up these symptoms in children . 
 selection bias would have resulted due to the point enrollment because prospective study participants were required to gather at a preagreed location for consenting and enrollment . household sampling and enrollment which could have significantly reduced selection bias 
 could not be done during selection of respondents in the community due to unorganized household locations and difficult terrains in some communities . also , recall bias could have led to errors in data measurement , classification , and analysis since some caregivers were interviewed on events that took place in the past . 
 this study demonstrated poor knowledge of the aetiology , danger signs , and prevention of childhood pneumonia amongst caregivers . 
 health education targeted at caregivers will enhance dissemination of information to fill this knowledge deficit and hopefully reduce morbidity and mortality from childhood pneumonia . therefore the authors intend to embark on workshops to sensitize medical personnel on the need to educate the caregivers on the danger signs and prevention of childhood pneumonia .","unfortunately one five caregivers developing countries recognize danger signs pneumonia like rapid breathing chest indrawing half children pneumonia taken appropriate healthcare provider

furthermore almost half respondents present survey knowledge pneumonia vaccine respondents vaccinated child pneumonia","background . efforts to reduce child mortality especially in africa must as a necessity aim to decrease mortality due to pneumonia . to achieve this , 
 preventive strategies such as expanding vaccination coverage are key . 
 however once a child develops pneumonia prompt treatment which is essential to survival is dependent on mothers and caregiver recognition of the symptoms and danger signs of pneumonia . methods . 
 this community based cross - sectional study enrolled four hundred and sixty - six caregivers in enugu state . 
 it aimed to determine knowledge of caregivers about danger signs of pneumonia and the sociodemographic factors that influence knowledge and care seeking behaviour of caregivers . 
 results . 
 there is poor knowledge of the aetiology and danger signs of pneumonia among caregivers . 
 higher maternal educational attainment and residence in semiurban area were significantly associated with knowledge of aetiology , danger signs , and vaccination of their children against pneumonia . 
 fast breathing and difficulty in breathing were the commonest known and experienced who recognized danger signs while fever was the commonest perceived danger sign among caregivers . 
 conclusion . 
 knowledge of danger signs and health seeking behaviour among caregivers is inadequate . 
 there is need for intensified public and hospital based interventions targeted at mothers to improve their knowledge about pneumonia ."
"cellulose , a structural carbohydrate of the plant cell wall , is an abundant and ubiquitous polymer . 
 the use of cellulose for the second generation biofuel production involves the hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass , that is , saccharification , to form simple sugar monomers for the fermentation into bioethanol [ 13 ] . 
 cellulases are the group of enzymes involved in the conversion of cellulosic substrates to fermentable sugars 
 . main members of this group include endoglucanase ( ec 3.2.1.4 ) , exoglucanase or cellobiohydrolase ( ec 3.2.1.91 ) , and -glucosidase ( ec 3.2.1.21 ) . 
 the endoglucanase hydrolyzes -1,4 bonds in cellulose molecule , whereas exoglucanase cleaves the ends to release cellobiose , and -glucosidase converts cellobiose to glucose . 
 several cellulase producing fungi such as aspergillus , rhizopus , and trichoderma species [ 6 , 7 ] and bacteria such as bacillus , clostridium , cellulomonas , thermomonospora , ruminococcus , bacteroides , erwinia , and acetivibrio species [ 810 ] have been identified . however , the isolation and characterization of novel cellulose hydrolyzing enzymes from bacteria are still a highly active research area , because bacteria have a higher growth rate than fungi , leading to greater production of enzymes . 
 also , the habitat of bacteria covers different environmental niches , which favors the existence of versatile strains such as thermophiles , psychrophiles , alkaliphiles , and acidophiles . 
 the culturable cellulase producing bacteria have been isolated from the variety of sources such as composting heaps , decaying agricultural wastes , the feces of cow   and elephant , gastrointestinal tract of buffalo and horse , soil , and extreme environments like hot - springs . 
 varga and kovler   have reported that the feed fibers were not completely converted to animal product in intensive animal farming , and 2070% undigested cellulose was carried out with feces . 
 some studies have explained that the crude fiber degradation in gut is not optimal , and the fiber content of feces is still high , which can be utilized efficiently by microbes present in the feces of the herbivores . 
 rhinoceros are presumed to have an efficient system for cellulose digestion , as its main food wild grass primarily consists of cellulose . in this study 
 , the dung of the pachyderm from kaziranga national park , assam , india , has been used as the source of cellulolytic bacteria . 
 carboxymethylcellulose ( cmc ) ( low viscosity , 50200  cp ) was procured from sigma aldrich ( st . louis , mo , usa ) . 
 medium components and congo red ( analytical grade ) were procured from hi - media pvt . ltd . , 
 the dung sample of one - horned indian rhinoceros ( rhinoceros unicornis ) was collected from its natural habitat , kaziranga national park , assam , india . 
 presterilized spatula and plastic bags were used for sample collection , and before bacterial isolation the samples were stored at 4c in ice box for approximately 12  h. dung sample ( 0.5  g ) was suspended with 50  ml 0.85% ( w / v ) sterile nacl solution in a 250  ml conical flask , which was shaken at 180  rpm for 1  h at 37c . 
 an aliquot of 100  l of each dilution was spread plated onto bushnell haas medium ( bhm )   agar plates amended with carboxymethylcellulose ( cmc ) ( ph 7.0 ) containing ( g / l ) cmc ( 10.0 ) , k2hpo4 ( 1.0 ) , kh2po4 ( 1.0 ) , mgso47h2o ( 0.2 ) , nh4no3 ( 1.0 ) , fecl36h2o ( 0.05 ) , cacl2 ( 0.02 ) , and agar ( 20.0 ) [ 19 , 20 ] . 
 the plates were incubated at 37c for 96  h. morphologically dissimilar and discrete colonies were picked from different dilution plates and streaked on separate bhm - cmc plate with grids drawn over it and incubated at 37c for 96  h. the replica plates were also prepared separately for staining . 
 the stain was poured off , and the plates were washed with 1  m nacl . 
 the isolates showing clear zone around the colonies were picked from master plate and further used for the enzyme production in liquid medium . 
 the selected cultures were maintained on nutrient agar slants containing ( g / l ) peptone ( 5.0 ) , beef extract ( 1.0 ) , yeast extract ( 2.0 ) , nacl ( 5.0 ) , and agar ( 20.0 ) . 
 the isolates , selected on the basis of plate staining method , were grown in 50  ml enzyme production medium ( at ph 7.0 ) containing the following components ( g / l ) : cmc ( 10.0 ) , k2hpo4 ( 1.0 ) , kh2po4 ( 1.0 ) , mgso47h2o ( 0.2 ) , nh4no3 ( 1.0 ) , fecl36h2o ( 0.05 ) , cacl2 ( 0.02 ) , and yeast extract ( 5.0 ) . 
 this medium is the same as the previously used medium during isolation , with the only difference of addition of yeast extract . 
 50  ml medium ( containing 2% inoculum ) was taken in 250  ml erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 37c at 180  rpm for 72  h. after every 6  h , the culture was centrifuged at 12000  g for 20  min at 4c . 
 the cell - free culture broth containing the crude enzyme was used for estimation of cmcase activity . 
 based on the higher cmcase activity ( as described later ) , an isolate ss35 ( named after its colony number ) was selected for further characterization and identification . 
 the enzyme production by the isolate ss35 was monitored with cell growth at 600  nm using uv - visible spectrophotometer ( perkin elmer , model lambda-45 ) . 
 the cmcase activity ( u / ml ) was measured by estimation of reducing sugars liberated from cmc . 
 the enzyme assay was carried out by incubating the enzyme with cmc for 15  min at 37c . the reaction mixture 
 ( 100  l ) contained 50  l of enzyme and 1.0% ( w / v ) final concentration of cmc in 50  mm phosphate buffer ( ph 7.0 ) . 
 the reducing sugar was estimated by the method of nelson and somogyi [ 23 , 24 ] . 
 the absorbance was measured at 500  nm using a uv - visible spectrophotometer ( perkin elmer , model lambda-45 ) against a blank with d - glucose as standard . 
 one unit ( u ) of cellulase activity is defined as the amount of enzyme that liberates 1  mol of reducing sugar ( glucose ) in 1  min at 37c and ph 7.0 . 
 morphological and biochemical properties of the isolate were identified , evaluated , and compared , as described in bergey 's manual of systematic bacteriology . 
 the cell morphology of the selected isolate was observed under scanning electron microscope ( leo 1430 vp , leo electron microscopy ltd . , 
 gram staining , endospore staining , and urease test were done as per standard protocol . 
 the catalase activity was determined adding few drops of 3% ( v / v ) h2o2 to 5  ml of 18  h grown culture . 
 the nitrate agar slants ( m072 , himedia ) were used to test nitrate reducing property of the isolate ss35 . 
 triple sugar iron ( tsi ) slants ( m021i , himedia ) containing three sugars , namely , glucose , lactose , and sucrose , were used for acid and h2s production test . 
 acid production after carbohydrate fermentation was detected by the visible change in color from red to yellow . 
 the temperature tolerance test was performed by growing the isolate in nutrient broth and incubating at the temperatures ranging 2050c . 
 16s rdna and partial gyrase a gene sequencing of bacterial culture were done in xcelris labs limited , ahmedabad , india . 
 the genomic dna of the isolate ss35 was extracted using qiagen dna extraction kit and purified by qiaamp dna purification kit ( qiagen ) for nucleotide sequence analysis . 
 the universal 16s rdna primer 8f ( 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 ) and 1492r ( 5 acggctaccttgttacgactt 3 ) were used for amplification of genomic dna by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) . 
 the gyra region was amplified using the primers , p - gyra - f ( 5 cagtcaggaaatgcgtacgtcctt 3 ) and p - gyra - r ( 5 caaggtaatgctccaggcattgct 3 ) . 
 the concentration of each primer in 25  l pcr reaction mixture was 10  pmol and 1x pcr master mix ( mbi fermentas ) . 
 the pcr reaction was run for 30 cycles in a thermal cycler ( eppendorf ) , and the thermal profile used for the pcr was as follows : initial denaturation at 95c for 2  min , final denaturation at 94c for 30  s , primer annealing at 52c for 30  s , and extension at 72c for 90  s. full extension of the products was ensured by running a final cycle that included extension for 10  min at 72c . 
 pcr product of 5  l from each tube was mixed with 1  l of 6x gel loading dye , and this mixture was subjected to electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose gel to confirm the targeted pcr amplification . 
 the amplified product was excised from the gel and purified using qiaamp dna purification kit ( qiagen ) . 
 the concentration of the purified dna was determined , and it was subjected to automated dna sequencing on abi 3730xl genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems , usa ) . 
 the cycle sequencing was carried out using bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit following manufacturer 's instructions . 
 the cycle sequencing was carried out in a final reaction volume of 20  l using 200  l capacity pcr tube . 
 the cycling protocol was designed for 25 cycles as follows : denaturation at 96c for 10  s , annealing at 52c for 5  s , and extension at 60c for 4  min . 
 after cycling , the extension products were purified and mixed well in 10  l of hi - di formamide . 
 eluted products were placed in a sample plate , heated at 95c for 5  min , chilled , and loaded into autosampler of the instrument . 
 both the ends of the sequences were verified with the chromatogram file , and the resulted consensus sequences were used to carry out basic local alignment search tool ( blast ) with nr database of ncbi genbank using megablast algorithm . 
 multiple sequence alignment was performed by using clustal w , and evolutionary history was inferred using the neighbor - joining method . 
 the evolutionary distances were computed using the kimura 2-parameters method , and phylogenetic analysis was carried out with mega4 . 
 among 36 isolates , 9 cellulose hydrolyzing microorganisms were screened on the basis of plate staining method . the isolates ( no . 
 21 , 24 , 25 , 28 , 31 , 32 , 34 , 35 , and 36 ) showed clear zone around colonies after staining the plates with congo red and destaining with 1  m nacl as shown in figure 1 . 
 however , plate - screening method is not quantitative because of poor correlation between enzyme activity and colony to clear zone ratio . 
 the colonies showing yellow - colored halo zones were picked from replica plate and further screened on the basis of cmcase production in liquid medium . out of 9 isolates , isolate no . 
 35 exhibited maximum cmcase activity of 0.079  u / ml ( details given in table 1 ) . 
 this value was higher than activity of cmcase produced from some known natural isolates ( expressed per ml of cell - free culture broth ) , for example , cellulomonas sp . 
 ( 0.0336  u / ml , isolated from coir retting effluents ) , micrococcus sp . 
 ( 0.0152  u / ml , isolated from coir retting effluents ) , bacillus sp .

 ( 0.0113  u / ml , isolated from sugar refinery wastewater ) , and bacillus subtilis as3 ( 0.07  u / ml , isolated from cow dung ) [ 3337 ] . 
 have reported maximum cmcase activity of 0.079  u / ml by bacillus pumilus eb3 produced in a 2  l stirred tank reactor , which was equal to the cmcase activity of the isolate in this study . 
 35 was revealed to be an efficient cmcase producer species and was designated as ss35 . 
 the growth curve of ss35 along with cmcase production profile ( figure 2 ) revealed that the enzyme production was associated with cell growth and reached maximum at late log phase . 
 slight reduction in enzyme production after 48  h could be a consequence of instability of the enzyme at 37c or the activity of proteases present in the crude enzyme solution . 
 the isolate ss35 was found to be rod - shaped cells with a width and length of 0.50.6  m and 1.51.6  m , respectively , as observed under scanning electron microscope ( figure 3 ) . 
 the isolate was found to be a gram - positive , spore forming bacterium , and it gave positive test for catalase , nitrate reduction , and starch hydrolysis , whereas negative for urease and hydrogen sulfide production . 
 the absence of black precipitate at the base of the tube indicated that hydrogen sulfide was not produced . 
 the color of tsi agar slant was turned from red to yellow , which indicated that the bacterium was able to ferment the sugars glucose , lactose , and sucrose . 
 the temperature tolerance test revealed that the isolate was able to grow at a wide temperature range 2050c . 
 the phylogenetic tree generated using 16s rdna gene sequences of the isolate ss35 showed that the bacterium has the highest homology with bacillus amyloliquefaciens 
 ab679994.1 ) ( figure 4 ) . the bacterial identification using 16s rdna gene sequence is a widely practiced technique , although with limitations for the members of closely related taxa . to overcome this limitation , 
 several studies have been done , which concluded that some protein - coding genes such as rna polymerase ( rpob ) gene , rna polymerase sigma factor ( rpod ) gene , gyrase b ( gyrb ) gene , and gyrase a ( gyra ) gene   can be used for the identification of closely related taxa , because the genetic variation in protein - coding genes are much higher . 
 chun and bae   demonstrated that the gyra sequences , code for dna gyrase subunit a , can be used for accurate identification of bacillus amyloliquefaciens and related taxa including bacillus subtilis , bacillus vallismortis , bacillus mojavensis , bacillus atrophaeus , and bacillus licheniformis . 
 therefore , in this study partial gyra gene sequences have been used for the confirmation of the result obtained from 16s rdna sequence analysis . 
 the phylogenetic analysis using partial gyra gene sequences also revealed that the isolate ss35 has the highest homology with bacillus amyloliquefaciens fzb45 ( genbank accession no . : fn662840.1 ) , as shown in figure 5 . 
 numbers at nodes of the tree are indications of the levels of bootstrap support based on a neighbor - joining analysis of 1,500 resampled datasets . 
 the 16s rdna and gyra gene sequences of the isolate b. amyloliquefaciens ss35 have been deposited in the ncbi nucleotide sequence database under the accession nos . 
 cellulose hydrolytic bacteria have been isolated from rhinoceros dung , and some potent cellulose degrading bacteria have been identified . among all cellulolytic bacteria , 
 bacterium has been identified as bacillus amyloliquefaciens ss35 on the basis of 16s rdna and partial gyrase a gene sequence analyses . 
 the cmcase production has been observed to be associated with cell growth and has maxima at the late exponential phase of growth . 
 optimization of medium composition and fermentation parameters can further increase the cellulase production from b. amyloliquefaciens ss35 . 
 these attributes also make b. amyloliquefaciens ss35 a potential candidate in solid state fermentation for cmcase production using cellulosic biomass .","isolates showing clear zone around colonies picked master plate used enzyme production liquid medium

"first described in 1910 , purtscher s retinopathy is seen in severely traumatized patients and is characterized by sudden visual loss ( purtscher 1912 ) . 
 the characteristic ophthalmoscopic findings are multiple areas scattered throughout the posterior pole of superficial retinal whitening , which appear as focal areas of retinal arteriolar occlusion on fluoresceinangiography ( grass 1997 ) . 
 similar clinical findings have been reported in association with childbirth ( blodi et al 1990 ; shaikh et al 2003 ) , and have been termed purtschers - like retinopathy . the visual prognosis in purtschers - like retinopathy after childbirth is guarded , and to date , there is no definitive treatment . 
 however , there are encouraging reports of visual recovery in patients with purtscher s retinopathy receiving high dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy ( atabay et al 2003 ) . 
 we report a patient with purtschers - like retinopathy following childbirth who received a sub - tenon s capsule injection of triamcinolone with subsequent increase in visual acuity and decrease in retinal swelling . 
 ten days after an emergent caesarian section for severe preeclampsia , rh immunization , and fetal anemia , a 24 year - old primigravida primiparus patient presented with complaints of decreased vision in both eyes , right greater than left . there were no other systemic abnormalities such as elevated liver enzymes , low platelets or other hematologic abnormalities . 
 dilated fundus examination revealed bilateral purtschers - like retinopathy ( figures 1a , 1b ) , with widespread areas of macular ischemia and edema , as confirmed by optical coherence tomography ( figures 2a , 2b ) . 
 of note are the superficial areas of high intensity signal , indicative of retinal ischemia . 
 the central thickness in the right eye was 272 microns , and in the left 239 microns . 
 a sub - tenon s injection of 0.5 cc of triamcinolone ( 40 mg / cc ) was given in the right eye on day 15 after delivery . 
 at one week following the injection , her visual acuity was unchanged and her intraocular pressure was normal . 
 she noted a marked improvement in the vision in her right eye . on examination a her acuity 
 had improved to 20/60 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left , with normal intraocular pressures . 
 her fundus examination showed marked improvement , with most of the superficial ischemic areas resolving . 
 repeat optical coherence tomography in both eyes ( figures 3a , 3b ) demonstrated a reduction in the edema of the right eye by 30% from baseline , whereas the left , untreated eye showed a reduction in swelling of 14% . 
 her visual acuity remained 20/60 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye . 
 nearly a century ago otmar purtscher described a case of visual loss in a severely traumatized patient whose exam showed multiple superficial retinal hemorrhages and white patches throughout the posterior pole . since that time , similar findings have been associated with other conditions including compressive chest injuries , acute pancreatitis , fat embolism , retro - bulbar anesthesia , connective tissue diseases ( grass 1997 ) , and childbirth ( blodi et al 1990 ; shaikh et al 2003 ) . 
 the pathogenesis of purtschers - like retinopathy post - partum is unknown , but may be related to arteriolar obstruction by complement induced leukoemboli produced during parturition ( blodi et al 1990 ) . 
 similar clinical findings have been reported in the setting of amniotic fluid embolism . however , in the absence of a patent foramen ovale or pulmonary arteriovenous - shunts , it is unlikely that amniotic emboli are the direct cause of the observed retinal arteriolar obstructions . 
 other investigators have theorized that subclinical amniotic fluid emboli may activate complement and induce granulocyte microemboli , which could occur on both sides of the pulmonary capillary bed . 
 the visual recovery of postpartum patients with purtschers - like retinopathy is varied ( blodi et al 1990 ; shaikh et al 2003 ) . of the four patients described by blodi , three enjoyed significant improvement in central acuity , 
 another case of purtscher - like retinopathy has been described in a patient with hellp syndrome during antepartum . 
 generally purtscher - like retinopathy has a favorable prognosis but this case resulted in permanent loss of vision ( stewart et al 2007 ) . 
 currently , there is no definitive treatment for postpartum purtschers - like retinopathy . in vivo 
 , corticosteroids have been shown efficacious in inhibiting complement - induced granulocyte aggregation ( hammerschimidt et al 1979 ) . 
 clinically , there are two reports of visual recovery after high dose , intravenous corticosteroid therapy in post - traumatic patients ( atabay et al 1993 ) . 
 the case presented here is unique in that the patient had bilateral , asymmetric purtschers - like retinopathy post - partum , with quantitative oct improvement following unilateral local steroid therapy .","similar clinical findings reported association childbirth blodi et al shaikh et al termed purtschers like retinopathy

"benign colorectal strictures can develop after diverticulitis , ischemic colitis , radiation colitis , or colonic resection . 
 recently , colorectal endoscopic submucosal dissection has become another possible culprit for the development of this benign stricture , which usually occurs after resection of a lateral spreading tumor , occupying 75% of the lumen . 
 anastomotic strictures after surgery , occurring in 5% to 20% of cases after low anterior resection , could be a serious condition that may require endoscopic or surgical treatment . despite this serious condition 
 , most strictures could be managed successfully with several treatment modalities , such as direct digital dilation , transanal surgical treatment , endoscopic balloon dilation , and stent insertion 
 . however , other varieties of endoscopic or surgical techniques are required in refractory strictures , especially after failure of the first endoscopic management . 
 data on refractory cases in colorectal benign strictures are limited and this will be discussed . 
 endoscopic balloon dilation has been used as a first treatment modality for the treatment of benign colorectal strictures . however , varying results have been reported with regard to the success rate of this procedure.1,2 despite its simplicity and immediate efficacy in up to 80% of cases , this technique requires several treatment sessions and is associated with a significant rate of recurrent benign stenosis . 
 predictors of a successful outcome include : a relatively narrow stenosis ( < 10 mm ) , a short segment stricture ( < 4 cm ) , and anastomotic strictures . 
 poor predictors include : numerous strictures , complete obstruction , associated fistulas within the stricture , active inflammation around the stricture , recent surgery , a tight angulation , and malignancy.3 balloons usually exert a radial vector force against the strictured tissue , and these often require sequential dilation using a larger balloon over two to three endoscopic sessions in order to achieve long - term success . 
 however , this may not be determined until the results of the first dilation are known . 
 immediate relief of symptoms has been reported in 77% of patients and long - term relief in 44% of patients.4 fifty - five patients with crohn symptomatic strictures were studied . 
 the long - term success of endoscopic balloon dilation was reported to depend on the type of strictures , their location , and their length . 
 failure of endoscopic treatment was observed in long - segment strictures in the terminal ileum.5 in one study , 55 patients with ileocolonic strictures secondary to crohn disease underwent 78 balloon dilations . 
 dilatation resulted in complete relief of obstructive symptoms in 34 patients after one or repetitive dilatations . 
 . however , four of these patients showed improvement with administration of intravenous fluid and antibiotics.6 balloon dilatation is more useful in patients with anastomotic strictures . in one study , 
 endoscopic dilatation in 94 patients with postoperative anastomotic stenosis was successful in 59% of patients who underwent resection for cancer and in 88% who underwent resection for a benign condition . 
 high success and low risk rates make endoscopic balloon dilatation the treatment of choice to avoid high risk of reoperation in patient with benign anstomoticstrictures.2 placement of a self - expandable metal stent ( sems ) has been suggested as one of therapeutic modalities for the relief of benign colorectal strictures.7 unlike uncovered stents , fully covered sems has several advantages in the management of benign strictures . 
 these fully covered sems have limited local tissue reaction ; thus , they are used in benign conditions such as colonic strictures , fistulas , perforation , and leaks in the digestive tract.8,9 permanent insertion of sems is also associated with a significant and unacceptable rate of complications , such as new stricture formation and perforation . only a few studies have reported on the usefulness of fully covered sems in patients with benign colorectal strictures . 
 one recent study , which included 43 patients with symptomatic strictures , reported on the effectiveness of fully covered sems in the management of benign colorectal strictures . 
 the efficacy of the stent , technical success , stent retrieval , safety , and recurrence of symptoms were evaluated during the follow - up . 
 the authors insisted that fully covered sems is safe and effective for treatment of symptomatic benign strictures , despite a high rate of spontaneous migration.10 although this study could not define the predictive risk factors for clinical success or recurrence , refractory patients who underwent several balloon dilation sessions were successfully managed . 
 conduct of future studies will be needed in order to define the best treatment option , such as balloon dilation vs. early fully covered sems insertion . 
 biodegradable stents have recently been developed for use in the management of refractory benign esophageal strictures . 
 the poly - l - lactic based stent and polydiosanone based stent were mainly used for refractory benign esophageal strictures . in particular , 
 a polydiosanone stent is a semicrystalline , biodegradable polymer , which degrades by random hydrolysis and at low ph . 
 the prolonged dilatory effect before stent absorption and the progressive stent degradation could represent a favorable solution for patients with benign strictures refractory to standard dilation therapy compared with self - expandable metal and plastic stents for esophageal strictures.11,12 currently , use of biodegradable stents in the management of colorectal refractory benign strictures , same as benign esophageal strictures , has been attempted . 
 treatment of 10 patients with postsurgical colorectal strictures ( n=7 ) and fistula ( n=3 ) with biodegradable polydiosanone stents was an effective alternative in short to medium terms . 
 the fistulas were successfully closed in all patients . among the six patients who received stents for strictures , symptoms resolved in five ; in the remaining patients , the stent migrated shortly after the endoscopy . if biodegradable stents are to be used for the treatment of strictures and fistulas , the proximity of the stricture should be close to the anus because of the inflexibility , and the need to fix stents in the colon was important.13 in another study , 11 patients with postsurgical benign strictures located within 20 cm from the anal verge , refractory to mechanical or pneumatic dilation ( at least three sessions ) were included . 
 the overall success rate of the biodegradable stent was 45%.14 treatment using biodegradable stents in the management of refractory anastomotic colorectal stricture is very safe . 
 they concluded that , instead of a nondedicated biodegradable stent which carried a high migration risk , dedicated stents with a large diameter and antimigration findings could improve the outcome of patients with refractory benign colorectal stricture .

 most benign colorectal strictures could be managed with several sessions of balloon dilation or fully covered sems insertion . 
 several studies have reported on the use of combined endoscopic or a novel method other than these techniques . 
 variable therapeutic options continue to evolve and have taken much of their lead from the treatment of refractory benign esophageal strictures . 
 a combined technique of endoscopic electroincision using the tip of a polypectomy snare or papillotome and balloon dilatation was used in 36 patients with benign colorectal anastomotic strictures . 
 recurrence of the stricture was found in only five of these patients at 1-year follow - up , and all were treated successfully by further balloon dilatation.15 the other combined modality was used at the completely obstructed anastomosis stricture . a puncture catheter ( polyethylene catheter ) with a needle and a flexible metallic sheath at the distal end could penetrate the central obstructed anastomosis stricture under endoscopic and fluoroscopic control . 
 the guide - wire was passed through the catheter and pneumatic dilatation was then performed . 
 more expandable dilatation was performed repeatedly for successful web destruction.16 another study also reported that endoscopic reanastomosis in a sigmoid cancer patient with a completely strictured colorectal anastomosis was performed successfully using a transrectal puncture needle and wire guided balloon dilatation.17 a novel hybrid technique using transanal endoscopic microsurgery ( tem ) and balloon dilation for the treatment of a benign complete colorectal anastomotic stricture has been reported.18 the stricture was incised with a vessel - sealing device using a 20-cm tem rectoscope . 
 tem - assisted balloon strictureplasty could be a minimally invasive solution for bridging the gap between radical surgery and conservative treatment . 
 in refractory benign strictures involved around the rectum , electrocautery can be performed via flexible sigmoidoscopy using a urologic resectoscope19 or by tem with balloon dilatation . 
 laser ablation has also been reported for the treatment of strictures.20 one study reported the use of tem combined with a nd : yag laser for resection of an anastomotic stricture.21 dilation of the stricture using tem can be achieved at the same time as resection . 
 novel endoscopic techniques are emerging for the management of refractory benign colorectal strictures ; these would be of great help in the management of patients who suffered from strictures . 
 endoscopic dilation of colonic strictures offers many advantages over surgical management , including preservation of intestinal length . 
 the procedure for balloon dilatation is quick , simple , and can be easily controlled by endoscopists . 
 repeat dilations are often necessary , and the number of repeated dilations seems to vary between two and three or more . if a trial of several balloon dilatations fails , the patient will need an alternative modality . 
 it is safe and effective for the treatment of refractory benign colonic strictures , despite a high rate of spontaneous migration . in particular , 
 the biodegradable stent is very safe and does not need to be retrieved because it will be degraded naturally with tissue reaction . 
 combined investigational modality can also be considered if only one modality like balloon or sems can not be performed due to a poor situation ( e.g. , numerous strictures ) . 
 wire guided balloon dilation after use of a puncture needle , eletroincision , and tem using balloon dilatation and combined techniques could be attempted . 
 these different treatments suggest that a single method is not adequate for all refractory benign colorectal strictures . 
 what is important is that the etiology and pathogenesis behind colorectal stricture should be analyzed , given the success rate of a nonoperative intervention method . 
 finally , surgical treatment is reserved for patients who fail all endoscopic remediation or those are not candidates for endoscopic treatment ( fig .","endoscopic balloon dilation used first treatment modality treatment benign colorectal strictures

"pseudomonas aeruginosa has become the most common gram - negative bacterial species associated with serious hospital - acquired infections [ 1 , 2].mortality rates outbreaks from p. aeruginosa in burn units can be significantly high ( 60% ) .immediate use of effective antimicrobial therapy for p. aeruginosa bacteremia has been shown to significantly reduce mortality . 
 however , the intrinsic resistance of p. aeruginosa to many antimicrobial agents and , in addition , the variety of their increasingly recognized acquired resistance mechanisms make their management in the hospital setting problematic . of great concern 
 is the growing emergence of multidrug - resistant ( mdr ) strains of p. aeruginosa [ 69 ] , and the severity of associated infections . 
 unfortunately , the development of new antibiotics with activity against gram - negative organisms has not kept pace with the increase in prevalence of multidrug resistant pathogens . to provide clinicians with credible alternative treatments to reduce the increasing human mortality and morbidity associated with the infectious diseases by drug - resistant bacterial pathogens 
 , there is a compelling need to develop new therapeutic agents that are effective against drug - resistant mutants . 
 structurally , nubiotics are synthetic nucleotides and oligonucleotides with nuclease - resistant backbones , and are fully protonated . 
 although the exact mechanisms of antibiotic actions for nubiotics are not totally understood , they are thought to be indeed different from that of the traditional antimicrobial drugs and the protonated structures are believed , in part , to make nubiotics to be taken up by bacterial cells more easily . as a family , nubiotics has many members , including nu-2 , nu-3 , nu-4 , and nu-5 , which have been shown to have effective therapeutic effect in the burn wound pseudomonas aeruginosa infection model established in mice . nu-3 
 [ butyl - phosphate-5-thymidine-3-phosphate - butyl ] is a potent nubiotics that is a fully protonated deoxynucleotide . 
 the therapeutic efficacy of nu-3 against pulmonary pseudomonas aeruginosa infection was evaluated in vivo animal model ,   in which liposome - encapsulated nu-3 presented efficacious antibacterial activity .           to further assess nu-3 as a potential new antibiotic for topical uses , we performed studies for its acute , multiple - dose dermal toxicity and the irritation to skin and eyes and genetic toxicity . 
 these studies have revealed that nu-3 has hypotoxicity at high dosage , and it has no chronic toxicity and irritation . 
 this study provides solid data to warrant further development of nubiotics as a novel class of antimicrobial agents for treating pseudomonas aeruginosa infection . 
 balb / c mice and sprague - dawley rats used in this study were purchased from beijing vital river company . 
 the body weight ranged from 1720  g for mice and 250300  g for rats . 
 all the test animals were randomized into groups after being quarantined for 35 days before experiments . 
 randomly , the body weight variation was within 20% of the mean weight in each sex . 
 all the mice and rats were housed in a room with a temperature of 2025c , a relative humidity of 40%70% , and a 12-hour - light / dark cycle . 
 the use and care of the animals followed the regulations for the administration of affairs concerning experimental animals in china ( 11 - 14 - 1988 ) . 
 chinese hamster ovary cells ( cho and cho - k1 ) were purchased from cell culture center , peking union medical university . 
 cho - k1 cells were grown in dmem / f-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum ( fbs ) , 2  mm l - glutamine , and penicillin - streptomycin ( 100  units / ml , 100  g / ml ) . 
 mice were intragastrically administered with a total dose of 2500 , 1988 , 1580 , 1256 , and 1000  mg / kg / mouse of nu-3 in saline ( table 1 ) . 
 mice were fasted 24  h before given the test materials and were allowed to get food and water adlibitum after intragastric administration . 
 animals were observed for their death and subjected to a gross necropsy immediately after they died until day 8 , after which the survivor were euthanized and subjected to a gross necropsy and histopathology observation for toxicity . 
 livers were removed and fixed by 4% neutral formalin at room temperature for 48  h. the serial tissue sections at 5-m - thick were obtained after embedded in paraffin . each slide was stained with hematoxylin and eosin ( h&e ) then examined under light microscopy ( olympus cx31 ) . throughout the study , the clinical symptoms , neurological behavior and body weight were recorded daily . 
 three mice of control , male and female group were sacrificed and their lymphocyte suspensions were prepared from the spleen on 24  h after being intragastrically administered with a single dose of nu-3 at 100  mg / kg / mouse . 
 single - lymphocyte suspensions were incubated in triplicates in 96-well plates at 2    10  cells / well , in rpmi-1640 plus 5% of fetal calf serum ( fcs ) at 37c in a 5% co2 incubator and stimulated for 48  h with 2  g / ml precoated anti - cd3 and 1  g / ml anti - cd28 ( positive control ) , 2  g / ml of bsa ( irrelevant antigen ) , or no antigen ( negative control ) . 
 t - cell proliferation was evaluated by cell titer 96 aqueous nonradioactive cell proliferation assay was performed according to the manufacturer 's instruction ( promega , usa ) . 
 the mixture of mts / pms ( 20  l each well ) was added to each well to develop the color . 
 after 4  h of incubation , the od values of plates were read at 490  nm by a plate reader ( magellan , tecan austria gmbh ) . 
 data were expressed as stimulation index ( si ) , calculated as the mean reading of triplicate wells of antigen stimulation , and divided by the mean reading of triplicate wells of negative control . 
 there were ten rats in the treatment group ( 5 males ; 5 females ) in which rats were treated with 50  l of 100  mg / ml nu-3 in saline . 
 fur was clipped from dorsal area of the trunk 24  h prior to the test and was reclipped as necessary to allow observation and dosing . 
 the test materials were applied on the shaved area and kept in contact with the help of nonirritating styptic plaster and porous gauze bandage . to ensure that local application of nu-3 remained in the dorsum of animals , the measure of fastening multiply was taken . 
 briefly , a band - aid was put on the liniment area , and then covered a pad of medical gauze , followed by wrapping up with gauze bandage . 
 rats were treated with the test materials for 6  h per day . at the end of 6 hours 
 , any residual material was gently removed from the treatment site using cotton bud soaked in distilled water . 
 cage side observation was made daily , which included evaluation of the effect on skin , fur , eyes , and respiratory and neural behavior . by the 29th day half of the rats 
 the remaining animals were observed for further 14 days , and then they were euthanized , subjected to a gross necropsy and organ weights recorded on day 43 . during the study , body weight , 
 ten rats were used in the test . on the day prior to dosing , an area on the dorsal surface of the skin was clipped free of hair . on the day of dosing , 
 then 10  mg / ml nu-3 in saline was applied to the shaved area of five rats and the skin was covered with nonirritating styptic plaster and porous gauze bandage . 
 after 6  h of exposure period , the coverings were removed and the test area was rinsed with distilled water . 
 the rats were examined for the presence of erythema and oedema according to a skin irritation scoring standard at the intervals of 1 , 24 , 48 , and 72  h . rat eye irritation test was used to evaluate the degree to the mucous irritation of nu-3 . 
 six rats were used for this test and each animal served as its own control . 
 0.03  ml nu-3 of 1  mg / ml concentration with saline was dripped to the left eyes of the rats , and 0.03  ml saline was dripped to the right eyes of the rats as control . 
 all the measures were taken to ensure that the test materials are dripped into the conjunctival sac of the rats . 
 the rats were examined for the presence of changes in eyes according to the eye irritation scoring standard at grading intervals of 1 , 4 , 24 , 48 , 72 and 96  h. then sum of scores calculated was classified according to the eye irritation scoring standard . 
 the purpose of this study was to assess the ability of nu-3 to induce mutations at the hgprt locus in cultured mammalian cells . 
 cultures were purged of preexisting mutants by growth for 2 days in dmem / f-12 medium supplemented with 10% fbs , 5    10  m thymidine , 1    10  m hypoxanthine , and 3.2    10  m aminopterin . 
 the test was performed according to the procedure of o'neill and hsie   and o'neill et al . 
 the cells which were purged of preexisting mutants were treated for 4  h with the test and control materials and then allowed an expression time of 79 days ; the cells were then replated . 
 after the period of expression of the mutant phenotype , mutant colonies were selected in the following manner . 
 each culture flask was trypsinized and the cells were seeded in new flasks as follows : ( a ) 3 flasks each with 200 cells and without the purine analogue 6-thioguanine ; ( b ) 3 flasks each with 2    10 cells and with 6-thioguanine ( 10  g / ml ) . 
 after 8 days , selection was determined by the formation of colonies resistant to the purine analogue . 
 next , the colonies were fixed with methanol for 15  min and stained with giemsa ( sigma ) for 30  min . 
 nu-3 was evaluated in the presence and absence of a metabolic activation system derived from rat liver ( s9 ) . 
 dimethylbenzanthracene was used in the positive control for the activated assay and ethyl methanesulfonate was used in the positive control for the nonactivated assay . 
 the nu-3 concentrations for the assay ranged from 500 to 2000  g / ml . the colony counts obtained were used to calculate : ( a ) cloning efficiency ( ce ) in absolute values ( number of colonies formed divided by the number of cells seeded ) ; ( b ) the number of mutant colonies observed in each treatment ; ( c ) the absolute ce observed after selection ; ( d ) the mutation frequency ( mf ) ( number of mutant colonies divided by the number of clonable cells which was equal to the number of cells seeded  the absolute ce after selection ) . 
 nu-3 was evaluated for its ability to induce micronuclei in the bone marrow of balb / c mice according to hayashi et al . . 
 cyclophosphamide ( pc ) was used as the positive control , and saline was the negative control . 
 groups of five male and five female balb / c mice were dosed with nu-3 at 250 , 500 , and 1000  mg / kg on 2 consecutive days via intragastric administration . 
 all the mice were euthanized 6  h after the last dosing , and the bone marrow was taken to make smear . 
 bone marrow cells from animals were analyzed for the number of polychromatic erythrocytes ( pces ) that contained at least one micronucleus . 
 a minimum of 2000 pces was analyzed for the negative control , the positive control and for mice treated with the nu-3 . 
 the pce fraction was determined by counting a minimum of 200 erythrocytes ( pces plus normochromatic erythrocytes [ nces ] ) . 
 data were expressed as means    sd and subjected to one - way anova with factors of treatment , genotype or wild type . 
 mice were intragastrically administered with a single dose of nu-3 at 2500 ( group 1 ) , 1988 ( group 2 ) , 1580 ( group 3 ) , 1256 ( group 4 ) , and 1000 ( group 5 )  mg / kg / mouse ( table 1 ) . 
 following the single dose , five male and four female mice in group 1 , four female in group 2 died in 24 hours . 
 one female in group 2 and one female in group 4 died on day 1 . from day 2 to day 8 none of the mice in all the groups died . according to the mortality of each group , the minimum lethal dose ( mld ) was calculated to be 1256  mg / kg . clinical observations of the dying mice attributed to the administration of nu-3 were lethargy , tachypnea , and tremor and disheveled clothing hair . 
 there were no treatment - related effects on mouse behavior in the cage and body weight for males or females ( data not shown ) . in the early dead mice , 
 some pathological changes were found , including livers turning white and brittle with some yellowish brown nidi , the change of the spleen surface into uneven with some hemorrhagic spots , and kidneys showing some gray - white focus on surfaces . 
 it was also observed that there were some damages and hemorrhage in gastric walls and intestinal tracts of mice which died in 5 hours after being administered . 
 there was no obvious pathological change at gross necropsy and histopathological changes in liver for scheduled euthanasia mice in the study ( figure 2 ) . to examine 
 if the administration of nu-3 could affect on immune system , the spleen cells were used to test t - cell proliferation . as shown in figure 3 , 
 the treatment with nu-3 had no impact on proliferation of spleen t - cells stimulated with either anti - cd28 ( positive control ) or bsa ( irrelevant antigen ) compared with the cells from the nontreated mice . 
 rats were applied with 50  l of 100  mg / ml nu-3 ( total dose of 250  mg / kg / day ) for 28 days . 
 there were no evident toxic symptoms in both treated and control rats during observation time . 
 control and test rats showed a similar pattern of weight growth , food and water uptake ( figure 4 ) . 
 although there seemed to be some lagging in water uptake in treated group compared to control ( figure 4(b ) ) , the body weight of test group seemed to increase faster ( figure 4(a ) ) . 
 there were no treatment - related changes on food uptake in treated rats compared to the controls ( figure 4(c ) ) . during the observation time after administrating nu-3 on the back of the body for 28 days , there were no significant differences between the treated and control rats in the body weight gain although the treated rats took less water and food compared to the controls . 
 no obvious pathological changes were found in all organs by gross appearance . moreover , there was no significant difference ( p  >  .05 ) in the organ weight between the test groups and the control group ( table 2 ) . 
 the results of histopathological analysis of necropsy samples on liver , kidney , spleen and skin of the body back where nu-3 was applied showed no significant pathological changes and toxic effects except that there was a slight increase in skin labrocytes of the treated rats in comparison with the controls ' . 
 hematology and selected serum chemistry analyses also showed no significant differences ( p  >  .05 ) between control and treated groups ( table 3 ) . 
 after applied with nu-3 on the dorsal surface , the rats were examined for the presence of erythema and oedema on the test area according to a skin irritation scoring standard . 
 the results showed that the scores for erythema and oedema were 0 at 1 , 24 , 48 , and 72  h after administration , which was the same to the controls ' . 
 the eye irritation scores were recorded according to the eye irritation scoring standard   at 1 , 4 , 24 , 48 , 72 , and 96  h after administration , all of which were shown to be 0 . therefore , according to the skin and eye irritation scoring standard , all the rats did n't show any toxic symptom after being given nu-3 . 
 the treated skins and eyes were normal compared to the controls . the mutation frequency was assessed based on the number of mutants per 1    10 clonable cells ( table 4 ) . in the activated assay , 
 the mean mutation frequency was 3.3 for the saline negative control , 244 for the dimethylbenzanthracene positive control , 5.4 for the 500  g / ml concentration of nu-3 ; 4.5 for the 1000  g / ml concentration of nu-3 and 6.9 for the 2000  g / ml concentration of nu-3 . 
 in the nonactivated assay , the mean mutation frequency was 3.3 for the saline negative control ; 187 for the ethylmethanesulfonate positive control , 4.5 for the 500 g / ml concentration of nu-3 , 5.7 for the 1000  g / ml concentration of nu-3 and 8.3 for the 2000  g / ml concentration of nu-3 . 
 these data suggested that nu-3 was not mutagenic in the testing system both in the activated and nonactivated assays in the dose range from 01000  g / ml . 
 however , at a very high concentration ( 2000  g / ml ) there appeared to have an increase in mutation frequency , which suggested a weak positive response . 
 the percentage of pce and nce of the erythrocytic lines in the nu-3-treated groups were not significantly different from that in the control group . 
 there was a significant difference in the numbers of micronucleated pce between the positive control group and all nu-3 treated groups ( p  <  .01 ) and between the high dosing group and the negative control ( p  <  .03 ) . however , there was no significant difference between the two low - dosing groups and the negative control group ( p  >  .05 ) . 
 in all the test groups , the pce numbers were almost same between the males and females . 
 these results indicated that at low and medium dosages , nu-3 caused no evident cytotoxicity . at a very high dose ( 1000  mg / kg ) , 
 an increase in the pces with absolute values outside the normal control levels ( i.e. , 0.3%0.4% ) was observed , suggestive of a weak genotoxic potential for nu-3 . 
 antibiotic drug development has failed to keep pace with the numbers of emerging antibiotic resistant strains and variants . 
 consequently , the past decade has seen the emergence of the widely publicized health crisis where the means to combat drug - resistant , plague bacteria and viral pandemics are failing . 
 nu-3 is a novel small molecule and has been examined in several studies for its antibacterial and therapeutic action , showing that it was as effective as intravenously administered ciprofloxacin , a potent and broadspectrum fluoroquinolone . 
 , we reported that nu-3 is hypotoxical by intragastric administration . in the repeated dermal toxicity test 
 the irritation study on cutis and mucosa revealed that nu-3 did not irritate the skin tissue . 
 further studies demonstrated that nu-3 had no notable genetic toxicity both in vitro and in vivo . 
 taken together , our data suggested that nu-3 is a well tolerated and exhibited no toxicity when administrated via intragastric and topical routes . 
 chemically , nu-3 is a modified nucleotide , which could potentially cause genetic mutations in the target tissues through disrupting dna or rna replication / transcription . to examine 
 if this is the case for nu-3 , the golden standard assays in cells and animals were performed and found no meaningful mutational effect on the testing subjects . 
 it is unlikely that nu-3 could compete with dttp in the cellular environment to be incorporated into dna during replication . 
 second , although the antibacterial activities of nu-3 have been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo , its mechanism of action is still not clear . 
 one of the possible mechanisms for nu-3 action has recently been proposed , which was supported by the preliminary data showing that nu-3 caused significant changes of the membrane polarity . 
 lastly , the pharmacological data indicated that the bioavailability and pk profile of nu-3 were similar to those from other nucleoside drugs , which supports the notion of its hypotoxicity for pharmaceutical use ( unpublished data ) . 
 thus , we suggest that the lack of genotoxicity of nu-3 observed in this study may be due to its unique feature of the mechanisms of action .","ten rats treatment group males females rats treated l mg ml nu saline

 however , data on the toxicological profile of nu-3 are still lacking . in the present study , 
 the toxicity of nu-3 was evaluated by the following studies : acute oral toxicity , dermal and mucous membrane irritation , multiple - dose toxicity and genotoxicity in vivo and vitro . 
 the acute oral toxicity test in mice showed that nu-3 had an ld50 of 2001mg / kg body weight . 
 the irritation tests on rats revealed that nu-3 was not irritant , with an irritation scoring of 0 . 
 the multiple - dose toxicity study in rats showed that nu-3 did not cause significant changes in histology , selected serum chemistry , and hematological parameters compared to the controls . 
 rats administrated with multiple - doses of nu-3 showed no visible toxic symptoms . both in vitro and in vivo , nu-3 exhibited no notable genetic toxicity . 
 overall , the data suggest that nu-3 is hypotoxic or nontoxic antimicrobial compound that warrants being further developed for treating pseudomonas aeruginosa infection ."
"diseases that affect the buccal cavity are considered a serious public health problem . among the more prevalent 
 periodontal diseases and dental caries are usually caused by the presence of biofilm as a result of ineffective mechanical oral hygiene practices . 
 for this reason , chemical agents are important to reduce gingivitis , periodontal disease , and dental caries.1 candida albicans has already been isolated from the dental biofilm , caries , and the periodontal pockets , which together with streptococcus mutans has more severe consequences.2 there are also several clinical issues associated with c. albicans which represent serious problems for treatment and prophylaxis.3 therefore , the development of more effective therapies to treat these diseases is one of the major public dental health challenges . 
 chlorhexidine gluconate ( chx ) is an antiseptic agent widely used to inhibit the formation of gingivitis and periodontitis.4 this cationic biguanidine interacts with the bacterial anionic surface and alters the integrity of the bacterial cell membrane leading to cytoplasm precipitation.5 however , besides the usual stability problems , this drug presents frequent side effects including taste perception alteration and an increase in tooth discoloration.6,7 for these reasons , several cyclodextrin ( cd ) inclusion complexes have been developed to increase stability and improve antimicrobial activity.4,8 the synergic association of chx and nystatin ( nys ) is a good option for the simultaneous control of c. albicans and s. mutans . like chx , nys has an unpleasant flavor that leads to nausea during oral application , limiting its use and reducing patient compliance despite its undoubted effectiveness in the control of candidiasis and other buccal cavity disorders.9 the formulation of nanostructured nys and chx could overcome the low solubility and stability problems of these drugs , producing a controlled release system with new improved antimicrobial activity . 
 previous reports have shown that a nys and chx -cyclodextrin ( cd ) inclusion can improve stability and solubility.4,10 however , better results can be obtained using nanocarriers with sustained release properties , such as sodium montmorillonite ( mmtna ) , the main constituent of bentonite ( 60% ) . 
 this nanocarrier may present some synergistic effect due to the capability of these materials to adsorb and fix bacteria and fungi , immobilizing their toxins,11 and also presents parallel lamellae with internal anionic surfaces and interlamellar cations for equilibrium and charge stabilization . 
 therefore , inclusion processes can occur with several different cations or small molecules , leading to substance encapsulation in the interlamellar space , increasing system tortuosity and water uptake.12 the use of mmtna for acetate chlorhexidine inclusion has been previously reported,11 as has the use of cd for chx and nys encapsulation.4,10 however , the use of water - soluble methyl--cyclodextrin ( mcd ) and hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin ( hpcd ) for chx , and mmtna for both drugs , are other possibilities to be studied in order to obtain stable formulations with tolerable taste.13 although there are several techniques to obtain cd complexes , such as co - precipitation , paste complexation , extrusion , spray drying , and kneading,6,1315 considering these drugs , most of the authors show only the application of solution technique . taking into account the industrial applicability , it has become necessary to evaluate other options , as kneading , due the feasibility and low cost . 
 the aim of this study is the development of new nano - structured drug - delivery systems with industrial applicability containing classical drugs for control of buccal pathologies , nys and chx , in order to increase the drug stability and improve the taste and antimicrobial action . 
 prepared and tested were inclusion complexes of nys and chx with mmtna , and chx with cd and two derivatives , mcd and hpcd . 
 ethanol 95% ( merck , darmstadt , germany ) , mmtna ( acros chemical co , pittsburgh , pa ) , cd , mcd , and hpcd ( wacker gmbh , munich , germany ) , nys and chlorhexidine ( sigma , st louis , mo ) were pharmaceutical grade .

 physical mixtures were prepared by mixing together cd and freeze - dried chx in a mortar at the same molar ratios . using the kneading method , cd and chx 
 an ethanol : water ( 70:30 ; v / v ) solution was added , and the system mixed for 30 minutes to obtain a homogeneous paste . 
 the paste was dried under reduced pressure and the granulometry adjusted using a 40 mesh sieve . using the solution method , 
 the appropriate proportions of chx and cd were mixed in 20 ml of distilled water using a magnetic stirrer for 72 hours . 
 nys and chx : mmtna nanosystems were prepared with the solution method using different cation exchange capacity ( cec ) values : 100% , 80% , and 60% of the total mmtna . 
 the cec value considered was 100 meqv of cation to 100 g of mmtna.12 the inclusion reactions were performed in triplicate for different periods ( 1 , 18 , 24 , and 48 hours ) , stirring at room temperature . 
 the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 40 minutes , and the precipitates dried in a vacuum desiccator . 
 these nanosystems were characterized by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrpd ) , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) , and differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) . 
 xrpd patterns of nanosystems , physical mixtures , and pure substances were recorded with a rigaku miniflex diffractometer bd11197 ( rigaku , tokyo , japan ) using cuk radiation with a current of 30 ma , voltage of 40 kv , and a 2 angle between 2 and 20. ftir spectra were collected by an ir prestige-21 shimadzu a210045 ( shimadzu , kyoto , japan ) spectrometer using 2% kbr pellets and wavenumber between 4000 and 400 cm . 
 dsc analyses were carried out with dsc 882e mettler - toledo equipment ( mettler - toledo , greifensee , switzerland ) using hermetically sealed aluminum pans under a nitrogen flow of 28 mlmin and heating rate of 10c  min . 
 the s. mutans ( atcc25175 ) and c. albicans ( atcc36901 ) strains were grown at 37c for 24 hours in the presence of the two drugs being tested and the isolated carriers ( cd and mmtna ) , with simultaneous comparison with the chx and mmtna nanosystems and chx 0.12% solution formulations . 
 the inoculum containing 10 cells / ml was uniformly seeded on plates containing solid brain heart infusion broth . 
 after drying the surface , 10 l of each sample was placed on the culture medium surface and incubated for 24 and 48 hours at 37c . 
 the inhibition effect was verified by the presence of inhibition zones around the area on the plate where the solution was deposited and sized for analysis and comparison .

 these nanosystems were characterized by x - ray powder diffraction ( xrpd ) , fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) , and differential scanning calorimetry ( dsc ) . 
 xrpd patterns of nanosystems , physical mixtures , and pure substances were recorded with a rigaku miniflex diffractometer bd11197 ( rigaku , tokyo , japan ) using cuk radiation with a current of 30 ma , voltage of 40 kv , and a 2 angle between 2 and 20. ftir spectra were collected by an ir prestige-21 shimadzu a210045 ( shimadzu , kyoto , japan ) spectrometer using 2% kbr pellets and wavenumber between 4000 and 400 cm . 
 dsc analyses were carried out with dsc 882e mettler - toledo equipment ( mettler - toledo , greifensee , switzerland ) using hermetically sealed aluminum pans under a nitrogen flow of 28 mlmin and heating rate of 10c  min . 
 the s. mutans ( atcc25175 ) and c. albicans ( atcc36901 ) strains were grown at 37c for 24 hours in the presence of the two drugs being tested and the isolated carriers ( cd and mmtna ) , with simultaneous comparison with the chx and mmtna nanosystems and chx 0.12% solution formulations . 
 the inoculum containing 10 cells / ml was uniformly seeded on plates containing solid brain heart infusion broth . after drying the surface , 
 10 l of each sample was placed on the culture medium surface and incubated for 24 and 48 hours at 37c . 
 the inhibition effect was verified by the presence of inhibition zones around the area on the plate where the solution was deposited and sized for analysis and comparison . 
 mouthwash formulations were developed with chx ( 0.120% w / v ) or with cd inclusion complexes . 
 water - soluble mint essence ( 0.1% v / v ) , ethanol ( 0.050% v / v ) , polysorbate 20 ( 0.500% v / v ) , sorbitol ( 70% w / w aqueous solution , 15.0% v / v ) , menthol ( 0.010% w / v ) , and water ( 20% ) were mixed until complete dissolution , and the volume was adjusted to 100% with water . 
 the formulations were assayed by high efficiency liquid chromatography ( hplc ) as described below . 
 the hplc system used was a lc-10 a / vp shimadzu ( shimadzu , kyoto , japan ) with a chromatography c18 column ( 250 mm  4.6 mm , 5 m particle size ) , the mobile phase was methanol : water with triethylamine 0.4% ( 63:37 ; v / v ) with a 0.8 ml  min flow rate . 
 the analysis was performed at room temperature , with a 20 l injection volume and monitored at a wavelength of 240 nm . 
 the running time was established at 15 minutes.6,16 the stability tests were performed based on international conference on harmonization guidelines17 with chx alone and inclusion complex the chx:c , chx : mcd , and chx : hpcd . 
 all the inclusion complexes were at a molar ratio of 1:1 and obtained by kneading . 
 the formulations were conditioned in a nova tica ( so paulo , brazil ) climatic chamber set to a relative humidity of 45c  2c and 75%  5% . 
 the chx : hpcd inclusion complex preparation , formulation , and stability evaluation have not yet been described in the literature . 
 the chx assay was carried out according to the usp 34.6,16 one - way analysis of variance and wilcoxon matched pairs tests were used to analyze all data obtained in this study using statsoft statistica ( statsoft inc , tulsa , ok ) software . 
 one - way analysis of variance and wilcoxon matched pairs tests were used to analyze all data obtained in this study using statsoft statistica ( statsoft inc , tulsa , ok ) software . 
 xrpd patterns of lyophilized chx , cd , and chx:cd complex are presented in figure 1 . 
 as expected , lyophilized chx shows an amorphous pattern after water uptake , while cd shows a highly crystalline pattern . 
 the xrpd patterns of the inclusion complexes show greater amorphous characteristics than pure cd and physical mixtures . 
 this is evidence of inclusion , as this disorder phenomenon has already been described by corts and colleagues.18 these amorphous patterns are characterized by the disappearance and decrease of peak intensity  a decrease of 70%80% with the kneading method and 80%90% with the solution method . 
 these amorphous patterns were observed at molar ratios of 1:1 , 1:2 , and 1:3 . 
 the ftir spectra of the cd inclusion complex ( data not shown ) showed the characteristic peaks of chx at 17001500 cm , corresponding to aromatic ring c = c stretching which is different from the cd peaks . 
 the spectra of both the physical mixture and the complex illustrated the typical peaks of each material of which the inclusion complex is composed , with the presence of significant frequency shifts . 
 these results demonstrate the efficacy of the inclusion process with a chx presence.18 as observed for cd , mcd presents a crystalline pattern ( xrpd ) and inclusion is evidenced by sample amorphization . 
 the peak decrease was observed in samples prepared by both methods and at all molar ratios : 1:1 , 1:2 , and 1:3 . in this case 
 this lack of crystallinity indicates inclusion complex formation as shown by figueiras and colleagues.19 the characteristic peaks of both chx and mcd can be seen in the ftir spectra of the inclusion complexes with significant shifts , confirming the presence of chx in the inclusion processes . 
 the characteristic peaks of hpcd are at 2 angles of 11.4 and 19.3. a 60% peak reduction can be observed in the xrpd pattern of the complex produced by kneading at a 1:1 molar ratio . 
 the samples produced by the solution method did not show significant peak reduction , meaning that the method employed is determinative to this complex formation . 
 wang and colleagues observed the same characteristics producing trans - ferulic acid complexes.20 the characteristic peaks of both chx and hpcd were demonstrated by the ftir spectra of the inclusion complexes with significant shifts , confirming the effect of the presence of chx in the production processes . 
 thermal analysis , which is based on the comparison of the thermal behavior of single components , their physical mixture , and inclusion complexes , is the usual technique for qualitative investigation of cd inclusion complex formation . 
 21 dsc curves for the pure substances and inclusion compounds are shown in figure 2 . 
 the dsc curve of chx shows stability from 25c to 174c , after which , a sequence of thermal decomposition events were observed . 
 dsc curves of inclusion compounds show that the chx degradation peak temperature was higher for all inclusion complexes obtained with cd and its synthetic derivatives ( mcd and hpcd ) . 
 this evidences a new supramolecular compound formation characteristic of inclusion complexes with improved stability . the disappearance or flattening of the drug melting point peak 
 are considered conclusive evidence of inclusion compound formation.21 yallapu and colleagues have observed these same patterns for curcumin complexation , where the melting endothermic peak of the drug completely disappeared in the dsc curves.22 in all cd derivatives studied , the kneading method was chosen to prepare inclusion complexes of chx , cd , mcd , and hpcd at a 1:1 molar ratio , due its low cost and industrial applicability . 
 mmtna was used as a nanocarrier due to its sustained release properties and synergistic antimicrobial activity . 
 the nanosystems produced were characterized by xrpd , dsc , and ftir . a decrease in the 2 value observed in the xrpd analysis is an indicative factor of the inclusion process since a reduction in this angle 
 is associated with an increase in basal spacing , which is related to drug inclusion.23 the chlorhexidine nanosystem obtained showed a 2 value decrease , described in table 1 , when compared with pure mmtna , indicating the success of the inclusion process . 
 however , there is no significant difference between all the proposed conditions presented in table 1 ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 chx molecule rearrangement should also be considered since , like an alkyl ammonium chain , chx may have a particular conformation that expands basal spacing in low concentration between lamellae . 
 absorption of chx can occur when a high concentration is used for inclusion . in order to avoid this , 
 a 60% cec was used ( 24 hours ) . under these conditions , the inclusion complex presented an average lamellar spacing of 16.8  1.3  and an inclusion yield of 70.0%  0.02% . 
 these results corroborate those observed by meng and colleagues11 and yang and colleagues,24 who reported an interlamellar space increase from 15.1 to 19.4  and 14.5 to 16.6  , respectively , for chx acetate . 
 these authors have observed that the chx molecular volume is around 0.5 nm , slightly less than the 0.69 nm calculated by subtracting the mmtna monolayer size ( 0.96 nm ) from the basal spacing measurement ( 1.65 nm ) . 
 this larger molecular volume may be due to a different conformation assumed by chx in mmtna lamellae.11 dsc curves for the pure substances and nanosystems are shown in figure 3 . 
 nanosystem c3 shows an endothermic peak between 200c and 220c , which may indicate the release of chx from lamellar spacing 
 . this result may be evidence that substances intercalated between clay lamellae can be observed through the calorimetric patterns of nanosystems at different temperatures.24 ftir spectra of pure chx , mmtna , physical mixtures , and nanosystems present characteristic stretching bands due to water absorption at 3462 cm , 3400 cm , and 3420 cm . 
 the hydroxyl group from the al - oh bond presents a stretching band at around 3620 cm . 
 vibration bands of silicate between montmorillonite lamellae are shown at 1114 cm and 1047 cm for the si - oh bond.11,25 regarding the spectra of chx , this shows a shift of the stretching bands for the aromatic n - h and c - h bonds at 3396 cm and 3226 cm respectively . 
 it is important to note that the spectra of the physical mixture , which simulates c3 , showed differences when compared with the spectra of the inclusion process , indicating their contrasting profiles and confirming the inclusion process . 
 the nys : mmtna inclusion studies showed a 2 value decrease in relation to pure mmtna , which is evidence of nanosystem formation under all tested conditions ( table 2 ) . 
 however , the 24-hour inclusion period produced a larger basal spacing with all tested cec . 
 the nanosystem n3 ( 60% cec ) was chosen for characterization due to the higher basal spacing compared with 100% cec and the economic aspect . 
 this nanosystem presented an average lamellae spacing of 16.63  0.33  ( figure 4 ) and an indirect inclusion yield of 54%  0.01% . 
 xrpd profiles for the pure substances and nanosystem n3 at different cec values are shown in figure 4 . 
 this result is evidence of inclusion complex formation in the clay lamellae . the calorimetric pattern of nys derivatives are shown in figure 5 . 
 the characteristic thermal event related to nys , its melting point , occurs between 160c and 180c , but this is not registered on the dsc curve of the nys : mmtna 60% cec 
 this pattern is similar to the pure mmtna with an endothermic peak at 100c due to water loss . 
 the absence of nys endothermic melting point is evidence of inclusion , since the presence of the drug in the nanosystem was confirmed by ftir analysis ( data not shown ) . 
 the inhibition halo technique has the greatest applicability in the evaluation of antimicrobial activity of biologically active montmorillonite 
 chlorhexidine nanocomposite.24,26 therefore , the inhibition halo technique was used to evaluate and compare the activity of the nanosystems and pure drugs and the possible synergy of the drugs with clays and cd . 
 these nanosystems were prepared by kneading , using chx and cds at a 1:1 molar ratio . 
 the inhibition halo diameters observed for c. albicans and s. mutans are shown in table 3 . 
 all samples showed very similar activity and were quite similar to the chx aqueous solution against gram - positive bacteria and fungi . 
 however , corts and colleagues18 have shown that a chx:cd inclusion complex demonstrated modified antimicrobial activity when its minimum inhibitory concentration was measured , increasing its efficacy against pathogenic bacteria . 
 herein , contrary results were obtained with no statistical difference in the samples tested ( p = 0.07653 ) . 
 the halo diameters of the mmtna nanosystems are represented in table 4 and figure 6 . 
 the mmtna suspension did show any inhibition activity , which corroborates results shown by other authors.11,24,26,27 these authors not only tested sodium but also calcium montmorillonite . 
 chx aqueous solution 0.12% and the c3 derivative showed a large growth inhibition zone for both microorganisms . 
 halos for the chx solution against s. mutans were between 26 and 27 mm , while the c3 derivative presented halos of around 2122 mm . 
 furthermore , halos against c. albicans of 18 , 19 , and 26 mm were observed using the chx solution , and 11 , 12 , and 20 mm with the c3 derivative . 
 the smaller halo diameters presented by the c3 derivative were expected since it is an inclusion product with known prolonged release characteristics.24,27 yang and colleagues24 studied the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine acetate : mmtna nanosystems and found that chx was released slowly and the inhibition halo could be seen after 1 year . 
 however , the results of this present study show that the chx c3 derivative presented acceptable immediate release properties without total drug release , which is ideal for the treatment of oral diseases . 
 pure nys , an antifungal agent , did not show any inhibition activity against s. mutans , as expected , but presented halos ranging from 16 , 19 , and 27 mm against c. albicans strains ( table 4 , figure 6 ) . 
 these results are similar to those found by carrillo - muoz and colleagues of 20 mm.28 the nys nanosystem was expected to show the same prolonged release profile as c3 , but did not present any initial inhibition , indicating that the release is possibly slower than chlorhexidine due to lower nys solubility in water and saliva . 
 however , the large fluid volume in vivo could lead to a more effective release , justifying the use of this nanosystem in prolonged release tablets , which could be a therapeutic alternative to more complex pharmaceutical forms . 
 initially , the chx stability in a mouthwash formulation was investigated because chx has several incompatibilities with common excipients , such as some ions and organic compounds . 
 these incompatibility reactions lead to the formation of the degradation product p - chloroaniline and its subsequent precipitation.29,30 no precipitation or incompatibility was observed between chx and formulation excipients 48 hours after formulation preparation with pure chx . 
 mouthwash formulations were produced with pure chx and the inclusion complexes using 0.12% w / v chx content . 
 these samples were stored in a climatic chamber at 45c  2c and 75%  5% relative humidity ( rh ) in order to evaluate the thermal stability . 
 the results of the stability study are presented in figure 7 , and a great increase in the stability of all nanosystems studied can be seen , indicating the potential for the commercial application of these new cd derivatives . 
 xrpd patterns of lyophilized chx , cd , and chx:cd complex are presented in figure 1 . 
 as expected , lyophilized chx shows an amorphous pattern after water uptake , while cd shows a highly crystalline pattern . 
 the xrpd patterns of the inclusion complexes show greater amorphous characteristics than pure cd and physical mixtures .

"infarct of the anterior spinal artery is the most common subtype of spinal cord infarct , and is characterized by bilateral motor deficits with spinothalamic sensory deficits . 
 we experienced a case with atypical anterior - spinal - artery infarct that presented with bilateral hand weakness but without sensory deficits . 
 a 29-year - old man presented with sudden neck pain and bilateral weakness of the hands . magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the brain did not reveal any lesion . 
 his motor symptoms improved rapidly except for mild weakness in his left wrist and fingers . 
 magnetic resonance angiography showed proximal occlusion of the left vertebral artery ; a spine mri revealed left cervical cord infarction . 
 bilateral or unilateral hand weakness can be the sole symptom of a cervical cord infarct . 
 spinal cord infarction is much less frequent than cerebral infarction , accounting for only 1% of all strokes.1 the anterior spinal artery supplies the anterior two - thirds of the spinal cord via the sulcal ( central ) artery . 
 this usually results in anterior spinal artery infarcts presenting with profound bilateral motor deficits , sensory disturbances , and spinothalamic sensory deficits.2,3 although the mechanisms are not completely understood , there are some case reports of restrictive clinical syndromes , such as the ' man - in - the - barrel syndrome ' and the sulcal artery syndrome.4,5 here we describe a patient who presented with bilateral hand weakness but without sensory deficits due to left vertebral artery occlusion . 
 a healthy 29-year - old man without any vascular risk factors presented with sudden neck pain and bilateral hand weakness . after flexing his neck while tying his shoelaces 
 , the patient experienced a sudden , severe pain ( with a maximum score on a visual analog scale ) that started in the posterior neck and spread rapidly across the entire head . 
 bilateral hand weakness that followed the pain onset prevented the patient from tying his shoelaces . 
 the patient 's vital signs were stable upon hospital admission , except for markedly elevated blood pressure ( 202/108 mm hg ) . 
 the initial neurological examination revealed weakness in both flexion and extension of the wrists and fingers bilaterally , and during left leg extension [ medical research council ( mrc ) grade 4 ] . 
 however , the deep tendon reflexes were normal and the patient denied hypoesthesia in any sensory modality including pain , temperature , proprioception , and vibration . 
 laboratory findings were normal , and chest radiography did not reveal any pathology ; an electrocardiogram also produced no evidence of ischemia or arrhythmia . 
 his motor symptoms improved rapidly within 1 day except for mild weakness of his left wrist ( mrc grade of flexion / extension iv / iv ) and fingers ( mrc grade of flexion / extension iv / iv ; slightly more severe in the 5th finger ) . 
 brain computed tomography ( ct ) and brain magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) did not reveal any signal abnormalities or mass lesions . 
 however , ct aortography identified severe stenosis and occlusion of the left vertebral artery , and a pseudo lumen with mural thrombi was suspected on cervical mri ( fig . 
 mri of the cervical segment produced high signal intensities in the left gray matter of spinal cord at the c3 , c4 , and c6 levels on diffusion - weighted images ( fig . 
 magnetic resonance angiography performed 3 months after symptom onset showed persistent occlusion of the left vertebral artery . 
 unique features of this spinal - cord - infarct patient were bilateral hand weakness , absence of sensory deficits , and rapid improvement of motor symptoms in the right hand and left leg . 
 weakness of both arms has been reported previously in association with cervical cord infarcts , typically also with spinothalamic sensory deficit and vertebral artery occlusion.4,5,6,7 the mechanism that preserves leg strength in these cases is most likely collateral flow from the surrounding pial plexus.4 nevertheless , weakness of both hands without sensory deficits is rare in infarcts of the cervical spinal cord , and its mechanism remains to be determined.7,8 the anterior spinal artery forms at the level of the foramen magnum from the branches of the vertebral artery , and gives rise to the sulcal ( central ) arteries that penetrate the right and left sides of the spinal cord.3 unlike circumferential areas of the spinal cord , its interior has no anastomosis and the sulcal arteries are essentially end arteries . 
 therefore , the weakness of both hands in the present patient suggests that the end - arteries zone or the zone bordering the sulcal artery and circumferential artery corresponds to a region where hand motor neurons are located bilaterally.8 this would include the ventrolateral to lateral regions within the gray matter of the lower cervical spinal cord ( fig . 
 3).9,10 alternatively , the hand motor areas may be more vulnerable than the more proximal arm motor areas . 
 the hand motor area occupies a relatively large proportion of the cortical homunculus , so the hand motor area may occupy a larger area in the spinal gray matter , or require a larger blood supply.11,12 finally , the isolated unilateral hand weakness of this patient may be related to variation in the branches of the sulcal artery . 
 successive sulcal arteries generally alternate in their distribution to the left or right side of the spinal cord , but not both ; this would make unilateral involvement or improvement possible.5 sensory deficit was absent in the present case . 
 all subtypes of spinal cord infarcts are presumed to have sensory deficits , and therefore a pure motor presentation can result in misdiagnosis.2,3 anterolateral involvement could explain the present atypical presentation , and bilateral presentation without facial weakness may indicate a spinal cord infarct.5 transient ischemic attacks in the spinal cord reported occur primarily in the cervical cord , and recovery depends on the severity of the initial involvement and its collateral flow.1,2,6 cervical lesions are generally less vulnerable to ischemic insults than are thoracic or lumbar lesions due to the intensive vascularization from the vertebral and radicular arteries.3,6,13 the rapid improvement in the present case might therefore have resulted from initial distal involvement and collateral flow from the intact right vertebral artery . in conclusion , transient bilateral hand weakness can be the initial symptom of a spinal cord infarct , and unilateral hand weakness can be the sole symptom of a cervical cord infarct .","experienced case atypical anterior spinal artery infarct presented bilateral hand weakness without sensory deficits

"the superior semicircular canal dehiscence ( sscd ) syndrome was described by lloyd b. minor et al1 in 1998 . 
 third opening  or  third window  between the superior semicircular canal and the middle cranial fossa , secondary to a bony defect in the canal . 
 this abnormal communication can result in vertigo and oscillopsia induced by loud sounds ( tullio 's phenomenon ) , by valsalva maneuvers , or by changes in pressure in the external auditory canal ( hennebert 's sign ) . 
 the patients may also present autophony , hyperacusis , pulsatile tinnitus and hearing loss . in patients with debilitating symptoms and low health utility scores , 
 a surgical management may be offered , since the manifestations of the disease and the utility score may improve with surgery . 
 the different surgical techniques used to approach and repair the sscd include the middle cranial fossa approach , the transmastoid approach , the endoscopic - assisted middle cranial fossa approach , and the round window tissue reinforcement . in this review of the literature 
 we analyze this clinical syndrome and its diagnosis , as well as the aforementioned surgical approaches and techniques performed to repair the dehiscence . 
 there are two functional windows in the cochleovestibular system , the oval window , which allows the passage of soundwaves into the inner ear 's scala vestibuli through the stapes footplate , and the round window , involved in the release of sound and mechanical energy from de scala tympani out of the inner ear . 
 when a dehiscence in the superior semicircular canal is created , the hydro - acoustic waves flowing through the cochlea are inadvertently transmitted throughout the labyrinthine system . 
 in addition , the intracranial pressure may be transmitted through the dehiscent superior canal , also causing the stimulation of vestibular end organs until the round window releases this pressure.2 in a more detailed manner , a sscd alters the hydrodynamic stability of this system , enabling an exaggerated movement of the endolymph . since 
 a third window is present , the transmission of pressure through the inner ear may result in an outward bulging of the membranous canal at the bony defect to the side of the middle cranial fossa . 
 hydraulically speaking , it would serve as a pressure release valve and , therefore , less pressure would be distributed in the inner ear , as it would in a closed hydraulic system.3 when this outward bulging of the membranous labyrinth is produced , the disturbed endolymph fluid motion causes the ampullofugal deflection of the cupula of the superior semicircular canal , which the brain perceives as body movement , thus resulting in vestibular symptoms.4 intracranial pressure fluctuations or negative pressure in the external or middle ear may lead to the contrary , an abnormal reversal of energy through the dehiscence into the labyrinth , resulting in an inward bulging of the membranous canal with a consequent ampullopetal deflection of the cupula.3 
 4 these theories support the noise or pressure - induced vertigo observed in the sscd syndrome . 
 the increased compliance of the inner ear explained earlier also contributes to the conductive hearing loss and the perception of the pulsatile tinnitus observed in these patients.2 the pathologic opening from the sscd may weaken the energy transmission produced by the movement of the stapes footplate , resulting in the reduction of sound transmission to the cochlea and hearing loss . on the other hand , the normal impedance inequality of the oval and round windows may be altered by the third window , which results in bone hyperconduction that the patient perceives as autophony or hyperacusis.5 
  the diagnosis is suspected by the clinical manifestations mentioned earlier . 
 nystagmus evoked by sound or pressure , with eye movements oriented in the same plane as the dehiscent semicircular canal , is a classic feature . 
 audiometric findings typically include supernormal bone thresholds and a low - frequency conductive hearing loss . the tympanometric examination and acoustic reflexes are normal.6 cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potential ( cvemp ) testing in patients with sscd syndrome will often have responses with lower thresholds ( less than 70 decibels [ db ] to tone burst testing ) than in people without the syndrome.7 in 2012 , zuniga et al8 showed that cvemp threshold results showed a sensitivity and a specificity ranging from 80% to 100% for the diagnosis of sscd syndrome . 
 in contrast , the ocular cvemp amplitudes demonstrated a sensitivity and a specificity greater than 90% . 
 finally , when a sscd syndrome is suspected , a temporal bone computed tomography ( ct ) scan confirms the diagnosis . 
 the best images are seen in a high resolution 0.5  mm collimation , and projections in the plane of the superior canal ( pschl views ) and in a perpendicular plane to this same canal ( stenvers views).9 two types of sscd have been described after a ct examination : dehiscence of the arcuate eminence or dehiscence in the region of the superior petrosal sinus . 
 studies have found that magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is also very useful for diagnosing sscd syndrome . in 2013 , browaeys et al10 described that when diagnosing sscd syndrome , the mri had a sensitivity of 100% , a specificity of 96.5% , a positive predictive value of 61.1% , and a negative predictive value of 100% in comparison with the ct . 
 the first manifestations of the syndrome usually occur during adulthood ; nevertheless , a congenital anomaly is suspected , since thinning of the bone overlying the superior semicircular canal occurs bilaterally in almost one - third of the patients , and there are some cases that began having symptoms during childhood.11 
 12 in contrast to adults , children with sscd syndrome usually present with auditory symptoms first , and conservative management should be carried out as often as possible.12 
  another possibility for the pathophysiology of this disease is that it may be an acquired condition . 
 repeated , low intensity cranial trauma from combat sports or diving , for instance , has been related to this disease . 
 a defect in the floor of the middle cranial fossa , at the level of the canal , may also occur secondary to increments in the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid.11 
  patients with mild symptoms should be treated with conservatively . for patients with debilitating symptoms and lower health utility scores , 
 both the clinical manifestations of the disease and the so - called health utility scores improve after surgery.13 when surgery is necessary , the bony dehiscence can be resurfaced , plugged or capped by different surgical approaches.14

  this approach to treat sscd syndrome was first described by minor et al.14 a 4    4 cm craniotomy is drilled 
 . the temporal lobe is retracted , and the arcuate eminence is identified . at this point 
 the canal may also be capped or resurfaced with bone pate , bone wax , hydroxyapatite cement or soft tissue . 
 the advantages of the middle fossa craniotomy include the direct access to the arcuate eminence defect without the need for labyrinthine bone removal and the exposure of the surrounding cranial base if the repair is needed for other associated tegmen defects . 
 concomitant resurfacing of the tegmen mastoideum and tympani is performed , since the floor of the middle cranial fossa is usually thin . 
 the surgical technique begins with a post auricular incision , as it usually performed for a mastoidectomy . 
 supra and subperiosteal flaps are made , and then a mastoidectomy is performed using a cutting burr with suction irrigation . 
 the sigmoid sinus , the posterior and middle fossa dura , and the pre - sigmoid area are all skeletonized . 
 the horizontal , posterior and superior semicircular canals are identified and skeletonized with a diamond burr . 
 the area of dehiscence is identified , and the middle fossa dura is carefully elevated from de dehiscent superior semicircular canal . in patients with dehiscence at the superior petrosal sinus , 
 the sinus was exposed at the sinodural angle , posterior to the solid angle , and followed to the superior canal.16 two points of the bony labyrinth are fenestrated with a 1  mm diamond burr , and the endosteum is opened just inferior to the fenestrated apex of the superior canal , on the ampullated and non - ampullated portions of the canal.19 care is taken to avoid suction or manipulation of the membranous labyrinth to prevent hearing loss or chronic disequilibrium after surgery.20 bone dust , bone wax , bone pate , fascia and even bone chips may be used to fill the lumen of the superior canal at the points of fenestration ( plugging the canal ) . if bone wax is used , cheng et al21 recommend that the applications of two wax spheres , 2  mm in size , is sufficient to occlude the canal without risk of damaging the neuroepithelium , which prevents vestibular hypofunction and hearing loss after the repair . 
 conchal cartilage is harvested and placed in an intracranial extradural position , repairing the middle cranial fossa floor defect , and finally the wound is closed in a regular fashion.19 
  when the transmastoid middle fossa resurfacing is selected , after dissecting the middle cranial fossa dura from the dehiscent canal , tragal perichondrium is placed in the space between the dura and the dehiscence by folding it over the top of an annulus elevator and inserting it over the superior canal . the dura and overlying temporal lobe or superior petrosal sinus will stabilize the position of the graft , with no tendency to extrude.16 
  it 
 is well known that the transmastoid approach avoids the risks of performing a craniotomy in the middle fossa , resulting in lower morbidity and a shorter hospital stay . 
 the disadvantage of transmastoid procedures is that the dehiscence is visualized with more difficulty compared to the middle fossa approach.22 another limitation is when the tegmen hangs too low , precluding the safe exposure and manipulation of the dura just lateral to the superior semicircular canal . 
 a preoperative ct scan is very important in order to anticipate this difficulty , and it could precisely identify the size , extension and location of the dehiscence . 
 the endoscopic - assisted middle fossa procedure appears to be advantageous when compared with binocular microscopy , since it provides a high definition view of the middle cranial fossa . in this surgical technique , following the incision , a temporalis fascia graft is harvested . 
 a periosteal flap is made , and a minicraniotomy ( 3    2 cm ) is performed . under microscopy , the dura is gently elevated off the tegmen mastoideum and tegmen tympani until the arcuate eminence is visualized . 
 then , a 3  mm wide , 14 cm long , 30 rigid endoscope is introduced in order to visualize the defect . 
 the house - urban middle fossa retractor is used to maintain the retraction of the temporal lobe while working with the endoscope . 
 the dura is dissected from the medial aspect of the defect under endoscopic view . at this point 
 , a gentle occlusion of the ampullated and non - ampullated limbs of the defect is performed using bone wax.15 peng et al23 reported 10 cases managed with the endoscopic - assisted middle fossa technique in which they used hydroxyapatite bone cement to resurface the superior canal with good results . in 2014 , carter et al18 reported their experience with 5 patients managed endoscopically . 
 they mentioned that endoscopy enhances the visualization of the superior canal defect , allows for transillumination , and reduces temporal lobe retraction , making it a useful adjunct in craniotomies used to repair sscd defects . 
 this surgical technique is performed using a traditional tympanomeatal flap approach under general or local anesthesia . 
 if necessary , a drill or curettage is used to enlarge the posterior auditory canal wall in order to gain adequate exposure of the round window niche . this niche and the promontory 
 are denuded of mucosa , and the round window is reinforced with temporalis fascia , tragal cartilage , perichondrium , fat or connective tissue.24 the tympanomeatal flap is repositioned and the external auditory canal is packed . 
 the round window reinforcement is a procedure with low risk compared to the middle fossa or transmastoid approaches , and it may be offered as a first procedure in patients with mild symptoms . 
 complete occlusion of the round window is another technique that has been used for sscd syndrome , but some authors suggest that it should not be recommended , since it has been noticed that symptoms may become worse in the late postoperative period.24 
  different studies have shown that the combination of plugging and resurfacing achieves better long - term control of the symptoms than resurfacing alone . 
 when only resurfacing is performed , a complete sealing of the defect is not guaranteed , and this area may remain sensitive to pressure changes.25 
 26 goddard and wilkinson,22 in 2014 , showed excellent hearing outcomes and a reduction of the preoperative symptoms in 24 ears in which the plugging technique was used . 
 a meta - analysis of 64 surgical procedures for sscd syndrome indicated that capping and plugging had a significantly higher success rate when compared to resurfacing.27

 even though the conservative management , which avoids the precipitating stimuli and vestibular rehabilitation , is most often indicated , patients with debilitating symptoms may be offered surgical repair of the sscd .

 endoscopic assistance may also improve the middle cranial fossa approach , giving it an advantage .

"many previous studies have revealed that parents , especially mothers , of children with developmental disabilities such as intellectual disabilities ( ids ) , developmental delay , and physical and sensory handicaps are more likely to show signs of psychological distress or depressive symptoms and to exhibit lower well - being than parents of typically developing children [ 15 ] . 
 it is generally accepted that caring for a child who has a developmental disability may involve significant and prolonged periods of time and energy . 
 since the majority of this increased daily care - giving burden for these children is carried by their parents , they are supposed to have an increased risk for high levels of stress , and thus some cases may be linked to depression [ 7 , 8 ] . 
 recently , the mental health needs of adults with i d have also been taken up for discussion . 
 studies have revealed that psychiatric disorders are more prevalent in people with i d compared within the general population . 
 specialist psychiatric services for people with i d are available in some countries such as the uk and the usa ; however , the provision of high - quality psychiatric services remains a major concern in many countries . 
 . evidently , the current psychiatric services in japan are not adequate to meet the complex mental health needs of people with i d appropriately , sensitively , and effectively . 
 failure to provide services that meet the needs of these individuals may lead to problems such as high - level caregiver stress and inappropriate therapy . 
 the paucity of trained psychiatrists and other allied professionals is a major barrier to the development of this subspecialty in many countries . in japan , 
 high - quality psychiatric services for the parents of children with i d are assumed to be not well established . 
 so far , the major portion of resources has been directed to the treatment of and services connected with the children , and not enough attention has been paid to the actual mental condition and needs of the parents . to our knowledge , there have been no reports on a nationwide scale on the mental health and distress of parents having children with developmental disabilities in japan . since the understanding of the parents ' 
 mental health may be essential for providing more appropriate support , we aimed to obtain a clear perspective on the situation facing the parents through this facility - based nationwide study . 
 the current survey included 1,102 institutions and consultation centers for children with developmental disabilities distributing in all prefectures in japan , which were listed in the national register of agencies , organizations , and institutions related to intellectual disabilities   and the directory of support centers for individuals with developmental disabilities . 
 in japan , these institutions and centers play a key role in social support networks . 
 professional workers in these facilities come into contact with children as their clients , and also with the children 's guardians , mainly with the mothers , on a daily basis . 
 the questionnaire was written in japanese and was divided into two sections with a total of 47 multiple choice questions . 
 the first section sought information about the characteristics of the facility , such as staff adequacy , the scale of the facility , the health promotion services provided , the ages of their clients , and the clients ' main disabilities , namely , i d , pervasive developmental disorder ( pdd ) , profound intellectual and multiple disabilities ( pimd ) , physical disabilities , and others . 
 the second section sought information about the clients ' parents , such as signs of mental health distress and their needs , from the professional caregivers ' point of view . 
 also measures taken by the professional caregivers when encountering distressed parents were asked in detail . 
 questionnaires were mailed in october 2008 , with an explanatory letter to the person in charge of each institution or consultation center . when agreement was met to participate in this study , one or more service providers in each facility completed the questionnaire based on all sources of information available . 
 the questionnaire was to be returned unsigned , using the stamped , self - addressed envelope enclosed . for ethical considerations , the information disclosed in the questionnaire was in a form which made it impossible to identify the facility and clients 
 this study was approved and carried out under the supervision of the japan league on developmental disabilities ( jidd ) . 
 the statistical analysis including the chi - squared test was performed with the aid of the statistical package for the social sciences 15.0 ( spss japan , inc . ) . 
 a two - sided p value of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant . answers to open - ended questions 
 a total of 460 out of 1,102 facilities replied within four weeks , the response rate being 41.7% . according to the clients ' main disabilities , 
 each facility was classified into the following categories : i d , pdd , pimd , physical disability group , and others ( table 1 ) . 
 the last group was small in number and diverse in character and also included responders who provided incomplete information ; thus , data from this group were omitted from analysis hereafter . 
 also in table 1 , the number of clients ( mean persons per facility ) as an index of facility scale , their mean age , and proportion of male gender are shown . 
 their average age ( sd ) was 44.7 ( 9.5 ) years old for the i d group , 53.0 ( 7.6 ) for the pdd group , 48.3 ( 8.4 ) for the pimd group , and 55.3 ( 4.9 ) for the physical disability group . 
 373 out of the 415 facilities ( about 90% ) experienced cases with difficulties when communicating with the clients ' parents . 
 the percentage was high regardless of the children 's disabilities , being concretely highest in the pdd group ( 96.9% ) and lowest in the physical disability group ( 86.7% ) . 
 the proportion of such parents , out of the total , was reported to be  almost none  ( 5% or less ) or  few  ( less than one fourth of the clients ) in most of the facilities ( table 2 ) . 
 it should be noted that in the i d and pdd groups , about 15% of the facilities responded that  about half  or more of the parents were difficult to communicate with . in all groups , 
 the characteristics of the i d and pdd groups were similar to each other , while the pimd and physical disability groups resembled each other . 
 in other words , in the i d and pdd groups , slightly more difficulties were experienced with the fathers compared to in the pimd and physical disability groups , where they experienced more difficulties with other family members such as the grandparents and siblings compared to the i d and pdd groups . 
 the primary reason for these difficulties was thought to be the parent 's personal condition , such as poor mental health ( table 2 ) . 
 this was especially true for the i d and pdd groups [ (df = 9 ) = 41.9 , p < 0.001 ] . in the pimd and physical disability groups , 
 the parent 's poor socio - economic status and heavy care - giving burden , reflecting the child 's level of disability , were considered to be major factors in approximately one - third of the cases . 
 signs of depression or a depressive state were the most common psychiatric disturbances seen in the parents . among the four groups , the pdd group most commonly experienced cases which showed signs of depression or a depressive state in parents . 
 the proportion of such parents was approximately 70% of the total [ (df = 12 ) = 65.1 , p < 0.001 ] . 
 well - treated cases were only 5% out of the total ; thus , most of these conditions were considered to be not medically well treated . 
 for further analysis , we selected 159 cases where symptoms of depression or a depressive state were reported in a descriptive manner . according to these reports , 
 we asked about the time of the onset , that is , whether it was prior to the birth of the child , when the parent first noticed the child 's disability , or after the child had been fully medically diagnosed . apart from the answer 
 unknown  which accounted for approximately half of the cases ,  prior to the birth of the child  was relatively common in the pdd group ( 22.1% ) , whereas 
 after the child had been fully medically diagnosed  was relatively common in the pimd ( 23.5% ) and physical disability groups ( 28.6% ) . 
 when a parent suffered from signs of psychiatric disturbances , more than half of the children experienced maltreatment . 
 physical neglect was most common in all groups , accounting for about 50% of the cases . in comparison with the other groups , in the pdd group , the child was likely to be emotionally disturbed and confined indoors ( 32.6% ) , in the pimd group , the child was mostly confined indoors ( 33.3% ) , and in the physical disability group , medical care neglect made the utilization of medical and welfare support impossible ( 50% ) [ (df = 12 ) = 27.6 , p = 0.006 ] . 
 the leading measures were gathering and disclosure of necessary information , discussion among service providers within the facility about ways to deal with the parent , protection of the child by providing a safe environment , making approaches to other family members for cooperation , intensive collaboration with other organizations such as institutions and consultation centers for better community support , and medical support for the parent provided by specialists such as physicians and psychologists . 
 many factors were reported to affect the mental health of parents . the presence or absence of support from other family members ( 
 i.e. , a spouse ) and the existence ( or not ) of a medical condition in the parent were major factors ( table 5 ) . 
 practical use ( or not ) of social support networks , whether the child 's level of disability was severe or not , and parent participation in face - to - face family support groups or not were also thought to be influential factors . in all groups , regardless of the child 's disability , more direct welfare support for the child was considered to be helpful and thus requested to be improved , in order to meet the mental health needs of the parent . besides this , in the physical disability group , family support groups , in the pimd group , support ( including financial support ) for other family members , and in the i d and pdd groups , support for other family members ( mainly siblings and the other parent ) and medical treatment of the parent 's psychiatric disturbance were also emphasized . to fulfill the demanded future role of their facility 
 , respondents expressed the importance of more collaboration with other institutions and consultation centers and the necessity for more special training courses targeting support professionals and recognized the urgent demand for more specialists especially psychologists who can support the mental health needs of both the children and their parents . 
 in the present study , we surveyed institutions and consultation centers for children with developmental disabilities in japan , which play a central role in the social support networks . 
 this facility - based nationwide survey revealed the situation facing the parents of children with i d and other developmental disabilities from the professional caregivers ' point of view . 
 almost all of the facilities experienced difficulties in keeping good relations with the clients ' parents , regardless of the children 's disabilities , and the majority of service providers noted that the proportion of such parents , out of the total , was roughly between 5 and 25% , and still increasing . 
 the primary reason for these difficulties was thought to be the parent 's condition , such as their mental health and background . 
 also , signs of depression or a depressive state were assumed to be the most common psychiatric disturbance seen . 
 these results suggested that thorough consideration of the parents ' mental health needs , especially prevention of depressive conditions and support for parents suffering from them , is urgent - demanded task for facilities . 
 i d , attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder ( ad / hd ) , and pdd are common developmental disorders , and the latter two are noted to have substantial genetic components . 
 it has been reported that a lifetime prevalence of major mood disorders is higher in parents of children with autism and that the onset for the majority was prior to the birth of their child with autism . 
 family history studies of autism consistently uncovered a large subgroup with a high incidence of major mood disorders among family members , suggesting the two entities are related clinically and genetically [ 19 , 20 ] . 
 the findings of the present survey must be interpreted allowing for the limitations of the use of unconfirmed data reported by professional caregivers ' who come into contact with children as their clients , and their parents on a day - to - day basis . evidently , the service providers ' perspective on parental mental health was consistent with previous reports from western countries on major mood disorders and pdd . 
 in other words , facilities where the clients were diagnosed as having pdd experienced significantly more cases of parents with signs of a depressive state compared to other facilities , and the onset of depression was considered to be prior to the birth of the child in many of the cases . although these professional caregivers were well trained and well experienced , only , one - third were physicians , nurses or psychologists . on account of the limitations of these data , 
 we emphasize confirming the diagnoses of psychiatric disturbances through direct contact with the parents by specialists such as psychiatrists is necessary in future studies , for accurate understanding of the overall problem . in japan 
 , there is no official system to check and document the parents ' condition including their mental health status . 
 parents are not accustomed to being asked about their own mental health , so there is a tendency to avoid discussion on matters concerning themselves . 
 this was the major reason why we asked the professional caregivers about the parents ' condition , not the parents directly , in this study . 
 but still we judged it to be worthwhile at this moment to summarize the professional caregivers ' impression on this issue , since the case in japan has never been described in detail despite of its importance . because the majority of burden for daily care of handicapped children is typically carried by mothers , particular concern is raised for their adaptation . in the past studies , the psychosocial outcomes in mothers 
 were said to be better predicted by psychosocial factors such as more active social life and family resources . 
 recent research focusing on parenting stress illustrated the value of the participation of fathers also . 
 greater marital quality predicted lower parenting stress for both mothers and fathers , while greater social support predicted increased parenting efficacy for fathers . 
 although the relationship between child characteristics and parental well - being has not reached an invariable agreement , the severity of a child 's disability , intellectual functioning , and so forth are generally considered to be risk factors . since the burden for daily care is mainly carried by the mother , similarly in japan , service providers tend to be in contact with the mother more frequently than other family members 
 . this may be partially the reason why service providers experienced difficulties in communicating with mostly the mothers in this study . 
 the presence of support from other family members , such as a spouse , is considered to be a major influential factor for the mental health of parents in japan also . 
 practical use of social support networks such as participation in face - to - face family support groups , more financial support for the household , more direct welfare support for the child , and medical treatment of the parent 's psychiatric disturbance were reported to be helpful and thus requested to be improved , in order to meet the mental health needs of the parent . 
 we would like to emphasize the fact that although the importance of medical treatment for the parents ' psychiatric disturbances was pointed out , it was also realized that these conditions were presently not being medically well treated . 
 this shows that current psychiatric services in japan are not adequate to meet the complex mental health needs of the parents appropriately . to resolve this challenging issue , 
 more intensive collaboration between other child - care facilities and organizations , aiming at the mental health needs of the parents , is demanded . 
 the paucity of trained psychiatrists and other allied professionals also needs to be addressed , and in order to fulfill this , sufficient discussion and research on the establishment of an effective training system for specialists is warranted . providing direct advice for the parents on the utilization of social support networks is a reliable measure that can be immediately taken . 
 training more professionals who can properly deal with the parents ' mental health needs is an urgent matter that must be tackled . 
 overall , the present study is the first nationwide survey that examined the professional caregivers ' perspective on the mental health of parents of children with developmental disabilities , and it underscores the importance of understanding and supporting the parents ' mental health needs , which leads to more appropriate support for children with developmental disabilities .","many previous studies revealed parents especially mothers children developmental disabilities intellectual disabilities ids developmental delay physical sensory handicaps likely show signs psychological distress depressive symptoms exhibit lower well parents typically developing children

overall present study first nationwide survey examined professional caregivers perspective mental health parents children developmental disabilities underscores importance understanding supporting parents mental health needs leads appropriate support children developmental disabilities","parents of children with intellectual disabilities and/or physical disabilities are supposed to have an increased risk for parenting stress and psychological distress . 
 we as professional caregivers sometimes experience difficulties in keeping good relations or communicating with the parents . 
 professional workers in 460 institutions and consultation centers throughout japan answered a questionnaire on their clinical experiences . about 90% of the facilities experienced  distressed parents ,  and the parents ' condition such as mental health seemed to influence this . 
 signs of a depressive state were the most common psychiatric disturbances detected , and it was notable in the pervasive developmental disorder group . more welfare support , presence of support groups , support from other family members , and medical treatment of the parents ' problems were considered to be helpful and thus requested to be improved .

"the prevention and treatment of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( ohss ) , an iatrogenic and potentially life - threatening disease process , which may occur in healthy young women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation ( coh ) for assisted reproduction has been the subject of maximum research and innovation since the inception of assisted reproductive technology ( art ) . as the exact etiopathogenesis of this syndrome is still elusive , the treatment is largely empirical and thus prevention forms the mainstay of management . 
 the preventive strategies aim , to target women at high risk of developing ohss and institution of various pharmacological and non - pharmacological interventions on them . 
 the pharmacological tools being used are : low - dose follicle stimulating hormone ( fsh ) or gonadotropin - releasing hormone antagonist protocol during stimulation , albumin infusion at the time of oocyte recovery , dopamine agonist cabergoline ( cb2 ) started from the day of ovulation trigger and institution of an insulin sensitizer like metformin , whereas the non - pharmacologic modalities incorporated are : coasting , cycle cancellation , cryopreservation of all embryos for future transfer or use of in vitro maturation . 
 although these preventive measures have not been able to completely eliminate this iatrogenic complication but have definitely brought about a reduction in the severity of ohss as , it is the , severe ohss , which is the cause of maximum concern . 
 severe forms of ohss may complicate 0.5 - 5% of in vitro - fertilization ( ivf ) cycles and can lead to severe morbidity and even mortality if not timely and appropriately intervened . 
 as the search for an ideal preventive therapy continued , a new and innovative therapy in the form of calcium gluconate infusion was introduced in the armamentarium of reproductive specialists to prevent this potentially dreadful complication , however , data and literature on its effectiveness is presently limited . in the present study , we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of intravenous ( iv ) calcium infusion in comparison to the dopamine agonist cb2 in preventing ohss in high risk patients undergoing assisted reproductive technique cycles . 
 a total of 202 patients at risk for developing ohss while undergoing ivf cycle at our center during the period of 01 january 2011 - 31 may 2012 were included in the study . 
 it was a comparative study wherein the 202 high risk patients after meeting the strict inclusion and the exclusion criteria , were randomly divided into two groups with 98 subjects in group i and 104 in group ii . 
 the women with even registration numbers were in group i and were administered iv calcium gluconate infusion while the remaining 104 who had odd registration numbers belonged to group ii and received the dopamine agonist cb2 . 
 evaluation of the subjects for the development of ohss was the primary outcome measure and requirement of hospitalization and abdominal paracentesis or pleural tap in the event of significant fluid collection because of severe ohss was the secondary outcome measure . 
 the inclusion criteria or patients who were at risk for ohss were : known case of polycystic ovarian disease as diagnosed by the rotterdam criteria ( 2004 ) , development of 18 or more follicles larger than 12 mm in diameter and history of ohss in the previous ivf cycle if any . 
 the patients were excluded from the study if they had other endocrinopathies in the form of diabetes mellitus , hyperprolactinemia or congenital adrenal hyperplasia . women with systemic diseases like bronchial asthma , hypertension or bleeding disorders were also excluded . if an antagonist cycle was instituted for coh the patients were not included in the study . 
 all 202 patients were administered oral contraceptive pills ( tablet loette ; pfizer ) from the 5 day of their menstrual cycle prior to their down regulation by the luteal long protocol . 
 leuprolide acetate ( lupride ; abbott cedex ) 1 mg subcutaneously was started from the 21 day of the cycle , i.e. , from the 17 day of oral contraceptive pill treatment . 
 this dose was reduced to 0.5 mg / day once down regulation was confirmed both sonologically and by serum estradiol levels ( < 50 pg / ml ) . 
 after the documentation of ovarian quiescence , recombinant fsh 150 iu / d ( gonal f ; merck serono ) was administered for next 4 days and doses adjusted thereafter as per the ovarian response as evident on the trans vaginal sonography . 
 human chorionic gonadotropin ( hcg ) 10,000 iu i m ( pregnyl ; organon ) was administered if greater than three follicles reached a mean diameter of 18 mm . 
 conventional ivf or intracytoplasmic sperm injection was performed on the retrieved oocytes depending on the couple 's history . 
 the embryos were graded on day 3 according to a 1 - 4 scoring system with 1 being the best , which was based on fragmentation , cell symmetry and blastomere number . 
 embryo transfer was not carried out in any of the high risk study group patients and all grade 1 and grade 2 embryos were cryopreserved for future transfer while grade 3 and grade 4 embryos were discarded after informing the patients . 
 the patients were informed about the status of their embryos and fertilization failure if any . 
 all the high risk subjects were managed on an out - patient basis with daily clinical and sonological monitoring and hospitalized only if they went into severe ohss or their clinical condition mandated close supervision . 
 a baseline hematological and biochemical profile on the day of pick up and daily thereafter was also carried out for the study group subjects as a part of monitoring for ohss . 
 the 104 patients belonging to group ii were started on tablet cb2 ( tab dostinex 0.5 mg ; pfizer ) 0.5 mg / day from the day of ovulation trigger and continued until the next 8 days . 
 the 98 high risk patients from group i were started on calcium gluconate injection after ovum pick up as per the protocol mentioned by yakovenko et al . 
 it was prepared by dissolving 10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate solution in 200 ml of physiologic saline and instituted over a period of 40 min . 
 this infusion was administered within 30 min of oocyte retrieval on the day of ovum pickup and on day 1 , day 2 and day 3 thereafter . 
 mild ohss was described as the presence of pelvic discomfort , abdominal distension , nausea vomiting and/or diarrhea and enlarged ovaries as seen on sonography ( 5 - 12 cm ) . 
 moderate ohss was described as the presence of features of mild ohss plus ultrasonic evidence of ascites in the pouch of douglas and pelvis and , enlarged ovaries . in the presence of severe ohss , a lady had features of moderate ohss plus evidence of ascites and/or hydrothorax and breathing difficulties . 
 in addition , there were changes in the blood volume , with increased blood viscosity due to hemoconcentration ( hematocrit > 45% ) , coagulation abnormality and diminished renal perfusion and function ( low urine output < 600 ml/24 h ) . 
 all the patients ( from both the study groups ) after the day of oocyte recovery were monitored daily by clinical examination and a transvaginally sonography . 
 calcium gluconate infusion in the first group was instituted thereafter until the next 3 days . 
 the volume of ascitic fluid drained daily and the changes in hematological parameters in the hospitalized subjects were recorded . 
 the patients even after completion of calcium gluconate infusion protocol or cb2 protocol were monitored on an out - patient basis until complete resolution of signs and symptoms . 
 the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of ohss in both the treatment groups . assuming the incidence of ohss as 5% with 90% power along with 6% permissible error , the minimum required sample size was estimated as 191 to detect the true difference between the two groups . 
 the  test and student 's t - test were used for statistical analysis with statistical package for the social sciences software , version 18.0 for windows .

 calcium gluconate infusion in the first group was instituted thereafter until the next 3 days . 
 hematological and biochemical profile was also carried out . any patient requiring any active intervention or who went into severe ohss 
 the volume of ascitic fluid drained daily and the changes in hematological parameters in the hospitalized subjects were recorded . 
 the patients even after completion of calcium gluconate infusion protocol or cb2 protocol were monitored on an out - patient basis until complete resolution of signs and symptoms . 
 the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the occurrence of ohss in both the treatment groups . assuming the incidence of ohss as 5% with 90% power along with 6% permissible error , the minimum required sample size was estimated as 191 to detect the true difference between the two groups . 
 the  test and student 's t - test were used for statistical analysis with statistical package for the social sciences software , version 18.0 for windows . 
 there were 202 women included in the study of which 98 were in group i and 104 belonged to group ii . 
 the mean female age was 28.1  3.3 years in group i whereas it was 28.2  3.3 years , in group ii ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 it was observed that there was no significant difference in terms of female age ( years ) , body mass index ( kg / m ) , duration of infertility ( years ) , basal hormone levels ( fsh [ miu / ml ] ) , basal antral follicle count , length of ovarian stimulation ( days ) , number of follicles on the day of hcg trigger and the number of oocytes retrieved in both the study groups [ table 1 ] . 
 fertilization rate , cleavage rate and implantation rate among the groups have not been evaluated and included as it was not part of the study as all the high risk patients underwent frozen embryo transfer . 
 comparison of clinical and laboratory characteristics in calcium gluconate - administered group ( group i ) and cabergoline group ( group ii ) statistical analysis also revealed that the number of women undergoing the first or the second ivf cycle were also comparable so was the history of ohss in the previous cycle in patients undergoing second cycle in both the study groups ( 24.5% vs. 26% ) [ table 2 ] . 
 comparison of cycle characteristics in the two treatment group the occurrence of ohss was seen in only nine patients ( 9.2% ) in the calcium infusion group , as compared to 16 patients ( 15.4% ) who were administered cb2 . 
 however , the rate of occurrence of ohss in both the study group was not found to be statistically significant . among the nine patients in the calcium infusion group who developed the complication only one had severe ohss , whereas two women were diagnosed as severe ohss belonging to the cb2 arm [ table 3 ] . 
 all the three women ( from both the study groups ) with severe ohss required hospitalization . 
 two patients from the cb2 group required ascitic tap due to massive ascites and breathing difficulties and one woman with severe ohss from group i required abdominal paracentesis . 
 these patients ' condition improved with supportive therapy and interventions such as abdominal paracentesis and were discharged once asymptomatic . 
 the patients with mild and moderate ohss from both the study groups were monitored on an out - patient basis until the resolution of signs and symptoms . none of the patients who were started on calcium gluconate injection developed any allergic reactions , anaphylaxis , symptoms or signs of hypercalcemia , or other side effects . 
 severity of ohss in the two study group ( n = number of patients with ohss in two arms ) 
 of the various pathophysiological mechanisms implicated for the causation of ohss , it is the angiogenic molecule , vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) , which has been found to be the biggest mediator of this potentially dreadful complication . 
 it has been proven that vegf stimulates new blood vessel development and vascular hyper permeability by interacting with its vegf receptor 2 ( vegfr-2 ) . 
 thus various studies were carried out , which have proven that dopamine agonists can inhibit phosphorylation of the receptor vegfr-2 and can thus reduce the vascular permeability and various presentations of ohss in the art cycles . in pursuance , 
 cb2 was therefore extensively studied and was found to bring about a decrease in the severity or incidence or both of ohss . 
 apart from the increased capillary permeability brought about by vegf which results in a fluid shift from the intravascular space to third space compartments the other contributing factors elucidated in the pathophysiology of ohss are : increased secretion or exudation of protein - rich fluid from enlarged ovaries or peritoneal surfaces , increased follicular fluid levels of prorenin and renin and increased angiotensin - mediated changes in capillary permeability . thus the effectiveness and safety of dual renin - angiotensin system blockage for prevention of ohss in over stimulated patients undergoing ivf was evaluated in a study . however , this new strategy for use in patients at high risk for ohss did not completely eliminate the development of the syndrome . 
 in addition , there were concerns about the safety of the treatment , as angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists were associated with possible teratogenic effect in humans . 
 nevertheless , this study did suggest the possible role of an altered renin angiotensin system in the development of ohss . another observation found in a separate study 
 was the stimulatory role of low intracellular calcium on adenylyl cyclase , which resulted in cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( camp ) synthesis and thus , renin release . 
 it was also postulated by beierwaltes that renin secretion is inversely related to the extracellular and intracellular calcium concentrations and therefore , calcium may modify the amplitude of camp - mediated renin - signaling pathways . 
 thus it was inferred that although calcium does not directly control renin secretion , increased calcium inhibits and decreased calcium amplifies camp - stimulated renin secretion . 
 gurgan et al . in their retrospective study also researched and found that calcium infusion successfully prevents the development of severe ohss and significantly decreases ohss occurrence rates without any major adverse effect when used for high - risk patients such as those with polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) . with the background of success , demonstrated by both cb2 and calcium for the prevention of this iatrogenic complication , we compared their efficacy . identifying patients who are at - risk 
 is the most critical step in the prevention of ohss as it guides a clinician to make changes to the ovarian stimulation regimen and to add other preventative measures . 
 predictive factors for ohss can be primary risk factors , which confer an increased risk of ohss on patients and secondary risk factors , which become apparent during ovarian stimulation when patients with no known predisposing factors experience an excessive response to treatment . in this study too , we incorporated these risk factors and targeted them to either of the preventive strategy . 
 it is noteworthy that in this study we compared the two drugs which ultimately targeted the same key molecule : vegf . 
 the pathway of reaching the target and the mode of administration of both the drugs might be different but the preventive mechanism was same , i.e. , either antagonizing vegf receptor as in cb2 or decrease vegf levels as with calcium gluconate infusion . 
 it has been hypothesized that calcium infusion for patients with high - risk factors for ohss , initially prevent renin secretion . 
 reduced renin production results in decreased angiotensin ii synthesis . as a consequence , the stimulatory effect of angiotensin ii on vegf production 
 all these pathophysiologic mechanisms ( decreased synthesis of renin , angiotensin ii and vegf ) which occurs from calcium gluconate infusion , therefore prevents the development of ohss in such high risk patients undergoing art cycles 
 . our results also document that calcium infusion can effectively prevent the development of severe ohss and decreases ohss occurrence rates without any major adverse affect when used for high - risk patients such as those with pcos . 
 it also needs to be reiterated that very few studies have been carried out on the efficacy of this new strategy of calcium gluconate infusion and comparison between this novel protocol and the established role of dopamine agonist is the first of its kind . 
 our observations in this present study was only limited to the occurrence of early onset of ohss in contrast to the findings of carizza et al . 
 as we carried out freezing of all the embryos so late onset of ohss was not evaluated . 
 we can say that even though both the drugs were found to be equally effective for the prevention of ohss and most importantly in decreasing the severity of this potentially life - threatening complication , their effect on the implantation process and the comparison of the pregnancy rate , implantation rate and miscarriage rate was not computed which accounts for the limitation of this study . 
 larger well designed trials need to be carried out incorporating the aforementioned factors as well as measurements of vegf levels in both the study groups . 
 nevertheless , as both the drugs are safe , cheap and have comparable success rates either of them can be employed as a treatment strategy for patients with high risk factors for ohss undergoing art cycles .","comparative study wherein high risk patients meeting strict inclusion exclusion criteria randomly divided two groups subjects group group ii

"a 24-year - old lady was referred to our pain clinic with complaint of abdominal pain for last 3 months . 
 she had her second cesarean section 4 months ago and her pain started one month after the surgery . 
 the pain was located around 5 - 7 cm inferior and lateral to umbilicus on the right side and was well localized in a circumferential manner without any radiation . 
 she described her pain as dull aching , stabbing and burning in nature and was severe while getting up from bed , climbing stairs and bending forward . 
 the patient rated her pain as 7/10 on visual analog scale ( vas ) during above mentioned activities . 
 she had pin - point tenderness just at the lateral border of rectus abdominis with allodynia and hyperalgesia . 
 she had been evaluated by her gynecologist earlier and found no abnormality on ultrasound abdomen . before coming to us 
 she had used non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , muscle relaxants , tramadol , gabapentin without any relief . 
 after ruling out intra - abdominal pathology by the evaluation of a laparoscopic surgeon , we suspected acnes as there was pin - point tenderness around lateral border of rectus and a positive carnett test ( tensing the abdominal muscles by elevating the head and shoulder in prone position lead to increase in pain ) . 
 after consent and under strict asepsis , we used high frequency linear probe ( 6 - 13 mhz , m - turbo , sonosite , bothell , wa , usa ) to give rectus sheath block . 
 but she did n't allow us to put the probe for rectus sheath block as she had tremendous tenderness . 
 probe was placed lateral to rectus sheath where all three layers of abdominal muscles were clearly seen . 
 a combination of methyl prednisolone 20 mg and 6 ml of 0.375% ropivacaine was injected between the fascial layer of internal oblique and transversus abdominis using a 22 gauge echogenic needle ( sonotap , pajunk , geisingen , germany ) utilizing in - plane approach . 
 patient reported same pain five hours later but she started getting relief 3 - 4 days later possibly because of the depo - steroid . 
 twelve months after the injection she continues to experience almost complete pain relief and is back to normal life . 
 the second lady was of 30-years and came to us with 7 months history of chronic abdominal pain similar to the previous lady i.e. pain after 1 month of the second cesarean section . 
 she had pinpoint tenderness at two places viz . at the lateral border of rectus sheath corresponding to t11 and t12 dermatome . 
 she initially responded to gabapentin and tramadol but the pain relief did n't last long and was keen for the injection . 
 we performed tap block lateral to the rectus sheath after which she had very good pain relief ( 80% ) . on 
 follow up , after one month , she complained of pain at the lower part closer to surgical scar but there was no pain at the previous painful area . 
 this time we repeated a similar tap block with probe position little down to the previous block location . 
 she had complete relief and without any further injection 6 months down the line till the writing of this report .

 this time we repeated a similar tap block with probe position little down to the previous block location . 
 she had complete relief and without any further injection 6 months down the line till the writing of this report . 
 the purpose of above communication is to have high index of suspicion for acnes as the cause of abdominal wall pain and application of ultrasound guided tap block for the treatment of this pain . 
 history , proper physical examination and a positive carnett test in the absence of any other intra - abdominal pathology should raise the suspicion of acnes . 
 complete pain relief to a diagnostic nerve block with local anaesthetic usually establishes the diagnosis . in literature 
 , there is description of blind , trigger point injections at neural foraminal level where the nerve enters the rectus abdominis muscle . 
 though blind injections dominated for a long time , there is a recent report on ultrasound guided rectus sheath block for the same diagnosis . as our patient did not allow us for a rectus sheath block because of severe tenderness , we tried tap block and it was totally successful . 
 we did not go for the classic description of the tap block , in stead injected the anaesthetic in the transversus abdominis plane closer to the rectus muscle , so that the drug is deposited very near to the entrapped site . despite the increasing use of tap block for perioperative analgesia for hysterectomy , cesarean section , laparoscopic surgeries , there is very sparse literature on chronic pain application . 
 both of our patients responded to single injections , except the second patient requiring second injection for the lowermost tender point . 
 tap block under ultrasound guidance may offer a diagnostic possibility for patients with cawp to confirm acnes . 
 this approach may serve as an alternative , safe , effective and reliable method to blind injection or in patients with severe pain and tenderness for probe placement at rectus sheath area .","nt allow us put probe rectus sheath block tremendous tenderness

 the syndrome is mostly misdiagnosed , treated wrongly and inadequately . 
 if diagnosed correctly by history , examination and a positive carnett test , the suffering of the patient can be relieved by addressing the cause i.e. local anaesthetic with steroid injection at the entrapment site . 
 conventionally , the injection is done by landmark technique . in this report , we have described 2 patients who were diagnosed with acnes who were offered ultrasound guided transverses abdominis plane ( tap ) injection who got significant pain relief for a long duration of time ."
"the past and present periods of large - scale genome sequencing have brought an enormous wealth of protein sequences that makes managing , navigating and mining the data an area of research in its own right . 
 mutations , insertions and deletions create sequence diversity inside a domain family . on a higher level , 
 recombination events combine domains in different architectures to give the single- or multi - domain proteins we observe . 
 various invaluable tools exist to reduce the diversity of proteins into a reduced set of protein domain families . 
 semi - automated methods such as pfam ( 1 ) , prosite ( 2 ) or smart ( 3 ) extrapolate the information gained from known members of protein domain families by matching sequences to libraries of hidden markov models ( hmms ) , profiles or patterns . 
 integrative projects such as interpro ( 4 ) combine various primary sources to yield a summary view on protein sequences . 
 fully automated methods such as prodom ( 5 ) or domo ( 6 ) apply algorithms to achieve a classification based on first principles . 
 previously , we have introduced the automatic domain decomposition algorithm ( adda ) ( 7 ) , a method for clustering very large sets of protein sequences . 
 adda first splits sequences into domains and then organizes these domains into protein domain families . 
 the classification is constructed in an entirely automated fashion from first principles and thus is not biased by human curation , but only limited by the applied algorithms . 
 we have applied adda to the set of all known protein sequences that are available in the major public databases . 
 using all sequences for clustering has the advantage of drawing the boundaries between protein domain families in a globally consistent manner . 
 this is in contrast to scanning methods such as pfam and smart , where novel or hypothetical sequences are scanned against a library of hmms or profiles . 
 matches at the borderline of significance can be due to a newly discovered remote relative or to spurious similarity . in such events , 
 , we describe a database with a web interface that allows scientists to download and browse the results . 
 the web interface lets a scientist explore the context of a protein sequence in the protein universe : its immediate neighbours as determined by pre - computed sequence similarity searches , and its remote homologues as determined by its domain composition . 
 alternatively , a scientist can browse the domain families to hunt for domain families of interest . 
 the database contains more than 1.5 million sequences from uniprot / swiss - prot , uniprot / trembl ( 8) , ensembl ( 9 ) , ncbi genomes ( 10 ) and other sources of protein sequences . 
 the clustering yields 2.7 million domains , which are grouped into 123  000 families . of these , 40  000 
 the domain and domain family definitions result from an automated clustering procedure applied to the set of all protein sequences in the major public databases . 
 the process starts by removing sequences with > 40% sequence identity to any other sequence from the input set ( 11 ) . 
 the remaining representative sequences are then aligned in an all - versus - all manner using the blast ( 12 ) program . 
 domains are defined so that a minimum number of alignments are intersected by domain boundaries and these alignments cover domains as much as possible . after splitting protein sequences , the resultant domains are grouped into families of related sequences by a single - linkage clustering algorithm . 
 domains joined by alignments are grouped into a family if their domain boundaries are consistent . 
 finally , domain boundaries are mapped from the representative sequences onto all sequences in the database . 
 quality control monitors two aspects of the clustering by comparing adda domains to curated databases of domain families like pfam and scop ( 13 ) . 
 the correspondence of domain boundaries is checked by computing the relative overlap between adda and reference domains . 
 adda tends to split conservatively ; adda domains are , on average , larger than reference domains . 
 the correspondence of domain families is measured by matching each adda family to the best matching reference family and counting the relative frequency of other reference families in the adda family ( selectivity ) and the relative frequency of reference domains assigned to different adda families ( sensitivity ) . on average , 
 an adda domain family unifies 93% of the members of a pfam family while containing only 5% contamination . 
 in multi - domain proteins , domains of different protein families co - occur . based on the observed architecture of protein sequences 
 , domain families can be divided into two groups : mobile modules and associated families . 
 associated families either always occur in single - domain proteins or are always associated with the same domain family . in the present release , there are 9252 mobile modules and 49  455 associated families ( figure 1a ) . 
 while the latter tend to be specific to a single kingdom ( archaea , bacteria and eukaryota ) , mobile modules have a larger taxonomic range ( figure 1b ) . 
 a domain family is declared to be structurally covered if one of its domains can be mapped onto a structure in the pdb database of protein structures ( 14 ) . for each adda domain 
 , we register the sequence overlap with domains from curated domain databases ( pfam , scop and interpro ) . 
 an adda domain family is classified as novel if < 5% of its domains overlap with domains from the curated domain databases . 
 adda contains 3828 novel mobile modules that are not known to curated domain databases and for which there is no structural information available ( figure 1c ) . 
 novel domain families tend to have fewer members ( < 200 ) than well - known domain families . 
 the number of novel domains in associated families is even larger comprising 40  505 domain families . 
 the interface allows the user to query for protein sequences by identifier , accession number or sequence similarity . 
 links allow the user to browse similar sequences in the direct neighbourhood of a query sequence ( multiple alignments pre - computed using blast and psi - blast ) and to switch to the domain families to get all related sequences beyond the immediate neighbourhood . 
 attributes available for querying are the size of the family , its taxonomic spread , its structural coverage , the number of associated domains ( querying for mobile modules ) , the overlap with other domain classifications ( querying for novel domain families ) and others . the domain family view includes a summary overview over the protein family and links to other domain classifications . 
 the sequences of all domains in a domain family can be downloaded for local analysis . 
 if structures are known in the family , the domain boundaries are mapped onto the structures for visualization with rasmol ( 15 ) . in the browsing section 
 , the user finds links to precompiled domain sets of interest , e.g. all exclusively eukaryotic mobile domains or a list of domain families without known structures ( structural genomics targets ) . 
 in addition , a genome browser allows access to all or a selection of domain families occurring in a genome . 
 for example , adda is linked to by the dali domain database ( 16 ) and vice versa . 
 links and attributes can be queried in numerous ways . one application of the database interface is to hunt for novel domain families . for example , typing 
 sapiens into the genome browser lists 28  791 domain families in human protein sequences . 
 the result set can be restricted to exclude domain families that have domains from archaea or bacteria and/or are not novel and not a mobile module giving 7933 domain families . modifying the query to include only domains with more than 20 members produces 108 novel domain families that occur in human protein sequences , are specific to eukaryotes and have at least 20 members . 
 our aim is to push the functional annotation of proteins as far as possible using only automated methods . 
 we are currently testing methods to split domain families into groups of orthologous proteins and automated methods to define functionally important residues in a family .","adda first splits sequences domains organizes domains protein domain families

 in particular , there are 3828 novel domain families that do not overlap with the curated domain databases pfam , scop and interpro . 
 the data are freely available for downloading and querying via a web interface ( http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi:9801/sqgraph/pairsdb ) ."
"before the third edition of dsm , substance and alcohol dependency were considered as symptoms of personality disorders ( pds ) . however , in the third edition , drug consumption was identified as  substance use disorders  ( sud ) ( 1 ) . from then on , 
 psychologic comorbidities have been viewed as an important subject in drug consumption ( 2 ) . 
 the pds are rigid , inflexible , and maladaptive behavior patterns , which are severe enough to cause significant impairments in functioning or internal distress . 
 they are enduring and persistent style of behavior and thought , not atypical episodes ( 3 ) . 
 the high prevalence of dsm - iv pds among those with suds was evidently indicated in the research literature ( 4 , 5 ) . a recent literature review ( 6 ) summarized prevalence rates and concluded that estimates of the overall axis ii prevalence range from 34% to 73% in treated substance users , with and borderline pds as the most prevalent ones . 
 a short review on previous studies revealed individuals with certain pds , especially the antisocial pd , were more prone to sud ( 7 - 9 ) , and persons dependent to different types of drugs showed more pds comorbidity ( 10 , 11 ) . 
 one meta - analyze has shown that patients under medical treatment for sud display more comorbidity with pds than normal individuals do ( 12 ) . 
 ( 13 ) showed the chronic drug consumers had higher scores in schizoid pd and antisocial pd than the functional consumers did . 
 ( 14 ) found the most frequently diagnosed pds in heroin substance users undergoing methadone maintenance treatment were antisocial and borderline pd . in addition , grana et al . 
 ( 13 ) found that antisocial and schizoid traits are the most outstanding traits of heroin substance users and multidrug consumers . 
 however , cocaine use ( 15 ) is often associated with psychiatric comorbidity such as antisocial pd ( 24% ) , major depressive disorder ( 18% ) , and posttraumatic stress disorder ( 12% ) . 
 applying millon clinical multi - axial inventory - iii ( mcmi - iii ) , craig ( 16 ) focused on range of pds in 443 individuals with drug dependency . in both groups , antisocial ( 60% ) , passive - aggressive ( 34% ) , and depressive pds ( 32% ) 
 were the most prevalent pds . in a study on heroin users in taiwan , 58.5% of men and 
 62.5% of women had at least one axis - i psychiatric disorder or antisocial pd ( 17 ) . 
 it is generally accepted that substance users prefer drugs that have best effects on healing their personality problems and use other kind of drugs only when they are deprived of the preferred ones ( 6 , 18 ) . 
 evident reveals that drugs may be choose by a substance user due to their self - medicating effects ( 19 ) . 
 robbins ( 20 ) points out that substance users use drug to reduce their social anxieties . 
 however , these suggestions about the specific association between psychological problems and drug choosing have not been scrutinized . 
 yet drugs are the most powerful means to change one s mental state because of their effects on minimizing psychological problems . some patients abuse drugs to reduce anxieties , irritation , and depression . 
 therefore , in cases of self - medication , it would be better to consider a proper plan to solve fundamental problems ( 19 ) . 
 this study aimed to determine the association between pds and types of drugs in iranian substance users . 
 the pds of cluster b , especially borderline and antisocial pds , and sud and its intensity were studied largely in previous studies . 
 no research has concentrated on comparing narcotics ( including opium , shireh , heroin , and crack , a kind of compacted heroin made in iran ) with stimulants ( as amphetamine , methamphetamine and cocaine ) in iran . 
 undoubtedly , any knowledge about the personal characteristic of these groups of drug users sheds new lights on the more effective medical and psychological treatment for better outcomes . 
 thus , if routine personality assessment improves outcomes of sud treatment , the clinical implication will be increasing the use of pd assessment in sud treatment settings ( 21 ) . 
 current study was a correlation study . to determine the sample size , the cochran s sample size formula for correlation studies ( 22 ) was used ( equation 1 , in which t = 1.96 , p = 0.5 , q = 0.5 , and d = 0.11 ) . the minimum sample size needed to obtain statistically valid results was 79 , and we added 51 more samples to obtain higher validity . 
 the samples were male substance users aging 18 to 45 years , who met the dsm - v ( 23 ) criteria for suds and were in diverse treatment programs such as methadone maintenance therapy , buprenorphine therapy , and detoxification in private clinics for substance use treatment . 
 the sample group was 260 substance users , 130 narcotics dependents and 130 stimulant dependents . 
 private clinics of substance dependency treatment were classified into four groups of north , east , west , and south clinics in tehran , iran . then in each region , two clinics were selected conveniently regarding the clinic manager s tendency to participation in the study . 
 thus , patients were recruited from centers for substance dependency treatment in four regions of tehran . 
 patients were recruited by general practitioners ( gps ) working in these centers until the required sample was reached , without a quota of patients assigned for each center . 
 the inclusion criteria were as follows : being male , 18 age of to 65 years , being able to understand and read persian language , and willing to participate in the study . 
 exclusion criteria included schizophrenia and psychosis , incomplete questionnaire , and relapse in the preceding two days . 
 receiving medical treatment was not an exclusion criterion ; however , treatment was not modified or increased during the study period . 
 diagnosis of drug dependency was made with structured interview according to addiction severity index ( asi ) and confirmation of the technical manager of the clinic , who were mostly gps or psychiatrists . 
 all of participants filed out mcmi - iii to assess type of drug and pds . 
 then , a psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist confirmed the result from mcmi - iii by interviewing the patient . 
 1 ) asi : the asi is a semi - structured interview for substance abuse assessment and treatment planning . the asi is designed to gather valuable information about areas of a client s life that may contribute to their substance - abuse problems . the asi was developed in 1980 by a. thomas mclellan , along with collaborators from the university of pennsylvania s center for the studies of addiction . 
 the asi was the first standardized assessment tool of its kind to measure the multiple dimensions of substance abuse . 
 it has three categories : 1 ) socio - demographic : sex , age , years of education , and main source of income ; 2 ) consumption : main substance , type of treatments , and years of consumption ; and 3 ) severity of dependency . 
 overall , studies typically conclude that the asi is a consistent and accurate tool for assessing clients and their substance abuse issues . 
 the asi is able to successfully identify the client s problem area in which they are experiencing the greatest difficulties , such as alcohol or drug addiction , or legal or familial problems . 
 once a client s psychosocial issues are identified , an appropriate course of treatment should be administered . 
 severity ratings are based on the following ten - point scale ( range , 0 - 9 ) : 0 - 1 , no real problem ; treatment is not indicated . 
 2 - 3 , slight problem ; probably treatment is not necessary . 4 - 5 , moderate problem ; 
 the severity ratings scale allows the interviewer to determine the severity of a client s problem . 
 the higher the score is , the greater the need for treatment in each area or immediate intervention will be . 
 the asi scores can be used to profile a client s problem areas and then plan an effective course of treatment ( 24 ) . 
 2 ) mcmi - iii : the mcmi - iii is a psychologic assessment tool intended to provide information on psychopathology , including specific disorders outlined in the dsm - iv . it is intended for adults (  18 years old ) with at least an eighth - grade reading levels who are currently seeking mental health services . the mcmi was developed and standardized specifically on clinical populations , ie , patients in psychiatric hospitals or people with existing mental health problems , and the authors are very specific that it should not be used with the general population or adolescents ( 25 ) . however , there is a strong evidence that shows it still retains validity on non - clinical populations . 
 the mcmi differs from other personality tests in that it is based on theory and is organized according to a multi - axial format . 
 updates to each version of the mcmi coincide with revisions to the dsm ( 26 ) . 
 it is composed of 175 true / false questions that reportedly take 25 to 30 minutes to complete . 
 it was developed by theodore millon , carrie millon , roger davis , and seth grossman ( 27 ) . 
 the test is modeled on four scales : 14 personality disorder scales ; 10 clinical syndrome scales ; five correction scales including three modifying indices ( which determine the patient 's response style and can detect random responding ) and two random response indicators ; and 42 grossman s personality facet scales , based on seth grossman 's theories of personality and psychopathology . 
 the mcmi - iii was updated in 2008 , with a new norming sample of 752 individuals ( 52.8% female ; 76% caucasian ) with a wide range of clinical disorders . 
 the scale development stage consisted of 600 of these individuals ( 48.8% male ; 84% caucasian ) , and the cross - validation stage consisted of the remaining 398 individuals ( 49.5% male , 81.7% caucasian ) ( 28 ) . 
 they are broken down further into 11 basic clinical personality patterns ( scales 1 through 8b ) and three severe personality pathology scales ( scales s through p ) ( table 1 ) . 
 the final validation stage includes convergent and discriminative validity of the test , which is assessed by correlating the test with similar / dissimilar instruments . 
 positive predictive value is the likelihood of being right given a test positive , which ranged from 0.30 ( masochistic ) to 0.81 ( dependent ) . 
 sensitivity or the proportion of individuals that have a condition and are correctly identified ranged from 0.44 ( negativistic ) to 0.92 ( paranoid ) . 
 patients ' raw scores are converted to base rate ( br ) scores to allow comparison between the personality indices . 
 the br scores are essentially where each score fits on a scale of 1 through 115 , with the median score of 60 . 
 conversion to a br score is relatively complex , and there are certain corrections that are administered based on each patient 's response style . 
 the modifying indices are scored using a complex system in which the patient 's responses in the other scales are compared and the raw and br scores are taken from this . 
 however , the invalidity index is an exception and is not converted to a br score ( 25 - 27 ) . in iran , 
 before they give their consent , the patients were provided with a general overview of the aims and characteristics of the study . 
 they were also informed that they were participating voluntarily , and that they could choose to withdraw at any time with the guarantee that they will continue to receive the treatment considered most appropriate by their clinic . 
 the study was approved by the ethical review board of the behavioral sciences research center of shahid beheshti university of medical sciences , tehran , iran ( 11.12.2013 ; ref : pi10/039 ) . 
 the results were used anonymously and all of the data were kept confidential in this study . 
 the statistics were analyzed both descriptively and inferentially . applying pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression in the inferential part , hypothesis of the research were examined .

 the statistics were analyzed both descriptively and inferentially . applying pearson correlation coefficient and linear regression in the inferential part , hypothesis of the research were examined . 
 the average age of the stimulant and narcotics dependents was respectively 28.8 and 33.1 years . 
 half of the narcotic dependents were married ( n = 67 ) , one was divorced , and the rest were single ( n = 63 ) . in stimulant dependents , 
 most of stimulant dependents were single while the married and single ones were nearly equal in narcotic dependents . 
 most of narcotic and stimulant dependents had diploma ( certificate for secondary education graduates in iran ) or were secondary education undergraduates . 
 in addition , frequency of narcotic dependents with diploma , associate degree , and bachelor degree was lower than that of stimulant dependents .   in order to explore the association between pds and type of used drugs , 
 pearson correlation coefficient was applied with the results presented in two ways : for each pd and for each cluster .   as is shown in table 2 
 , there was a significant correlation between stimulant consumption and histrionic pd ( p < 0.001 ) , and antisocial pd and narcissistic pd ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 in addition , there were significant correlations between narcotic consumption and histrionic , narcissistic , and avoidant ( p < 0.05 for all ) , antisocial , borderline , and depressive pds ( p < 0.001 for all ) . 
 according to table 3 , examining correlation coefficients between each cluster and type of drug revealed a significant correlation between cluster b and narcotics and stimulant consumption ( p < 0.001 ) . on the other hand 
 , the table shows a significant correlation between cluster c and narcotic consumption ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the results of linear regression in table 4 shows that avoidant , histrionic , narcissistic , depressive , antisocial , and borderline pds play significant role in narcotic consumption . 
 the aim of this study was to determine the association between pds and types of drugs in iranian male drug users . 
 the research findings revealed that there was a significant association between pds in cluster b and both narcotic and stimulant consumption , while pds in cluster a had no significant association with narcotic and stimulant consumption . on the other hand , pds in cluster c also showed significant association only with narcotics ( e.g. opium , heroin , and crack in iran ) consumption . 
 as it was suggested , analyzing the association between certain types of drugs with each pd proved that narcotic consumption was associated with histrionic , borderline , depressive , avoidant , antisocial , and narcissistic pds , and stimulant usage was associated with narcissistic , antisocial , and histrionic pds . 
 study of pds and drug of choice in a meta - analysis indicated that borderline and antisocial pds in stimulant users , dependent , avoidant , schizoid , and borderline pds in narcotics users , and in general , histrionic and narcissistic pds were prevalent among patients with sud ( 6 , 30 ) . 
 for example , antisocial and borderline pds , as the most common pds in patients with sud ( 6 ) , have comorbidity of 18% and 17% , respectively ( 31 ) , and half of patients consuming buprenorphine have borderline pd ( 32 ) . 
 cluster b and c  are the most common comorbidities in heroin users ( 33 - 38 ) . 
 on the other hand , cocaine users show more characteristics of schizoid and avoidant traits ( 39 ) , or antisocial pd ( 19 ) . 
 it can be said that individuals in cluster c have different reasons for their tendency to narcotics in comparison with individuals in cluster b. in fact , persons in cluster b because of their illegal behavior ( 40 ) , and persons in cluster c due to their low self - esteem , self - dependency , self - sufficiency , and inferiority in social association are drown to narcotics consumption ( 41 ) . 
 some studies have proved that heroin users are more impulsive and aggressive than cocaine users ( 42 , 43 ) , while other have expressed no significant difference in personality traits between cocaine and heroin ( 44 ) or cannabis abusers ( 45 ) . 
 researches consistently have provided the evidence of higher impulsivity and emotional instability in multi - drug abusers , and they had higher levels of antisocial , borderline , and passive aggressive pds ( 41 ) . 
 others have signified that narcotic users share characteristics including irresponsibility , snobbishness , ignoring others , and have pds , especially antisocial and histrionic pds ( 46 ) . 
 other enquiries have shown that personality characteristics including reclusiveness , being antisocial , sensitive , and anxious , irresponsibility , and poor social adjustment and empathy are associated with risky behaviors such as drug use as a way to overcome negative moods and feelings ( 47 ) . 
 most surveys have concluded that behaviors such as risky sexual behaviors and shared injections are associated with the above - mentioned characteristics ( 48 ) . 
 ( 49 ) argued that risky behaviors are in fact , an attempts to reduce anxiety levels and obtain transitory tranquility and pain relief , which are resulted from negative emotions and feelings . 
 these results suggest that most people who drink alcohol hazardously , or use drugs such as cocaine , marijuana , heroin and other narcotics have anxiety , isolation , and loneliness ( 50 ) . 
 armstrong and costello ( 51 ) found that 60% of drug users , drug abusers , and drug dependents have comorbid pds . 
 as long as having a psychiatric disorder ( 52 , 53 ) , especially pds ( 6 , 54 ) , can significantly increase the risk of relapse , drop out , or poorer treatment outcomes , these patients need more specific treatment plans ( 55 - 57 ) .   in conclusion , results of the present research were in accordance with previous ones in terms of pds and types of consumed drugs . 
 antisocial and borderline pds are prevalent in stimulant users , avoidant , dependent , schizoid , and borderline pds in alcohol and narcotic users , and in general , histrionic and narcissistic pds are prevalent in those with suds . in general , 34.8% to 73% of the treated substance users have comorbid pds ( 6 ) . 
 according to craig ( 16 ) , compton et al . ( 58 ) , and grant et al . 
 ( 59 ) , in each group , the prevalence of antisocial pd was significant . 
 armstrong and costello ( 51 ) acknowledged the findings in teenagers . in this research , in comparison with stimulant consumption , narcotic consumption had higher rate of pds . 
 finally , this conclusion could be drawn that self - medication effects of narcotics , due to the pain relieving and anxiety - reducing characteristics , can cover more pds , while stimulants have more limited self - medicating effects . 
 the current study was the first study conducted on both narcotics and stimulant users about pds on iranian population ; however , it study has some limitations . 
 for instance , it has been conducted on men in tehran and can not be generalized to women or substance users of other cities . 
 it included population between 18 to 45 years old and can not generalize the results to teenagers or elderly . the same study can be conducted on women , teenagers , and population in other cities .","short review previous studies revealed individuals certain pds especially antisocial pd prone sud persons dependent different types drugs showed pds comorbidity

"a total of 2.78 million tickets were sold to the london paralympic games , making the paralympic games the world s third biggest sporting event , after the olympic games and the fifa world cup . 
 the movement is genuinely global174 countries have national paralympic committees  and participation is increasing , with > 6000 internationally registered athletes in the sport of athletics alone . 
 classification systems are integral to paralympic sport , being used to determine eligibility and control for the impact of eligible impairment types on the outcome of competition . 
 valid classification systems facilitate competition in which the athletes who succeed are not simply those who have less severe impairments than their competitors , but those who have the most favorable combination of athletic attributes and have enhanced them to best effect . 
 classification that is not valid or that is not perceived to be valid poses a significant threat to paralympic sport . at the elite level , 
 the legitimacy of an individual s competitive success or athletic achievement can be significantly diminished by the perception that they are in the wrong class , with the potential for considerable personal and financial costs , as well as for discrediting the movement . at the grass - roots level , 
 a classification system that is perceived to be unfair will discourage participation among people with disabilities , rather than achieve the goal of increasing it . 
 evidence - based decision making in classification is an essential means of enhancing classification validity , but evidence underpinning current methods of classification is weak . in 2007 
 the international paralympic committee ( ipc ) mandated the development of evidence - based methods of classification for all paralympic sports and the ipc position stand on classification outlines key requirements for the development of evidence - based systems , including valid , reliable methods for assessing impairment . 
 research in this area is limited ; however , researchers are beginning to investigate the methods that may contribute to evidence - based classification in paralympic sport . 
 impairments classified in paralympic sport include impaired muscle strength , impaired range of movement , and limb deficiency . 
 the focus of this article is impaired muscle strength , which is required in 16 of the 23 summer paralympic sports , and is a key component of classification in athletics ( ie , track and field ) , the largest paralympic sport . 
 methods for assessing strength have remained essentially unchanged since the first classification system was described by sir ludwig guttman . 
 they are based on manual muscle testing ( mmt ) methods in which the strength of individual muscle actions ( eg , elbow flexion , knee extension ) are assigned a grade from 0 ( no voluntary muscle contraction ) to 5 ( normal strength through normal anatomical range of movement ) according to their capacity to overcome gravity and/or manual resistance . 
 for the purposes of classification , mmt has a number of advantages : it is widely understood and utilized in clinical practice and , because it does not require any instrumentation , it is inexpensive and space - efficient . 
 one final advantage of using mmt for classification is that the ability to overcome manual resistance is assessed using the break test , an isometric contraction against manual resistance . 
 isometric assessments are advantageous for classification purposes because they are known to be relatively unresponsive to the high - speed , dynamic strength training regimes required for performance enhancement in athletics . as a consequence , athletes who have optimized sports performance through high - speed , dynamic resistance training are less likely to change their classification strength measures and be placed into a class for athletes with less severe impairments . 
 unfortunately mmt also has several important disadvantages that make it unsuitable as a method of strength assessment for classification . 
 first , acceptable interrater reliability is difficult to achieve , a problem exacerbated by the wide range of mmt techniques that are described in published literature and used by classifiers from different countries in their clinical practice . 
 for example , an athlete with full passive range of motion but only 15 degrees of active elbow extension against gravity is likely to experience much more activity limitation in the shot put than an athlete with 100 degrees active range , and yet the correct muscle grade for both actions is 2 . 
 ordinal measurement scales are unsuitable for research that aims to develop evidence - based methods of classification , as mandated by the international paralympic committee . 
 specifically , evidence - based methods of classification require quantification of the relative importance of different muscle actions in a given sporting movement , and therefore a ratio - scale measure of strength is necessary . 
 when the relative importance of key muscle actions has been quantified using a ratio - scale measure , it will be possible to validly aggregate strength measures of contributing muscle groups in order to obtain an evidence - based estimate of how much activity limitation different strength impairments will cause , regardless of their distribution and severity . in order to permit the development of evidence - based methods of classification , our research group developed a battery of novel strength tests . 
 key features of the battery were that measures were isometric and therefore , according to theory , less training responsive than other dynamic strength tests ; instrumented , yielding an outcome measure in newtons ( a ratio scale ) ; comprehensive , assessing all muscle actions of importance in the key disciplines of paralympic athletics ( wheelchair racing , running , throwing , and jumping ) ; and parsimonious , by assessing compound ( or multijoint actions ) and thereby minimizing the number of tests required and ensuring that individual tests accounted for the greatest possible variance in performance . 
 the aims of this study were 3-fold : to establish normal performance ranges for each of the novel tests in nondisabled participants , to evaluate the reliability of each of the novel tests , and to assess the strength of association between individual test outcomes and body mass . in relation to the final aim , a sufficiently strong relationship with body size would indicate that , prior to applying these methods in classification , it may be necessary to develop body - size scaling methods that can be validly applied to measures obtained from athletes with neuromusculoskeletal impairments . 
 participants were 118 nondisabled , males ( n  =  63 ) and females ( n  =  55 ) , ages 18 to 37 ( mean    sd 23.2    3.7 ) recruited from the university of queensland and local sports clubs . 
 all were regularly active in competitive sport or engaged in 3 or more vigorous training sessions per week . 
 the study was approved by the ethics committee of the school of human movement studies , university of queensland ( number hms07/0406 ) and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation . 
 participants completed testing in a single session , with the exception of 17 who returned in a minimum of 2 days and a maximum of 14 days from the initial session , so that test 
 the sample size calculation was based on the requirement for calculation of allometric scaling exponents and a minimum number of 54 participants were required in each group ( males and females ) at an effect size of 0.15 with power set at 0.8 and probability at 0.05 . 
 all participants completed a battery of 7 isometric strength tests  grip strength and 6 novel tests  which are presented in table 1 . 
 the battery aimed to be both parsimonious and comprehensive , using the smallest possible number of tests to evaluate the strength of those movements considered most important in the key athletic disciplines ( ie , running , jumping , throwing , and wheelchair propulsion ) . 
 strength and body size test protocols grip strength was assessed using a handheld dynamometer ( smedlay s dynamometer , fabrication enterprises , white plains , ny , usa , 100  kg ) , with values entered directly to excel 2007 spreadsheet ( microsoft , redmond , wa , usa ) and then converted to newtons ( n ) . 
 the 6 novel tests were completed with the participant seated in a customized strength rig ( figure 1 ) . 
 the rig comprised a rigid , aluminum rectangular frame with an s - type load cell ( scale components , slacks creek , qld , australia ) rated to 394  kg ( 1000  lb ) mounted at one end , opposite a rigid seat . 
 an aluminium plate ( 250  mm    196  mm    12  mm ) was secured to the load cell and , once seated , participants applied force to the load cell from a seated position by either pushing or pulling on the plate . 
 three features of the rig permitted positioning of participants so that force was applied to the load cell from anatomically standardized positions : the load cell was adjustable vertically and horizontally to account for individual differences in sitting height and breadth ( see figure 1 , panel b ) ; the seat position was adjustable in the fore - aft direction to account for individual differences in arm and leg length ( see figure 1 , panel a ) ; backrest height was adjustable to permit positioning at the c7 vertebra regardless of the participant s sitting height . 
 the arrow indicates the ability of the chair to move in the fore - aft direction . 
 panel b shows a magnified view of the load cell set up with arrows indicating the ability to move the load cell vertically and horizontally . 
 the joint angles selected for each testing position aimed to position prime movers so that , as far as possible , length / tension relationships were optimized . to achieve the precise leg angles described in table 1 
 , an anthropometric marking pen was used to clearly identify the following landmarks : acromion , greater trochanter , mid - point of lateral knee joint line , and the lateral malleolus . a sony camera , positioned 1.5  m from the rig , in line with the mid - point of the seat surface at 1  m high , fed a live , sagittal view video image of the participant seated in the strength rig into a personal computer , on which dartfish ( version 4.0.9.0 ; dartfish , lausanne , switzerland ) was installed . 
 the dartfish angle tool was used to draw the required joint angles and the strength rig could then be adjusted until the participant was positioned so that their video image was matched with image created by the angle tool . 
 this method could not be used for the arm angles which are only observable from an overhead view , and these angles were set using a handheld goniometer ( sunshine diagnostic and measuring instruments , new taipei city , taiwan ) and monitored visually by a member of the testing team .

 panel a illustrates the position that participants were placed into for the bilateral supported arm push . 
 panel b illustrates the position that participants were placed into for the leg extensor strength test . once positioned , participants performed 3 maximal isometric contractions of 5  seconds duration , each separated by 30  seconds of rest . 
 valid trials required peak force to be achieved slowly ( > 2  seconds and <3  seconds ) followed by a 3-second hold at peak . to assist participants 
 achieve peak force slowly , 2 submaximal practice trials were performed with real - time visual feedback of the force  time curve so that participants could easily identify when maximum force was achieved either too quickly or too slowly . 
 participants applied force with their hand(s ) for upper limb tests and with their foot / feet for lower limb tests , with the rigid backrest permitting exertion of maximal voluntary force . 
 hands / feet were positioned so that force was directed through the long axis of the load cell and torque was minimized . 
 load cell output was captured by musclelab v4020e ( ergotest , porsgunn , norway ) at a sampling rate of 100  hz . 
 raw isometric strength scores were exported directly into an excel 2007 spreadsheet from the load cell data acquisition program ( musclelab ) , and all trials were then processed in scilab using a custom - written algorithm ( scilab enterprises , versailles , france ) to acquire the peak isometric force from each trial . for each trial , 
 the isometric force used for further analysis was calculated as the mean force over the 2-second period with the least variability . to ensure a plateau 
 was achieved , a trial was deemed acceptable if the calculated force was a minimum of 95% of the peak force registered during the trial . 
 body mass was measured and recorded on each participant to the nearest 0.1  kg using scales ( seca 760 mechanical scales , seca , hamburg , germany ) . 
 all data were analyzed using spss v16 ( spss inc , chicago , il ) . 
 independent t - tests were performed on the strength data of males and females to determine whether strength tests were significantly affected by sex and should be analyzed separately . test

 the relationship between body mass and each of the strength measures was determined by calculating pearson correlations and allometric scaling exponents . to calculate the latter , 
 a log - linear regression analysis was conducted using strength as the dependent variable and body mass as the independent variable . 
 the slope of the regression line was used as the allometric scaling exponent , and residual plots were assessed to check the fit of each model . 
 exponents were calculated on the dominant side for the upper body and the right side for the lower body .

 body mass was measured and recorded on each participant to the nearest 0.1  kg using scales ( seca 760 mechanical scales , seca , hamburg , germany ) . 
 all data were analyzed using spss v16 ( spss inc , chicago , il ) . 
 independent t - tests were performed on the strength data of males and females to determine whether strength tests were significantly affected by sex and should be analyzed separately . test

 exponents were calculated on the dominant side for the upper body and the right side for the lower body . 
 independent t - tests showed significant differences between males and females in all strength measures , and therefore these data were analyzed separately . 
 overall , both male and female participants were symmetrical , with no significant difference in mean force production between dominant and nondominant arms , left and right leg flexors , and left and right leg extensors . in the lower limbs , extensor strength ( male mean right leg : 1822.4n    454.6n ; female mean right leg : 1193.5n    302.1n ) was approximately 5 times greater than flexor strength ( male mean right leg : 352.9n    78.3n , female mean right leg : 237.4n    53.6n ) . 
 descriptive statistics for body mass and strength measure the results of analyses for test  retest reliability are presented in table 3 . 
 the mean difference between the test and retest was consistently low for all tests  absolute difference range was 3.7 to 51.0  n , a relative difference of 0.2% to 7.3% . 
 retest reliability of novel strength measures ( n  =  17 ) pearson correlations showing the relationships between individual strength tests and body mass are presented in table 4 for males , females , and the total sample . 
 correlations were moderate and significant for 6 of the 7 tests in males ( r  =  0.430.61 , p  =  0.000 ) and 2 of the 7 tests in females ( r  =  0.300.33 , p  =  0.0140.03 ) . 
 pearson correlations and allometric scaling for body mass and strength measures allometric exponents were calculated separately for males and females ; exponents were higher for males ( range  =  0.581.27 ) than for females ( range  =  0.060.67 ) . 
 currently , the method of strength assessment used in paralympic athletics classification is based on mmt , an ordinal - scale measure . 
 this is problematic because ordinal - scale measures do not permit quantitative evaluation of the impact of impairment on athletic performance , a fundamental requirement for the development of evidence - based methods of classification . 
 the results from this study indicate that the ratio - scale strength assessment battery described could be validly applied to address this important methodological shortcoming and facilitate the development of evidence - based methods of classification . 
 in addition to furnishing a ratio - scale measure of strength , the battery has a number of features that would be advantageous for paralympic classification , including the measures are isometric and therefore training resistant ; the battery is both comprehensive ( assessing resultant forces produced by the muscle groups of principal importance in paralympic athletics ) and parsimonious ; and reliability is good to excellent . 
 furthermore , the sex - specific normal performance ranges that are reported will permit meaningful interpretation of results in athletes with impairments in future studies . 
 the key advantages of the battery evaluated in this study are expanded in the following paragraphs . 
 the following example illustrates why ratio - scale measurement is of fundamental importance to the development of evidence - based methods of classification . in wheelchair racing 
 , the current class t51 is based on the strength impairment profile of a person with a complete spinal cord injury at neurological level c56 , including impaired shoulder flexion strength ( up to grade 4 ) and triceps strength grade 03 . 
 the current class t52 profile is based on the strength impairment profile of a person with complete spinal cord injury at neurological level c78 , including normal shoulder flexion and triceps strength ( ie , grade 5 ) . if an athlete with polio presents with normal shoulder flexion strength but grade 3 triceps , the classifier must decide whether the athlete is best in class t51 ( even though they will have more shoulder flexion strength than other athletes in that class ) or in class t52 ( even though they will have less triceps strength than other athletes in class ) . in this 
 instance , decision - making should be based on evidence regarding the relative importance of shoulder flexion and triceps extension to wheelchair propulsion . 
 current , ordinal - scale methods of strength assessment are not suitable for investigating this question . 
 two additional advantages conferred by the proposed test battery are that it is both parsimonious and comprehensive . 
 these advantages occur because , rather than assessing individual muscle actions acting over a single joint , a number of the proposed tests assess the resultant force of a number of key muscle groups acting over more than one joint . 
 for example , the leg extension test assesses the combined strength of hip and knee extensors simultaneously , while the single supported arm push assesses shoulder horizontal flexion and elbow extension simultaneously . 
 consequently , the test battery described in this study comprises 7 tests , rather than the 20 individual muscle grade tests required to assess the same muscle groups in the current system . 
 in addition to saving time , the proposed test battery would considerably reduce the number of maximum contractions required from each athlete during classification , helping to ensure that fatigue did not the confound outcomes . 
 importantly , the significantly reduced number of tests does not result in a less comprehensive battery  all the principal muscle actions required for the activities that are central in paralympic athletics are evaluated ( ie , wheelchair racing , running , jumping , and throws  both standing and seated ) . more specifically , the tests capture muscle synergies that are required for performance of the activities of interest . 
 for example , the push pull test for the upper body uses the same prime movers as used for seated throwing with a pole : shoulder extension and elbow flexion of the nonthrowing arm simultaneously assessed at the same time as shoulder flexion and elbow extension on the throwing or dominant arm . the sex - specific isometric strength ranges reported in this paper on nondisabled individuals will allow the interpretation of results obtained from athletes with impairments . 
 in general , the overall pattern of results was consistent with what is known about strength  males were significantly stronger than females on all strength tests ; the lower body was stronger than the upper body and the lower limb extensor strength was greater than the flexor strength . 
 more specifically , grip strength means ( males  =  526  n ; females  =  344  n ) were comparable with means previously reported for this protocol ( males  =  523  n ; females  =  319  n ) and the mean bilateral supported arm push for males ( n ) was similar to that reported by hortobagyi ( 9976  n ) for a similar protocol performed in supine . 
 however , the battery also extends what is known about the relative strength of different movements  for example , combined hip and knee flexion was only 19.4% of extension in males and 19.9% in females . 
 these percentages are considerably less than those reported in studies of isolated lower limb movements , which indicate that knee flexion strength is between 43% and 90% of knee extension strength . 
 one final feature of the test battery described in this study which is important for the purposes of classification is that the reliability of all strength tests was excellent ( icc  >  0.8 ) for all but one test . 
 the icc for the leg flexor test was good with an icc of 0.71 , which is acceptable given the low sem ( 314  n ) and the small mean difference between test one and test 2 ( 66  n ) . as mentioned in the introduction , one advantage that current methods of strength assessment have 
 this is an important feature because classification aims to control for the impact of strength impairment on athletic performance without controlling for other advantages conferred by body size . 
 for example , 2 throwers with complete spinal cord injuries at t2 should compete in the same class for the discus , regardless of whether one is 2  m tall and weighs 100  kg and the other is 1.5  m tall and 65  kg 
 . it will be important that any new measure of strength used for the purposes of classification is , as far as possible , independent of body size . 
 results from this study indicate that a number of measures1 in males ( leg flexor strength ) and 5 measures in females ( single supported arm push , bilateral supported arm push , unsupported push pull , leg flexor and plantar flexor strength)were not strongly or significantly related to body mass . 
 this indicates that it is likely that these measures are sufficiently independent of body size to be validly applied in classification . 
 however , 6 tests in males were moderately and significantly related to body mass ( r  =  0.430.61 ) and 2 tests in females showed a weaker but still significant relationship ( 0.300.33 ) . 
 allometric exponents were also calculated to give an indication of the slope of the regression line as this would indicate how much change in strength would be expected for a given change in body mass . 
 the allometric exponents that were calculated were much larger for males ( mean of 1.06 ) than for females ( mean of 0.3 ) . 
 this indicates that a given change in body size is associated with a larger change in strength in males than in females . 
 it has been suggested by previous research that this may be due to a decrease in range of strength scores seen when males and females are analyzed separately , or a result of higher relative percentages of lean body mass in males when compared with females . 
 these results indicate that further research is required to determine whether raw measures require normalization in order to be validly applied in classification . 
 unfortunately the scaling exponents developed in this study on nondisabled participants based on body mass will not be able to be applied directly to athletes with disabilities . 
 body measurements such as body mass , height , or limb circumference are inappropriate in athletes with disabilities as neuromusculoskeletal impairment changes the relationship between these measures of body size and strength in ways that are unpredictable . 
 this is because impairments to the central and peripheral nervous system and to the muscle fiber itself , which commonly affect paralympic athletes , will disrupt the fundamental premise for scaling  that force is primarily determined by muscle cross - sectional area . for example , people affected by spastic paraplegia resulting from umn injury will retain muscle bulk better than those affected by lower motor neuron injuries due to the presence of intact spinal - level reflexes , although the impairment of structures may result in comparable impairments of strength function . 
 it is posited that local bony dimensions  for example , humerus length or biacromial width  may be the most appropriate type of anthropometric measure by which to scale strength measures in athletes with neuromusculoskeletal impairment because , compared to body mass or muscle cross - sectional area , they more commonly remain unaffected by neuromusculoskeletal impairments . 
 research is required that identifies the most appropriate local bony dimensions by which to scale   and subsequently evaluates whether normalized or raw scores are more valid for classification purposes . 
 ordinal - scale strength assessment methods are currently used in paralympic athletics classification , preventing the development of evidence - based classification systems . 
 the results from this study indicate that the ratio - scale strength assessment battery described could be validly applied to address this important methodological shortcoming and facilitate the development of evidence - based methods of classification by allowing a valid and reliable assessment of muscle strength in athletes with neuromusculoskeletal impairments . 
 the battery has a number of other features that are advantageous for classification , including the measures are isometric and therefore training resistant ; the battery is both comprehensive ( assessing resultant forces produced by the key muscle groups ) and parsimonious ; and reliability is good to excellent . 
 furthermore , the sex - specific normal performance ranges that are reported will permit meaningful interpretation of results in athletes with impairments in future studies .

 heart failure ( hf ) can result from cardiac overload or injury as well as from a complex interplay of genetic , neurohormonal , and inflammatory factors . 
 hf is classified as being associated with a reduced ejection fraction ( hfref ) or with a normal ejection fraction ( hfnef ) . 
 the percentages of patients and the mortality rates are similar in patients with hfref and hfnef . 
 the likelihood of survival is higher in patients with hfref than in those with hfnef , and the survival rate in hfnef has not significantly improved in recent years . 
 various biomarkers , including those for inflammation and neurohormones , provide important information about the pathogenesis , risk stratification , and diagnosis of hf and are used to monitor response to therapy . 
 inflammatory markers are closely associated with pathogenesis , poor functional state , and adverse prognosis in patients with hf . 
 pentraxin 3 ( ptx3 ) is a newly identified member of the pentraxin superfamily , which includes creactive protein ( crp ) and serum amyloid p. in contrast to crp , which is produced by the liver , ptx3 is produced by various cell types in various tissues , especially in the vasculature , in response to inflammatory stimuli . 
 ptx3 may reflect local inflammatory status in tissues and thus may be a new biomarker of inflammation . 
 we recently demonstrated that plasma levels of ptx3 , but not highsensitivity crp ( hscrp ) , were significantly higher in patients with hfnef than in nonhf patients . 
 in addition , these elevated levels of ptx3 were significantly and independently correlated with the presence of hfnef in patients with normal left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) . 
 other studies have also shown that ptx3 is a predictor of adverse clinical outcome in patients with hfref . 
 although much attention has been focused on hfref , less is known regarding factors that correlate with clinical outcome in patients with hfnef . 
 the irbesartan in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction ( ipreserve ) study demonstrated that age , presence of diabetes mellitus , history of hospitalization for hf , new york heart association classification , nterminal probtype natriuretic peptide levels , and lvef were associated with adverse outcomes in patients with hfnef . 
 this study was designed to determine the ability of plasma ptx3 levels to predict future cardiovascular events in patients with hfnef . 
 we initially screened 747 chronic hf patients under a clinically stable condition with new york heart association functional class ii to iv who were referred to kumamoto university hospital , kumamoto , japan . 
 none of the patients had any noncardiac causes of hflike symptoms , especially lung disease ( eg , chronic obstructive lung disease ) . 
 the diagnosis of hfnef was based on the criteria formulated by the european working group on hfnef . 
 hfref was defined as reduced systolic left ventricular ( lv ) function ( lvef50% ) . 
 hfnef was defined as normal or mildly abnormal systolic lv function ( lvef>50% ) with lv diastolic dysfunction . 
 lv diastolic dysfunction for hfnef was defined as ( 1 ) a ratio of mitral early diastolic peak flow velocity to tissue doppler early mitral annular diastolic velocity ( e / e ) 15 ; ( 2 ) e / e 8 and < 15 and btype natriuretic peptide ( bnp ) levels > 200 pg / ml ; or ( 3 ) e / e 8 and < 15 and lv mass index ( lvmi ) 122 g / m ( females ) or 149 g / m ( males ) . 
 patients were excluded if they had active systemic inflammatory disease , chronic renal failure requiring hemodialysis , collagen disease , presence of malignancy , or acute coronary syndrome within 3 months preceding enrollment . 
 the study complied with the declaration of helsinki regarding investigation in humans and was approved by the institutional review committee of each institution . 
 the study was also conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the ethics committee of our institution . 
 this study was registered at the university hospital medical information network clinical trials registry with the identification number umin000002170 .

 ptx3 levels were measured using a highsensitivity enzymelinked immunosorbent assay system ( values ranged from 0.1 to 20 ng / ml ; perseus proteomics ) . 
 other factors that were measured included serum hscrp levels and plasma tumor necrosis factor , interleukin6 , and bnp levels . 
 echocardiography was performed in standard parasternal and apical views by a specialized echocardiologist using commercially available ultrasound systems ( vivid 7 , gevingmed ultrasound ; aplio xg , toshiba ) . 
 lvef was measured in biplane apical ( 2 and 4chamber ) views using a modification of simpson 's method . 
 the e / e ratio is used as an index of lv filling pressure and abnormal lv relaxation . to assess lv diastolic function 
 , e / e was measured , as described previously , as was the medial annulus of e / e. lv mass was calculated , as described previously , and the lvmi was expressed relative to body surface area . 
 patients with hfnef were followed prospectively at the outpatient clinic until december 2012 or until an endpoint occurred . 
 the endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular death , nonfatal mi , unstable angina pectoris , nonfatal ischemic stroke , hospitalization for hf decompensation , or coronary revascularization . 
 cardiovascular events were ascertained from a review of medical records and confirmed by direct contact with the patients , their families , and physicians . 
 patients were divided into low and highptx3 groups based on the median concentration of ptx3 ( 3.0 ng / ml ) . 
 cardiovascular death was defined as death because of mi ( within 28 days ) , congestive heart failure , or documented sudden death without apparent noncardiovascular causes . 
 mi was diagnosed as a rise or fall in cardiac biomarkers ( plasma creatine kinasemb or cardiac troponint ) greater than the 99th percentile of the upper limit of normal , together with evidence of myocardial ischemia with at least one of the following : ecg changes ( recent stt changes , left bundle branch block , or a pathological q wave ) or imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality . 
 unstable angina pectoris was diagnosed from new or accelerating symptoms of myocardial ischemia accompanied by recent ischemic sttwave changes . 
 ischemic stroke was diagnosed by both neurological symptoms and radiological evidence , excluding intracranial hemorrhage . 
 hospitalization for hf decompensation was defined as admission for symptoms typical of hf with objective signs of worsening hf requiring intravenous drug administration . 
 coronary revascularization was defined as coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with stable angina pectoris . for subjects experiencing 2 or more cardiovascular events , 
 parameters with a normal distribution , as assessed by the shapirowilk test , are expressed as meansd . 
 parameters with a skewed distribution , such as ptx3 , hscrp , tumor necrosis factor , interleukin6 , and bnp levels , as well as e / e and lvmi , are shown as median values ( interquartile range ) and were logarithmically transformed before linear regression analysis . 
 differences between continuous variables were analyzed by the unpaired t test and the mannwhitney u test , as appropriate . 
 linear regression analysis was used to determine the associations between ptx3 and bnp levels , lvmi , inflammatory makers , and cardiovascular events . 
 survival data were analyzed by the kaplanmeier method and assessed by the logrank test . age and 
 the ability of any marker to predict cardiovascular events was assessed by cox proportional hazards regression analysis . in cox proportional hazards regression analyses , associations between groups and all other parameters 
 were first analyzed by univariate analysis followed by multivariable analysis after adjustment for factors that were significant with univariate analysis . 
 model 1 incorporated the inflammatory makers ptx3 , hscrp , tumor necrosis factor , interleukin6 , and bnp . 
 model 2 incorporated the 5 prognostic factors ( pf5 ) that were identified during the ipreserve study in patients with hfnef  age , presence of diabetes mellitus , previous hospitalization for hf , new york heart association classification , and lvef  as well as bnp and ptx3 . 
 model 4 incorporated pf5 , bnp , hscrp , and ptx3 . estimates of the cstatistic for cox proportional hazards regression models were calculated . 
 calibration of cox regression models was also performed by the grnnesby and borgan calibration test . 
 the incremental effects of addition of ptx3 to pf5 and bnp levels to predict future cardiovascular events were evaluated using the net classification index ( nri ) , as previously described . 
 patients were stratified into 1 of 3 risk categories based on pf5 and bnp levels measured during the mean 30month followup period : low risk ( 0% to < 10% ) , intermediate risk ( 10% to 20% ) , or high risk ( > 20% ) . 
 ptx3 was subsequently used to reclassify the risk category for ascertaining whether there would be improvement in the nri . 
 the nri was calculated using the following equation : nri=([number of events reclassified as highernumber of events reclassified as lower]/number of events)([number of nonevents reclassified as lowernumber of nonevents reclassified as higher]/number of nonevents ) . 
 all analyses were performed using spss version 19.0j for windows ( ibm corporation ) , stata version 11 ( stata corporation ) , and sas version 9.1.3 ( sas institute inc ) .

 the results of univariate and multivariable cox proportional hazards analyses for cardiovascular events are shown in tables 3 and 4 . 
 multivariable cox proportional hazards analysis identified ptx3 ( hazard ratio [ hr ] : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.05 to 1.27 ; p<0.01 ) , highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol ( hr : 0.99 ; 95% ci : 0.97 to 0.99 ; p<0.05 ) , lvmi ( hr : 1.03 ; 95% ci : 1.05 to 1.27 ) , and bnp ( hr : 1.08 ; 95% ci : 1.03 to 1.14 ; p<0.001 ) as predictors of future cardiovascular events after adjustment for significant factors that were identified by univariate analysis ( table 3 ) . using the forced inclusion model , which evaluated levels of inflammatory markers and bnp ( model 1 ) in multivariable cox hazards analysis , ptx3 , but not hscrp , significantly predicted cardiovascular events ( hr : 1.17 ; 95% ci : 1.07 to 1.28 ; p<0.001 ) . in the forced inclusion model , which included pf5 and bnp , ptx3 significantly predicted cardiovascular events ( model 2 : hr : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.05 to 1.27 ; p<0.01 ; model 4 : hr : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.06 to 1.27 ; p<0.01 ) ( table 4 ) . furthermore , multivariable cox proportional hazards analysis identified ptx3 ( hr : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.01 to 1.35 ; p<0.05 ) and bnp ( hr : 1.21 ; 95% ci : 1.11 to 1.31 ; p<0.001 ) as predictors of future hfrelated cardiovascular events , including cardiovascular death and hospitalization for hf decompensation , after adjustment for significant factors identified by univariate analysis . 
 we classified patients with hfnef into 4 groups according to the levels of ln(ptx3 ) : first quartile ( < 0.59 , ptx3 : < 1.80 ng / ml ) , second quartile ( 0.59 to 1.10 , ptx3 : 1.80 to 3.00 ng / ml ) , third quartile ( 1.10 to 1.35 , ptx3 : 3.00 to 3.85 ng / ml ) , and fourth quartile ( > 1.35 , ptx3 : > 3.85 ng / ml ) ; the relative risk of total cardiovascular events was 1 ( reference ) , 1.36 , 2.71 ( p<0.001 versus the reference ) , and 3.17 ( p<0.001 versus the reference ) , respectively . 
 the logtransformation values of ptx3 demonstrated a linear association with the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with hfnef ( r=0.965 , p=0.03 ) .

 to the best of our knowledge , this report is the first to show a significant association between plasma levels of ptx3 , a marker of inflammation , and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hfnef . 
 the addition of high ptx3 levels to the pf5 and bnp levels , which were previously found to be prognostic in patients with hfnef , improved their risk stratification , as indicated by a substantial increase in the cstatistics and significance of nri . 
 activation of the inflammatory process is important in the pathogenesis of hf and in adverse prognosis of patients with this condition . 
 several studies have investigated the role of inflammation as a therapeutic target , although initial trials had limited success . 
 consequently , specific antiinflammatory approaches for the different types and stages of hf ( ie , hfnef and hfref ) remain a priority , as does a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying hfrelated inflammation . 
 the established inflammatory marker hscrp is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with hf . 
 elevated crp levels predict hospitalization of hf patients , although the association between crp and hf events is no longer significant after adjustment for the presence of lv diastolic dysfunction . 
 consequently , the relationships between inflammatory markers and the prognosis of patients with hfnef remain unclear . 
 , remodeling is driven by the loss of cardiomyocytes , whereas in hfnef , a systemic inflammatory state induces oxidative stress in the coronary microvascular endothelium , which drives myocardial dysfunction and remodeling . 
 other studies have shown that serum levels of inflammatory cytokines are high in patients with hfnef and that interleukin16 , a cytokine considered an important mediator in inflammation , promotes cardiac fibrosis and myocardial stiffening in hfnef . consequently , investigating the relationships between inflammatory markers and prognosis in hfnef is important . 
 we observed a significant correlation between plasma levels of ptx3 , a novel inflammatory maker , and future cardiovascular events in patients with hfnef . 
 furthermore , considerable evidence suggests that ptx3 may better reflect local inflammatory status in tissues than does liverderived crp . 
 we previously reported that ptx3 was partly produced in the coronary circulation in patients with hfnef . 
 these results suggest that ptx3 , rather than crp , reflects vascular and cardiac inflammation in patients with hfnef and might be a cardiovascular biomarker for the assessment and management of hf . in the present study , we showed that increased inflammation as assessed by ptx3 measurement was significantly associated with poor prognosis for hfnef patients by multivariable cox hazards analysis . 
 ptx3 as an inflammation maker and bnp as a myocardial stress marker  to the previously established prognostic factors in the ipreserve study of hfnef patients improved their risk stratification performance , as indicated by an increase in the cstatistics . 
 these results suggest the possible relative merits of these 2 biomarkers for future risk management in hfnef . in nri analyses , 
 the addition of ptx3 was able to provide a more appropriate risk assessment in patients who were evaluated as having a high risk state by previously described hfnef prognostic factors ( pf5 plus bnp ) in patients without cardiovascular events . 
 furthermore , the addition of ptx3 never resulted in a worse risk classification in patients with cardiovascular events . 
 consequently , the significance of nri was shown by incorporating ptx3 into the new riskassessment model . 
 the site of ptx3 production in patients with hfnef remains unclear . under normal physiological conditions , 
 ptx3 is expressed in atherosclerotic lesions , adipose tissue , and the heart with acute and subacutephase hf ; however , the types of cells that express ptx3 in failing hearts of patients with hfnef and chronic hf have not been determined . 
 accumulation of the extracellular matrix ( ie , fibrosis ) may also be pathophysiologically important in progression of the hfnef disease process and be a contributor to subsequent events . 
 hfnef may also be caused by structural and molecular abnormalities of the cardiovascular system , including cardiac and noncardiac factors , such as those associated with vascular functions . 
 we recently demonstrated significant involvement of endothelial dysfunction in the prognosis of patients with hfnef , suggesting that improvement in endothelial function could be a potential therapeutic target in patients with hfnef . 
 ptx3 is produced by fibrous tissues and endothelial cells in response to inflammatory stimuli and is considered an important marker of vascular pathology . in patients with acute mi and infectious myocarditis , 
 ptx3 is produced by macrophages , endothelial cells , and , to a lesser extent , myocardiocytes and is localized in the interstitium . 
 the interstitial localization of ptx3 in human failing hearts suggests that ptx3 is produced locally by fibroblasts in the cardiac interstitium . 
 consequently , in patients with hfnef , ptx3 might be produced by myocardial fibroblasts and/or endothelial cells rather than in subclinical atherosclerotic lesions in patients with hfnef . 
 we found that the frequency of hfrelated cardiovascular events , including cardiovascular death and hospitalization for hf decompensation , was significantly higher in patients with high ptx3 levels than in those with low ptx3 levels . 
 this finding suggests that ptx3 is more predictive of future hfrelated cardiovascular events than of vascular events in patients with hfnef . 
 we used the median value of ptx3 ( 3.0 ng / ml ) as the cutoff point in the present study . 
 suzuki et al demonstrated that the median value of ptx3 was 3.7 ng / ml in patients with hfref and split the patients into 2 groups : those above and those below 4.0 ng / ml . in this study , patients with hfref were targeted , and it has already been demonstrated that patients with hfref have higher inflammatory activity than those with hfnef . 
 we previously demonstrated that the 75% range value of ptx3 was 2.90 ng / ml in nonhf patients with risk factors ( hypertension , 67.8% ; diabetes mellitus , 37.4% ; dyslipidemia , 57.1% ; and coronary artery disease , 55.0% ) . 
 furthermore , inoue et al showed that ptx3 levels were < 2.28 ng / ml in healthy volunteers . in previous studies of cardiovascular events in stable patients with coronary risk factors , 
 thus , we consider that the median value of 3.0 ng / ml for ptx3 was a clinically meaningful cutoff point in our study . 
 first , our study included only a relatively small number of patients in a single center . 
 second , the population of this study was relatively young and predominantly male ; had a low prevalence of atrial fibrillation , a higher frequency of mild hf , relatively lower bnp levels ; and had less frequent use of diuretics . because our institution is an educational hospital and the design was a singlecenter study in japan , the recruited patients with hfnef might have had differences in characteristics compared with those in western studies . consequently , a large , multiracial , multicenter study is required to confirm our results . 
 recent studies in mouse models have shown that ptx3 has a cardioprotective effect , suggesting that ptx3 might protect the cardiovascular system by modulating the immune  inflammatory balance . 
 further in vivo and in vitro experiments are required to determine the exact role of high ptx3 levels in hfnef . despite these limitations , 
 a largescale multicenter trial is warranted to further examine the pathological role and clinical significance of ptx3 in hfnef . 
 high plasma ptx3 levels , but not other inflammatory markers including hscrp , are significantly correlated with future cardiovascular events in patients with hfnef .

high plasma ptx levels inflammatory markers including hscrp significantly correlated future cardiovascular events patients hfnef","backgroundpentraxin 3 ( ptx3 ) is a novel inflammatory marker produced by various cell types including those of the vasculature and the heart . 
 the relationship between inflammatory markers and prognosis of patients with heart failure with normal ejection fraction ( hfnef ) remains unknown . 
 we investigated whether plasma ptx3 levels can predict future cardiovascular events in patients with hfnef.methods and resultsplasma ptx3 , highsensitivity creactive protein , and btype natriuretic peptide levels were measured prospectively in 360 stable patients with hfnef . 
 the subsequent incidence of cardiovascular events , including cardiovascular death , nonfatal myocardial infarction ( mi ) , unstable angina pectoris , nonfatal ischemic stroke , hospitalization for heart failure decompensation , and coronary revascularization , was determined . during a mean 30month followup , 
 106 patients experienced cardiovascular events . 
 these events were more frequent in patients with high plasma ptx3 levels ( > 3.0 ng / ml ) than low levels ( 3.0 ng / ml ) . 
 multivariable cox hazard analysis showed that ptx3 ( hazard ratio : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.05 to 1.27 ; p<0.01 ) and btype natriuretic peptide ( hazard ratio : 1.08 ; 95% ci : 1.03 to 1.14 ; p<0.001 ) , but not highsensitivity creactive protein levels , were significant predictors of future cardiovascular events . 
 multivariable cox analysis with the forced inclusion model , including 5 previously identified prognostic factors , found that ptx3 was a significant predictor of cardiovascular events ( hazard ratio : 1.16 ; 95% ci : 1.06 to 1.27 ; p<0.01 ) . 
 the cstatistics for cardiovascular events substantially increased from 0.617 to 0.683 when ptx3 was added to the 5 previously identified prognostic factors.conclusionshigh plasma ptx3 levels , but not other inflammatory markers , are correlated with future cardiovascular events in patients with hfnef . 
 ptx3 may be a useful biomarker for assessment of risk stratification in hfnef.clinical trial registrationurl : http://www.umin.ac.jp ; unique identifier : umin000002170 ."
"subjects with chronic insomnia have a higher risk for hypertension [ 13 ] and u - shaped associations have also been demonstrated between sleep duration and hypertension . 
 studies have reported that insomnia is associated with an overall hypersecretion of acth and cortisol , suggesting an activation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis in these patients [ 58 ] . 
 given the well - established association of hypercortisolemia with significant medical morbidity ( eg , hypertension , metabolic syndrome , osteoporosis ) , insomnia can induce hypertension through an activation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis . on the other hand 
 , it has also be confirmed that subjects with hypertension are more likely to report emotional disorders such as anxiety , depression , and sleep disorders , which are usually viewed as one of their clinical features , indicating that hypertension is a risk factor for sleep disorders . 
 it is well known that both sleep quality and hypertension are strongly influenced by lifestyle . 
 it has been confirmed that there is a u - shaped association between alcohol consumption and hypertension or chronic insomnia . 
 insomnia is a risk factor for hypertension [ 13 ] , and individuals with hypertension are more likely to have sleep disorders . 
 some behaviors ( eg , exercise , smoking , alcohol consumption ) are risk factors for both sleep disorders and hypertension [ 1315 ] , sleep disorders and hypertension are both risk factors for mortality in the elderly [ 4,1619 ] , and hypertension and sleep disorders are both related to age . from all of these , we can conclude that in very elderly subjects ( aged 90 years or more ) , there is a close association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure , which may be different from that in he general population of older adults ( aged 60 years or more ) . 
 however , to our knowledge , no population - based study has evaluated the association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure in the very elderly . in this study 
 we examined the association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure in the very elderly subjects using data from a sample of chinese nonagenarians and centenarians , 
 the methods were reported previously . in brief , on the basis of the dujiangyan ( located in sichuan province , southwest china ) 2005 census , a cross - sectional study for age - related diseases was conducted in 870 very elderly subjects ( > 90 years ) , which was a part of the project of longevity and aging in dujiangyan ( plad ) . 
 the plad aimed to investigate the relationship between environments , lifestyle , genetics , longevity and age - related diseases . 
 volunteers were examined by trained professional physicians according to basic health criteria and the results were entered into standard forms , especially the questionnaire on lifestyles ( including the pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi ) ) . in this analysis , subjects were excluded who were using medicine for treating sleep problems of hypertension , were bedridden , had cancer , a history or clinical evidence of stroke , secondary hypertension , or were receiving anti - hypertensive treatment , had terminal stage of physical disease such as respiratory system disease , cardiovascular disease , kidney disease , dementia or cognitive decline . 
 overall , 21 men and 26 women were not eligible for the study because they had already died or moved away from the area . 
 of the 262 men and 561 women who were interviewed , 46 men and 117 women were excluded for the reasons above . 
 informed consents were obtained from all participants ( as well as their legal proxies ) . 
 the research ethics committee of the sichuan university approved the study . to assure reliability of this information , during the course of interviewing , at least 1 family member , who usually lived with the participant , took part in the interviewing and checked the completed questionnaire for accuracy . 
 the methods were reported previously . sitting or recumbent position , right arm blood pressure ( bp ) 
 was measured twice to the nearest 2 mmhg using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer ( phases i and v of korotkoff ) by trained nurses or physicians . 
 the mean value of 2 measurements was used to calculate systolic bp ( sbp ) and diastolic bp ( dbp ) , and the sbp and dbp were calculated as the mean of right and left arm values in exceptional subjects . 
 the mean of 2 readings was used for classification of bp according to joint national committee ( jnc)vii criteria into normal ( sbp < 120mmhg and dbp < 80mmhg ) , pre - hypertension ( sbp 120139 mmhg and/or dbp 8089 mmhg ) , stage 1 hypertension ( sbp 140159 mmhg and/or dbp 9099 mmhg ) , stage 2 hypertension ( sbp > 160 mmhg and/or dbp > 100 mmhg ) , systolic hypertension was defined as a sbp > 140 mmhg , the isolated systolic hypertension ( ish ) was defined as a sbp > 140 mmhg and a dbp<90mmhg , diastolic hypertension was defined as a dbp > 90 mmhg , and the isolated diastolic hypertension ( idh ) was defined as a sbp < 140 mmhg and a dbp > 90 mmhg . 
 hypertension was defined as a sbp > 140 mmhg and/or a dbp > 90 mmhg and/or receiving anti - hypertensive treatment . 
 subjects with confirmed hypertension and no identified cause of secondary hypertension were diagnosed with essential hypertension . the pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi ) 
 the psqi is a questionnaire consisting of 19 items which are coded on a 4-point scale ( 03 ) to obtain 7 subcategories : sleep duration , sleep disturbances , sleep latency , daytime dysfunction , sleep efficiency , sleep satisfaction , and medication use . 
 the sum of all subscores represents the total sleep quality score , ranging between 021 , with higher scores representing lower sleep quality . 
 the individuals were categorized as follows : good sleep quality ( scores between 0 and 5 ) ; fairly good sleep quality ( scores between 6 and 10 ) ; and poor sleep quality ( scores between 11 and 21 ) . 
 psychometric properties have demonstrated good reliability ( internal consistency : 0.89 ; test retest reliability : 0.85 ) and good construct validity for the english language version . 
 the psqi is a widely used tool in research studies and clinical trials , and has been translated into several languages including chinese , spanish , german , and hebrew , with comparable reliability and validity values . internal consistency in the present study was =0.69 . when excluding the medication use subscale due to a low rate of medication users in this sample , internal consistency increased to =0.76 . 
 outcome measures included the total psqi score as well as self - report of sleep latency ( sl ) ( question 2 :  how long ( in minutes ) has it usually taken you to fall asleep each night ?  ) , and sleep efficiency percentage ( se ) , computed as the ratio between the hours of actual sleep ( question 4 :  how many hours of actual sleep did you get at night ?  ) and total time in bed ( hours computed based on reported bedtime in question 1 :  what time have you usually gone to bed at night ?  and reported wake - time in question 3 :  what time have you usually gotten up in the morning ?  ) , multiplied by 100 . 
 the baseline examination included information on age ( years ) , sex ( male / female ) , smoking habits ( yes or no ) , alcohol consumption ( yes or no ) , tea consumption ( yes or no ) , exercise ( yes or no ) , serum lipid / lipoprotein levels ( including serum triglyceride ( tg ) , total cholesterol ( tc ) , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol , and low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol ) , fasting blood glucose ( fbg ) , serum uric acid ( sua ) , and body mass index ( bmi ) . 
 the bmi was calculated as body weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared . 
 serum lipid / lipoprotein levels , fbg and sua were determined by standard laboratory techniques ( performed by a technician in the biochemistry laboratory of sichuan university ) . 
 behaviors of smoking , alcohol consumption , tea consumption , and exercise , which included former and current status , were collected by using a general questionnaire . in the questionnaire , 
 subjects were asked whether they had ever had behaviors of smoking , alcohol consumption , tea consumption , and exercise , and 1 of 3 answers were recorded : never , did in the past , or currently . among those who did , currently or in the past 
 , information was obtained on the average frequency of smoking , using alcohol , drinking tea , and doing exercise , and on the number of years they had engaged in the behavior . 
 the subjects , who did almost everyday during the past year , were classified as those with these habits current , otherwise as without . 
 the subjects , who had done behaviors almost everyday for more than 2 years as of a year before , were classified as those with these habits previously , otherwise as without . 
 alcohol consumption included spirits , liqueurs , wine , sherry , martini , beer , lager , hard cider , stout , and so on . 
 all of the statistical analyses for this study were performed with the spss for windows software package , version11.5 ( spss inc , chicago , illinois , usa ) . 
 baseline characteristics were compared between subjects with and without hypertension , between subjects with and without systolic hypertension , between subjects with and without diastolic hypertension using pearson chi - square or fisher s exact test ( where an expected cell count was < 5 ) for categorical variables and unpaired student s t test for continuous variables . 
 baseline characteristics were also compared among different sleep quality groups using one - way for analysis of variance ( anova ) for continuous variables and pearson chi - square or fisher s exact test ( where an expected cell count was < 5 ) for categorical variables . 
 multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio ( or ) and 95% confidence interval ( ci ) of sleep quality as a function of increased risk for hypertension , systolic hypertension or diastolic hypertension . 
 the following items were adjusted : age , sex , serum lipid / lipoprotein , body mass index , blood glucose level , smoking , alcohol consumption , tea consumption , and exercise . a p value < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant , and all of the p values were 2-sided . 
 the methods were reported previously . in brief , on the basis of the dujiangyan ( located in sichuan province , southwest china ) 2005 census , a cross - sectional study for age - related diseases was conducted in 870 very elderly subjects ( > 90 years ) , which was a part of the project of longevity and aging in dujiangyan ( plad ) . 
 the plad aimed to investigate the relationship between environments , lifestyle , genetics , longevity and age - related diseases . 
 volunteers were examined by trained professional physicians according to basic health criteria and the results were entered into standard forms , especially the questionnaire on lifestyles ( including the pittsburgh sleep quality index ( psqi ) ) . in this analysis , subjects were excluded who were using medicine for treating sleep problems of hypertension , were bedridden , had cancer , a history or clinical evidence of stroke , secondary hypertension , or were receiving anti - hypertensive treatment , had terminal stage of physical disease such as respiratory system disease , cardiovascular disease , kidney disease , dementia or cognitive decline . 
 overall , 21 men and 26 women were not eligible for the study because they had already died or moved away from the area . 
 of the 262 men and 561 women who were interviewed , 46 men and 117 women were excluded for the reasons above . 
 informed consents were obtained from all participants ( as well as their legal proxies ) . 
 the research ethics committee of the sichuan university approved the study . to assure reliability of this information , during the course of interviewing , at least 1 family member , who usually lived with the participant , took part in the interviewing and checked the completed questionnaire for accuracy . 
 the methods were reported previously . sitting or recumbent position , right arm blood pressure ( bp ) was measured twice to the nearest 2 mmhg using a standard mercury sphygmomanometer ( phases i and v of korotkoff ) by trained nurses or physicians . 
 the mean value of 2 measurements was used to calculate systolic bp ( sbp ) and diastolic bp ( dbp ) , and the sbp and dbp were calculated as the mean of right and left arm values in exceptional subjects . 
 the mean of 2 readings was used for classification of bp according to joint national committee ( jnc)vii criteria into normal ( sbp < 120mmhg and dbp < 80mmhg ) , pre - hypertension ( sbp 120139 mmhg and/or dbp 8089 mmhg ) , stage 1 hypertension ( sbp 140159 mmhg and/or dbp 9099 mmhg ) , stage 2 hypertension ( sbp > 160 mmhg and/or dbp > 100 mmhg ) , systolic hypertension was defined as a sbp > 140 mmhg , the isolated systolic hypertension ( ish ) was defined as a sbp > 140 mmhg and a dbp<90mmhg , diastolic hypertension was defined as a dbp > 90 mmhg , and the isolated diastolic hypertension ( idh ) was defined as a sbp < 140 mmhg and a dbp > 90 mmhg .

 all of these showed that among very elderly subjects there was no association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure . 
 this study evaluated the association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure in very elderly subjects . in the present study , 
 arterial blood pressure included systolic blood pressure , diastolic blood pressure , hypertension , systolic hypertension and diastolic hypertension . in the cross - sectional observations , there was no association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure . 
 several studies have shown that there was a strongly significant association of sleep quality with arterial blood pressure , or with the risk of hypertension among children , adolescents , and adults ( aged 60 years or younger ) . 
 however , many previous studies showed that there was no association of sleep quality with arterial blood pressure in the elderly aged 60 years or older [ 2830 ] . in the previous studies , 
 participants were all less than 90 years of age . in our study , participants were all aged 90108 years . 
 our finding provided the evidence from very elderly subjects and extended this association of sleep quality with arterial blood pressure to very elderly people . combining the results of previous studies and our finding in the present study , we should conclude here that the association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure changed with age ; that in a population aged less than 60 years it was significant , but that in a population aged more than 60 years ( including general elderly aged 60 years or older and very elderly aged 90 years or older ) it was non - significant . 
 progressive arterial stiffness , as a result of structural and functional changes within the vessel wall , is a feature of aging and may precede the onset of hypertension [ 2631 ] . 
 isolated systolic hypertension , defined as raised sbp but normal dbp , is the predominant form of hypertension in elderly people ( 65 years ) ; systolic - diastolic hypertension is not as common in this population , as dbp stabilizes or even declines with advancing age [ 26,3234 ] . in our study , 
 in very elderly chinese , there were high prevalences of hypertension ( 57.2% ) , systolic hypertension ( 55.2% ) , and isolated systolic hypertension ( 44.2% ) , and low prevalences of diastolic hypertension ( 13.0% ) , systolic - diastolic hypertension ( 11.0% ) and isolated diastolic hypertension ( 2.0% ) . 
 the prevalence of hypertension , systolic hypertension and isolated systolic hypertension in the present study was higher than that in the elderly aged 60 years or older from the previous reports , but the prevalence of diastolic hypertension , systolic - diastolic hypertension and isolated diastolic hypertension were lower than that in the elderly aged 60 years or older from the previous reports . 
 this was consistent with previous findings that with advancing age , progressive arterial stiffness results in sbp increase and dbp decline . 
 these indicate that systolic and diastolic blood pressure has different clinical significance in the elderly , especially in very elderly subjects . 
 considering this , we further independently assessed the association of systolic and diastolic blood pressure with sleep quality when the data were analyzed . 
 all the results showed that there was no association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure ( including sbp and dbp ) in very elderly subjects ; this strongly confirmed the non - significant association between sleep quality and arterial blood pressure in very elderly subjects . among children , adolescents , and general adults , 
 habitually sleep problems could lead to the development and maintenance of hypertension through elevated sympathetic nervous system activity , waking physical and psychosocial stressors , increased salt retention and changed exposure to raised 24-hour blood pressure and heart rate . 
 extended exposure to these forces could lead to the entrainment of the cardiovascular system to operate at elevated pressure equilibrium through structural adaptations such as arterial and left ventricle hypertrophic remodeling . 
 habitual sleep problems could also contribute to hypertension by disrupting circadian rhythmicity and autonomic balance . 
 dramatic alterations in these parameters in modern industrialized society are theorized to cause the environment sensed by the brain to become metabolically flattened and arrhythmic , disturbing the circadian rhythmicity of blood pressure in susceptible individuals . 
 hypertension is characterized by a disturbance in the circadian rhythmicity of many physiological variables , such as a shifting of the daily blood pressure profile to higher values , an increased prevalence of the non - dipping pattern , increased blood pressure variability , and disturbances in the diurnal rhythm of cardiac output . 
 hypertensive subjects have been shown to have reductions of > 50% in the 3 main neuronal populations of the scn in comparisons between normal subjects and hypertensive subjects who died of myocardial infarction or brain hemorrhage . 
 there was the difference between the elderly and younger adults , children or adolescents , and there was no association of sleep with hypertension in the elderly . 
 the mechanism of the difference is unclear and should be further explored , and might be related with the following . 
 firstly , there was a high mortality rate among the elderly , specifically among the every elderly , and both sleep problem and hypertension were related with high mortality rate . 
 the high mortality in the elderly more likely removed those both with sleep problem and hypertension , and left the one or the other , and removed the association between sleep problem and hypertension . secondly , degradation of arterial wall structure with age resulted in elevated arterial blood pressure , a high risk for hypertension , and insensitivity for sympathetic hormone . in the present study 
 , there was a high prevalence of hypertension ( 57.19% ) in the sample , and provide an evidence for a high prevalence of hypertension in the elderly [ 26,3134 ] . 
 activation of the sympathetic nervous system is an important mechanism that links sleep disorders with combined systolic and diastolic hypertension , which is common in middle - aged hypertensive patients . 
 however , no mechanistic link has been identified between sleep disorders and isolated systolic hypertension that results from age - dependent loss of arterial compliance and accounts for nearly 60% of hypertension in elderly populations [ 3035 ] . 
 thirdly , advanced age is associated with changes in sleep architecture , with increased difficulties in sleep initiation and maintenance . 
 elderly subjects , who are often retired , also have more opportunities to take naps during the day [ 3638 ] . 
 first , 870 subjects aged 90 years or older volunteered for the plad study , and among these 870 volunteers only 660 were included in the statistical analysis 
 . there might be selection biases . because subjects with cancer , a history or clinical evidence of stroke , terminal stage of physical disease such as of respiratory system disease , cardiovascular disease , and kidney disease , usually have symptoms which could lead to insomnia and being bedridden . 
 however , as our sample was from the community , not from hospital or nursing home , the information from them ( excluded from the sample ) might be unable to influence the practical implications of the present study . 
 second , because of the cross - sectional nature of this study , the subjects might change their diets and the conditions related to elevated hypertension and habits of sleep . 
 however , the lifestyles , habits of sleep and food habits of the nonagenarians / centenarians were relatively stable and similar . 
 third , since this was a part of the plad , there might be a survival bias . 
 finally , we did not adjust for other potential confounding factors , such as socio - economic status and family history of sleep disorders .

"dyschromatosis is a rare genodermatosis which is characterized by hyper and hypo pigmented macules of variable shape and size . 
 case one was a 30-year - old male patient who presented with asymptomatic multiple hypopigmented , and hyperpigmented skin lesions all over the body [ figure 1a and b ] since the age of 10 years . the initial lesions started in the chest and then spread to the entire body in 2 years . 
 there was no history of photosensitivity or handling of any chemical or any history of drug intake . 
 skin biopsy from the hyperpigmented macules showed the increased melanin pigmentation [ figure 2a ] , and the hypopigmented macules showed a marked decrease in the epidermal basal melanin [ figure 2b ] . 
 based on these findings , a diagnosis of dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria ( duh ) was made . 
 ( a and b ) case one with multiple hypopigmented and hyperpigmented macules all over the body photomicrograph depicting marked increase in the epidermal basal melanin from the hyperpigmented macules ( a ) and decrease in the epidermal basal melanin from the hypopigmented macules ( b ) of all the five cases ( h and e , 400 ) case two was a 22-year - old male presenting to our outpatient department with asymptomatic multiple hypo and hyperpigmented macules all over the body [ figure 3 ] since 12 years . 
 case two with multiple hypopigmented and hyperpigmented macules all over the body case three was a 14-year - old boy who presented with similar lesions all over the body [ figure 4a and b ] since the age of 2 years . 
 he also had multiple verucca vulgaris over the left arm and dorsum of hands [ figure 4c ] . 
 case three with similar reticulate pigmentation all over the body ( a and b ) ; broad nasal bridge , long philtrum ( a ) with verucca vulgaris on the dorsum of right hand ( c ) depicts case three and case four with palms showing similar mottled pigmentation case four was the 9-year - old sibling of the 14-year - old boy who revealed similar lesions all over the body [ figure 6 ] since 9 months of age . 
 he had recurrent pyodermas [ figure 6a ] since birth . on examination , he had molluscum contagiosum lesions [ figure 6b ] on the face . both the siblings also had a broad nasal bridge , long philtrum , and high arched palate . the possibility of primary immunodeficiency was kept and baseline immunodeficiency workup was done . 
 his serum immunoglobulin assay was normal and human immunodeficiency virus one and two tests ( elisa ) were negative . 
 both the brothers had hypopigmented , and hyper pigmented macules of varying sizes all over the body . 
 case four with similar reticulate pigmentation all over the body , abscess over the forehead , molluscum contagiosum ; broad nasal bridge , long philtrum based on these findings , a diagnosis of duh was made in all the four cases . 
 the other differential diagnosis in all these four cases included xeroderma pigmentosum , dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria , dyschromic amyloidosis , and disorders due to chemical exposure such as diphenylcyclopropenone , and monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone . 
 absence of photosensitivity , atrophy , telangiectasia , eye involvement and benign nature of the condition makes xeroderma pigmentosum unlikely . 
 these lesions were differentiated from dsh in which the lesions occur in a more acral distribution . 
 the disorder was also differentiated from dyschromic amyloidosis by the absence of predominant lesions in the sun exposed areas and absence of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis . 
 case five was a 21-year - old male who presented with asymptomatic multiple hypo and hyperpigmented skin lesions over the extremities [ figure 7 ] since the age of 1-year . 
 biopsy from the hypopigmented macules showed decreased melanin pigmentation whereas biopsy from the hyperpigmented macules showed increased focal melanin in the basal layer . 
 other possibilities such as duh , and reticulate acropigmentation of kitamura were included in the differentials . 
 duh was ruled out as it is characterized by more extensive lesions including the non acral / unexposed areas of the body . 
 further , the disease is differentiated from reticulate acropigmentation of kitamura by the absence of atrophic macules , palmar pits or breaks in the epidermal ridge pattern . 
 case five with similar lesions over the extremities the features of all these five cases have been summarized in table 1 . 
 reticulate pigmentary dermatoses ( rpd ) comprise a rare group of disorders , characterized by hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules coalescing to form a reticular pattern . 
 the various acral rpd includes reticulate acropigmentation of kitamura , acropigmentation of dohi , acromelanosis heterochromia extremitarium , and dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria ( dsh ) . 
 the differential diagnoses of generalized rpd are duh , dermatopathia pigmentoreticularis , naegeli - franceschetti - jadassohn syndrome , and dyskeratosis congenita ( dkc ) . 
 dyschromatosis is a spectrum of disease which includes duh , dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria ( dsh ) or acropigmentation of dohi and a segmental form called unilateral dermatomal pigmentary dermatosis . 
 duh , a rare autosomal dominant genodermatosis was first described by ichikawa and hiraga in 1933 . 
 duh is characterized by the presence of both hyperpigmented and hypopigmented , small , irregular macules distributed symmetrically all over the body . 
 these cases usually do not progress or worsen as age advances , once well established . 
 theses macules are usually smaller ( 15 mm ) , but larger macules measuring up to 15 cm have been reported . the trunk and the extremities are commonly involved . 
 the face is generally not involved , and there is sparing of the palms , soles , and mucous membranes . 
 various systemic associations including small stature and high - tone deafness , dowling - degos disease , x - linked ocular albinism , tuberous sclerosis have been described . 
 many other associated conditions have been reported , such as ocular abnormalities , photosensitivity , learning difficulties , mental retardation , epilepsy , insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus , and erythrocyte , platelet and tryptophan metabolism abnormalities . 
 duh is thought to occur secondary to the interference with the neural - melanocytic interaction in early embryonic life in those who are genetically susceptible . 
 the gene responsible for duh has been mapped to 6q24.2-q25.2 ( omim 127500 ) . because the exact biochemical basis of the gene defect is unknown , the diagnosis generally relies on the external phenotype . here 
 one case was associated with mental and growth retardation , recurrent respiratory tract infection , verucca vulgaris ; and his younger brother had recurrent pyoderma with molluscum contagiosum . 
 both the brothers had characteristic facies of high arched palate , broad nasal root , and long philtrum . 
 we also report one case of dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria in a 21-year - old male patient presenting with similar macules over the extremities . 
 patients with dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria ( reticulate acropigmentation of dohi ) present with hyperpigmented and hypopigmented macules on the face and the dorsal aspects of the extremities . 
 skin lesions remain localized on extremities in nearly half of the patients and involve face and extremities in the remaining half . 
 most cases of dsh are inherited as autosomal dominant , although an autosomal recessive variant of dhs has been reported . 
 later , novel mutations in the adra1 were reported in chinese families confirming that this gene is responsible for dsh in the different ethnic group . 
 more recently , suzuki et al . reported 16 novel mutations in the adra1 without identifying such mutations in patients with duh . 
 in a recent ultra - structural skin investigation , nuber et al . indicated that duh is a disorder of melanosome synthesis rate or melanocyte activity and not a disorder of melanocyte number . 
 dyschromatosis is a benign condition which is usually not associated with systemic involvement which has to be differentiated from conditions like xeroderma pigmentosum , dkc . 
 we report these cases because of their rare occurrence and characteristic facies of high arched palate , broad nasal root , and long philtrum ; recurrent respiratory tract infections , verucca vulgaris , molluscum contagiosum , and pyodermas as an association of duh has not been reported to the best of our knowledge .

"plant researchers took efforts to elucidate biological roles and functioning mechanisms of phytohormones in various plant responses ( 1 ) . and 
 thus , phytohormones had been revealed to mediate a whole range of developmental processes , as well as to interact with environmental factors by extensive physiological and genetic studies . to summarize the advance made on phytohormone research in recent decades , an arabidopsis hormone database ( ahd , http://ahd.cbi.pku.edu.cn ) 
 the database includes a large collection of arabidopsis hormone related genes ( ahrgs ) , which are defined as genes involving in the biosynthesis , metabolism , transport , perception or signaling pathways of eight types of phytohormones . 
 the ahd also integrates detailed gene information ( largely manually curated ) and a phenotype ontology that is developed to precisely describe myriad hormone - regulated morphological processes with standardized vocabularies in the model organism arabidopsis . 
 free and friendly interface is available for online access to the database , which benefits searching particular hormone related gene or retrieve bulk data by hormone category or specific phenotypic trait . 
 meanwhile , cross - links to ppi and kegg were also provided for molecular biochemical studies . in the past 2 years 
 many new genes have been identified to function in plant hormone production or signaling pathways . 
 for example the discovery of etp1/2 that regulate ein2 proteolysis filled the gap of ethylene signaling pathway ( 3 ) . meanwhile , 
 unequivocal evidence had been accumulated to solve some long - sought questions or clarify long - standing controversies , for instance , the recent identification of pyr / pyl / pcar proteins as authentic aba receptors ( 4 ) . besides 
 , wide - range interactions among various components lead to complicated modes of phytohormones action , thus increasing efforts using systems biology approaches have been employed in order to uncover the underlying mechanism ( 5 ) . as a result , phytohormone studies have been expanded to a much wider scope . 
 a set of microarray profiling data sets have been released by atgenexpress group ( 68 ) , including the data sets derived from different developmental stages or various treatments of arabidopsis , providing a systematic view of transcriptional regulation in response to environmental or developmental factors . meanwhile , 
 next generation sequencing has also enabled us to analyse plant gene functions from different perspectives . on one hand , 
 sequencing information helps us understand features of genomic sequences as well as epigenetic regulations of plants such as methylation or microrna binding on particular loci ( 9,10 ) ; on the other hand , as more plant species are in the sequencing pipeline , comparative genomic approaches make evolutionary studies of plant pathways available . 
 for example the orthologs of abi3 proteins in the moss physcomitrella patens were found to be functional in drought tolerance responses ( 11 ) , indicating that aba regulation is at least partly conserved between early land plants and seed plants . 
 these approaches are highly relied on the information about genetic and biochemical interactions among various genes or components , and often utilize mathematical methods to integrate and model verified experimental data sets , leading to conceptual understanding of complex regulatory networks . 
 one example is a recently published work using mathematical modeling to illustrate how polaris gene functions and interacts with auxin , ethylene and cytokinin in arabidopsis ( 12 ) . in an attempt to cover the above - mentioned advances and extending the functionality of the previous ahd , we have updated our database from its first version to ahd2.0 . in this update version , we made tremendous modifications and improvements to the original database and added several new features to cater to nowadays interests 
 . first , we manually updated our collection of ahrg genes based on most recent publications ( the latest 2-year literatures ) as well as corrected information ( e.g. the arguable aba receptors ) . 
 besides , elaborate schematic diagrams of phytohormone biosynthesis and signaling pathways are constructed and provided in ahd2.0 , which represents the first effort to integrate a large volume of data sets into a comprehensive regulatory network for each hormone ; second , we integrated orthologs of sequenced plants in orthomcl - db ( 13 ) into each gene in the database for comparative genomic or evolution studies of phytohormone related genes ; third , we predicted microrna splicing site of each gene . 
 the sequence of each binding site is now also available for performing further analysis such as primer design ; fourth , we provided the genetic relationship of these phytohormone related genes manually curated based on published literatures ; fifth , for the convenience of in - time bioinformatics analysis , we provided links to a powerful online analysis platform weblab , which was recently developed by us . 
 it allows users to readily perform various sequence analysis with these phytohormone related genes retrieved from the database ; finally , we provided links to other protein databases as well as more expression profiling information that would facilitate users for a more systematic and integrative analysis for phytohormone research . 
 based on these newly developed features , ahd2.0 would greatly intensify and expand its capability in the systematic studies of plant hormone responses . 
 compared with ahd , gene entries have increased from 1026 to 1318 ( figure 1a ) . 
 the increased entries are all manually curated based on the recent 2-year literatures from september 2008 to august 2010 . 
 these newly added gene entries were categorized by hormones , while the mutants related to those genes were classified by their phenotype ontology that was developed in ahd . in ahd , 
 a number of genes were considered as ahrgs merely based on annotation from gene ontology . while in ahd2.0 , with a large number of genetic studies using mutants and transgenically overexpressing or silencing lines had been incorporated to some of these genes , 
 the number of mutants ( or genes with verified genetic evidence ) in the database was increased by 76% .

 color in blue represents the numbers in ahd and color in red represents the numbers in ahd2.0 . besides , we modified existed information based on the most recent publications . 
 for instance , gcr2 and fca were classified into aba receptors in ahd , but in ahd2.0 these genes have been re - classified into aba signaling category due to the recent suspicion 
 . meanwhile gtg1/2 and pyr / pyl / pcar were added into ahd2.0 and were classified into aba receptors based on current studies ( 4,14 ) . for epigenetic study users , we now provide predicted microrna splicing site of each gene . 
 prediction of the potential interactions between micrornas and genes utilized rnahybrid method as described ( 15 ) . in sum , we have predicted 954 microrna splicing site targeting on hormone related genes .

 we have updated our previous version of ahd and renamed it as ahd2.0 . with the tremendous expansion of gene collection and correction , as well as newly developed features and web tools 
 , we believe that ahd2.0 would be more efficient and powerful for the systems biology studies of plant hormone functions and mechanisms . 
 these kinds of integrative research would allow a better understanding of the phytohormone regulatory network in myriad plant responses and eventually lead to the proficient manipulation of phytohormone action to improve plant fitness , defense and crop yield . 
 comparative or evolutionary studies are powerful methods in uncovering essential mechanisms in plant responses due to the fact that each complex network is originated from simple state and is fixed by nature selection ( 17 ) . 
 analyzing function of ortholog genes in ancestors or related species may indicate the origin , adjustment as well as function in particular responses of a pathway . 
 ahd2.0 will benefit users in searching orthologs of hormone related genes and performing necessary analysis from quick access to weblab ( figure 3 ) . 
 based on ortholog groups retrieved from ahd2.0 , multiple sequence alignment can be performed using clustal software in weblab ( a ) . 
 it reveals that in lower plant such as the moss physcomitrella patens ( with the i d 175000002 and 120199 ) , although ortholog proteins of atrga1 had been evolved , della motif is lacked in the moss . 
 della motif can be visualized by using weblogo in weblab ( b ) . and phylogenetic tree can be constructed by fneighbor in weblab based on n - j algorism ( c ) , which indicates systematic relationship of these ortholog genes . a case for the application of weblab .

 second , statistic methods can be used in analyzing information retrieved from ahd2.0 . take interactions between microrna and hormone related genes as an example . 
 based on on - line information , the majority of genes interacted with microrna are related to auxin and abscisic acid ( figure 4a ) . 
 interestingly , our database and analysis revealed that 88% ethylene related genes have interactions with microrna ( figure 4b ) , indicating that ethylene response pathways are probably extensively under small rna regulation , which is supported by previous findings ( 1820 ) . 
 auxin and abscisic acid related genes predicted to have more mirna targets , as shown in ( a ) .

 the percentages of genes predicted to have mirna binding sites in each hormone category are shown in ( b ) , in which a red line marked out the average percentage of 72.38% . in another application , genetic interactions can be used as important resources in systems biology study . 
 detailed schematic diagrams illustrating biosynthesis , perception as well as transduction process of phytohormones would enable phytohormone researchers to get more comprehensive view of phytohormone actions 
 . meanwhile , these diagram model ( nodes with connections by arrowhead or perpendicular lines ) can be changed into boolean networks through a simple transformation , which may facilitate for mathematical modeling by employing boolean rules and binary values as well ( 21,22 ) . 
 based on 911 nodes and 2608 edges provided in ahd2.0 , a combination of genetic interactions may enable us to draw a relatively complete regulatory network of phytohormones , which may assist systematic users performing theoretical analysis ( figure 5 ) . 
 it should be pointed out that interactions among hormones are too intricate to be concluded by simple up or down regulations , because they are under the influence of tissue and treatment specificity . 
 for example for the reason that some of the aba related genes are seed - specific genes , the relationship of ethylene and aba is different in drought tolerance and seed germination ( 23 ) . 
 the addition of more expression profiling data sets and the powerful on - line analysis platform are believed to be able to facilitate detailed researches . as for systems biology 
 , conclusions could be heuristically derived when data sets from different angles are perfectly integrated .

"approximately , 1.6 million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year throughout the world . 
 since carcinogenesis is caused by the stepwise accumulation of genetic changes , it is very important to understand the alterations of chromosome and gene in cancer cells . the traditional giemsa banding ( g - banding ) technique is applied to detect cell sample with a higher mitotic index , but lung cancer cells have a lower mitotic index , which makes karyotypic analysis difficult . in our study , combining with the latest molecular biology techniques , we investigated the chromosomal and genetic alterations in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line om . here

 giemsa - banding analysis revealed chromosomal aberrations on all chromosomes except , 4 , 8 , 14 , 15 , 17 , and 19 . 
 the structurally abnormal chromosomes were analyzed by multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization ( m - fish ) . as was illustrated in figure 2 , 
 chromosome 10 is the most frequently ( 95% ci : 29100% ) involved in translocations with six different interchromosomal translocations , and its frequency was 46 times in each sample . 
 the other chromosomes involved in translocation were chromosomes 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 16 , and 18 , and the 95% ci minimum value of each statistical datum was more than 9% .

 lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer - related morbidity and mortality worldwide . unlike in leukemia research 
 , lung cancer cell has a lower cell mitotic index , which makes karyotypic analysis difficult . 
 using modern genetic technologies , we investigated the chromosome and gene alterations in human lung adenocarcinoma of cell line om . 
 the goal of our study is to identify the alterations of chromosome and gene in human lung adenocarcinoma cell line om , which may provide new insights into the mechanisms of tumorigenesis . with high - resolution g - banding techniques , both the numerical and structural chromosomal abnormalities were observed . 
 g - banding analysis revealed that the changes in chromosome number were present in most cells , and either aneuploidy or polyploidy was identified within them . 
 in om cell line , certain chromosomes frequently participated the structural rearrangement , prominent among them being chromosome 3 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 18 , and y. although g - banding is a fundamental technique for cytogenetic study , it has limited utility in instances of cryptic or very complex rearrangements . 
 m - fish is a powerful technique that can be used for identifying uniquely all 24 chromosome types of the human genome . 
 the m - fish image showed that the highest frequency of translocation was in chromosome 10 . in genetics , 
 a chromosome translocation is caused by rearrangement of parts between nonhomologous chromosomes , and the distinct classes of chromosomal rearrangements create proto - oncogenes . 
 loci on chromosome 10 include microseminoprotein beta , which encodes beta - microseminoprotein , a primary constituent of semen and a proposed prostate cancer biomarker . 
 moreover , multiple tumor - suppressive genes are located in chromosome 10 , and the translocations of chromosome 10 may lead to damage of these tumor - suppressive genes . 
 therefore , frequent translocations of chromosome 10 in cell line om may be catastrophic genomic events and play key roles in tumorigenesis . in general , regional gains on chromosome 
 indicate that oncogenes may exist in this region , while the chromosome losses have been interpreted as an evidence that the region has affected a certain tumor suppressor genes . 
 cgh analysis revealed that gain regions were observed on chromosomes 3q25.3 - 28 , 5p13 , and 12q22 - 23.24 , which indicated that there may exist oncogenes that were activated in the gain regions . while loss regions were detected in chromosome 3p25 - 26 , 6p25 , 
 6q26 - 27 , 7q34 - 36 , 8p22 - 23 , 9p21 - 24 , 10q25 - 26.3 , 12p13.31 - 13.33 , and 17p13.1 - 13.3 , which indicated that some tumor suppressor genes may be located in these regions . 
 it is well - known that tumor suppressor genes p16 and p53 were located in chromosome 9p21 and 17p13 , respectively . 
 based on the above results , we detected amplification of genes at chromosome band 3q24 - 28 by pcr in the cell lines . 
 the genes bche , mme , kng , and si were amplified in the chromosomal region . 
 the bche gene provides instructions for making the pseudocholinesterase enzyme , which has a variety of physiological effects such as the metabolism of the cocaine and heroin and the breakdown of organophosphorus esters . 
 recent studies indicated that bche gene was amplified in the cells of lung carcinomas , which were consistent with our results . 
 observed the amplification of genes bche and slc2a2 at 3q26 in squamous cell lung carcinomas , whereas no amplification has been found in genes mme and kng . 
 mme gene is expressed in both normal and neoplastic cells as a common acute leukemia antigen . 
 in squamous cell lung carcinoma , the high mme gene expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival . 
 there were many studies on the expression of mme gene in lung cancer cells ; however , these results were quite conflicting . 
 many factors may be responsible for the difference among the results , such as experimental conditions , experimental methods , and pathological types of lung cancer . 
 the kng gene , which is one of the members of a cystatin - like superfamily , has potential roles in angiogenesis and ( or ) tumor development . 
 kinins that derived from kng involved in cell proliferation , leukocyte activation , cell migration , endothelial cell activation , and nociception . 
 thought that kng may be a novel therapeutic target in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and the possible association with prognosis . 
 we observed that kng gene was amplified in lung adenocarcinoma cell line om , which suggested that kng gene was likely to be involved in tumorigenesis of lung cancer cells . 
 although there are numerous studies elucidating the role of si gene in the digestion of dietary carbohydrates , there are limited data indicating a specific involvement of si gene in the genesis of human cancers . our experiments demonstrated that si gene was amplified on chromosome band 3q24 - 28 . since cancer is attributed to multi - genetic alterations accumulated in the cells , we speculated si gene may be involved in tumorigenesis.in summary , our findings suggested that most of those examined cells exhibited multiple complex karyotypes in human lung adenocarcinoma cell line om . 
 chromosome 10 was frequently involved in chromosomal translocation , which may be catastrophic genomic events and play key roles in tumorigenesis . according to the results of cgh 
 , we speculated that the oncogenes may be located at 3q25.3 - 28 , 5p13 , and 12q22 - 23.24 , while tumor suppressor genes may exist in 3p25 - 26 , 6p25 , 6q26 - 27 , 7q34 - 36 , 8p22 - 23 , 9p21 - 24 , 10q25 - 26.3 , 12p13.31 - 13.33 , and 17p13.1 - 13.3 . in human lung adenocarcinoma cell line 
 om , at least four genes ( mme , si , bche , and kng ) were involved in carcinogenesis .

 carcinogenesis is caused by the stepwise accumulation of genetic and chromosomal changes . 
 the aim of this study was to investigate the chromosome and gene alterations in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line om.methods:we used giemsa banding and multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization focusing on the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line om to analyze its chromosome alterations .

"aortocaval fistula ( acf ) mostly results from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm ( raaa ) , with a reported overall prevalence of 2% to 6% in patients with raaa . 
 these patients are always under emergency situations , which have a high mortality , but their clinical presentations may be quite variable . because this disease has variable clinical manifestations , 
 the diagnosis is usually delayed , which increases the difficulties in treatment . both conventional open repair ( or ) and endovascular aneurysm repair ( evar ) have been used to treat this condition . 
 however , no patients with abdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm rupturing into inferior vena cava ( ivc ) have been reported , and there is also no standard therapy for this condition . because morphologic and hemodynamic characteristics of dissection are different from abdominal aortic aneurysm ( aaa ) , evar may be a more valid alternative over or in these patients . 
 we present a patient with acf from rupture of abdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm , which had a chronic course of disease . 
 evar was successfully performed for this patient , without endoleak and fistula at the follow - up . 
 prior to referral to our institution , the 70-year - old man had recurrent cough , anhelation , and chest distress . 
 about half a year before he came to our hospital , he had temporary abdominal pain , which disappeared spontaneously and suddenly . 
 he was treated as pneumonia at the local hospital . however , these symptoms aggravated gradually , so he was transferred to our hospital for further treatment . he had a history of tobacco abuse and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , but no history of hypertension or heart disease . 
 physical examination revealed blood pressure of 126/63 mm hg , heart rate of 85  beats / min , and slight pitting edema of both lower extremities below the knee . 
 moist crackles could be documented on both lungs , and respiratory sounds were weakened at bilateral lower lobe of lung . 
 no abdominal tenderness or rebound tenderness was found , but a pulsating mass with continuous vascular bruit was recognized at the lower abdomen , without abdominal thrill . 
 laboratory results showed no hepatic or kidney dysfunction , hgb of 124  g / l , wbc of 12.29    10/l , bnp of 2625 pg / ml , troponin - t of 40.6 ng / l . chest computed tomography scans before admission showed severe pulmonary edema and inflammation ( figure 1a ) . 
 a later computed tomography angiography ( cta ) revealed an abdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm with an associated aortocaval fistula , no bleeding or hematoma in retroperitoneal space ( figure 1b ) . 
 echocardiography demonstrated that left ventricular ejection fraction was 45% , without abnormality of heart structure . 
 a , chest ct scans before admission revealed bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrations and patchy shadow in both lungs , partial pulmonary atelectasis of both inferior lobes , together with a little pleural effusion . 
 b , preoperative reconstructed ct scan showed dissecting aneurysm and early opacification of inferior vena cava ( ivc ) , which indicated dissecting aneurysm had ruptured to form an aortocaval fistula ( arrow ) . 
 this elderly patient had a severe pulmonary disease and chronic heart failure ( chf ) , thus traditional or was extremely risky for him . however , because of the ruptured abdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm and the persistent venous hypertension , this patient had a critical need for operation . 
 minimally invasive endovascular intervention was performed immediately after the diagnosis was confirmed . under general anesthesia , bilateral common femoral arteries 
 this patient 's anatomy was suitable for evar according to cta and intraoperative angiography ( figures 2 and 3a ) . because the angle of neck was about 65 and this patient 's rarely complex condition , we implanted medtronic endurant suprarenal aortic devices . a bifurcated stent graft ( enbf2516c170ee ) , 
 2 contralateral iliac limbs ( enlw1613c120ee , enlw1620c120ee ) , and an ipsilateral extension ( enlw1616c95ee ) were placed . 
 after these stent grafts were placed , proximal type i endoleak and fistula could be seen from angiography . to close the endoleak and fistula , 
 finally , the endoleak and aortocaval fistula disappeared , which suggested evar was successful ( figure 3 ) . 
 a , computed tomographic angiography ( cta ) revealed false lumen of aorta ( ao ) directly rupturing into inferior vena cava ( ivc ) through a 6.9  mm fistula ( arrow a ) , and the maximal diameters of this dissecting aneurysm was 89  mm . 
 b , cta showed the aorta divides into true and false lumen through a 27.4  mm tear ( arrow b ) , which formed the abdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm . 
 c , cta showed the diameter of neck was 21.3  mm ( arrow c ) . 
 d , reconstructed ct scan revealed the length of neck is about 20  mm ( arrow d ) , and the angle of the neck is about 65. ct  =  computed tomography . 
 a , angiography showed fistula ( arrow a ) between false lumen of dissecting aneurysm and early opacification of inferior vena cava ( ivc ) . 
 b , after endografts were placed , angiography revealed proximal type i endoleak ( arrow b ) and early opacification of ivc ( arrow c ) . 
 c , after balloon dilatation was performed , angiography showed the endoleak and aortocaval fistula had disappeared . 
 he experienced a lengthy postoperative course including 20 days in intensive care unit due to pulmonary edema and pneumonia . 
 he was initially maintained on venous thrombus embolism ( vte ) prophylaxis with heparin during operation and then switched to low molecular weight heparin after operation . 
 when he discharged , edema of both lower limbs had resolved , and not only the pulmonary edema but also pneumonia had significantly relieved ( figure 4a ) . on the follow - up of 9th month , cta showed successful endovascular exclusion without endoleak or recurrent fistula . 
 a , chest ct scan before discharge showed pulmonary edema and inflammation had significantly relieved . from ( b ) and ( c ) , cta at the follow - up of 9th month after operation revealed no endoleak or fistula . 
 it is reported that the overall prevalence of acf is quite low , about 2% to 6% in patients with raaa . 
 the most common cause of acf is aneurysm erosion , especially in patients with raaa . on account of increased venous hypertension 
 however , acf usually results from raaa , so its most frequent symptoms should be abdominal pain and hemorrhagic shock . in our case , without bleeding in the retroperitoneal space , abdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm ruptured directly into ivc to form a fistula , which led to venous hypertension . therefore , the hemodynamics and clinical presentations of this patient were different from cases before . 
 in addition , fistula between false lumen of dissecting aneurysm and ivc is small , and the blood flow of false lumen in this case is much lower than that of true lumen . 
 therefore , the low blood flow of this fistula leads to chf and chronic pulmonary congestion , and the chronic pulmonary congestion may be the reason of repeated pneumonia for this patient . 
 the dramatic clinical presentation in this case is rare , which leads to delay of diagnosis . 
 another potential reason of delayed diagnosis may lie in the local doctor 's lack of associated knowledge . according to some reports , early diagnosis and intervention can double survival rates from 25% to 50% . 
 the diagnosis was not made until enhanced computed tomography was performed half a year after initial presentation , which was unfortunate for the patient . 
 the venous hypertension had leaded to a series of severe complications , such as pneumonia and heart failure . 
 in addition , patients with ruptured aortic aneurysm need emergency operation according to the guideline . 
 it is unknown whether endovascular intervention improves survival compared with traditional or for this disease . with the risk related to chf , massive intraoperative blood loss , and pulmonary infection , the surgical mortality of open repair ranges from 16% to 66% . 
 evar is valid in certain anatomical configurations and may be the optimal selection in terms of stent graft available . and 
 evar has potential benefits of less blood loss and no need for aortic cross - clamping during operation . 
 several cases of evar for raaa with acf have been described , with about 30% mortality , which had partially due to delays in diagnosis . accompanied with chf and chronic pulmonary congestion , the general condition of the elderly patient in our case was poor , he was not suitable for or . meanwhile , the anatomical configurations of our patient were suitable for evar . 
 furthermore , the morphologic and hemodynamic characteristics of dissecting aneurysm in our case are different from aaa or dissection before . therefore , evar was the best choice for this patient . in our case 
 , evar alone appears to have successfully isolated abdominal aortic dissecting aneurysm and closed the acf without the need of a stent - graft in the ivc . because of aortocaval fistulas and type ii endoleak 
 , persistent communication between the aneurysm and the ivc may exist . in some literatures , early placement of stent graft in the ivc 
 . however , no evidence demonstrated stent graft of ivc should be placed at the time of initial evar . because the chance of persistent aortocaval fistula after evar is rather small , endoleak and fistula 
 if persistent aortocaval fistula occurs , stent graft in ivc can be performed in the future . in our case , 
 no fistula or endoleak were found at the follow - up of the 9th month . 
 in addition , because aneurysm sac debris may dislodge , prophylaxis of pulmonary embolism should be addressed . in our case , 
 however , the chance of clinically significant pulmonary embolism is minute , and ivc filter placement may complicate the possible further ivc stent - graft placement . 
 diagnosis of this patient was delayed , but he fortunately had a successful operation and recovered finally . despite his poor general status and the high mortality associated with this condition , his complete recovery presents the potential for recovery with appropriate treatment . 
 further educational programs should be developed , which may give rise to earlier diagnosis and treatment with better outcomes .","aortocaval fistula acf mostly results ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm raaa reported overall prevalence patients raaa

"the enclosure of eukaryotic genomes within the nuclear envelope evolutionarily generated the necessity to transport macromolecules selectively between nucleus and cytoplasm . 
 following their synthesis in cytoplasm , histones and nucleic acid polymerases have to reach the nucleus , while specifically cytoplasmic proteins have to be kept out . 
 mature mrna , trna and rrna molecules and their associated proteins have to follow the opposite route , while their immature precursors have to be kept in 1 . , 2 . , 3 . , 4 . , 5 .. eukaryotic mrna is enzymatically metabolized and compacted with proteins within nuclei to generate functional messenger ribonucleoprotein ( mrnp ) particles 6 . 
 , 7 .. the control of protein biosynthesis involves regulation of intranuclear functions with participation of specific proteins , many of which seem to enter from the cytoplasm as a time - specific event 3 . , 4 . , 5 . 
 , 7 .. the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( hnrnps ) comprise a group of important regulators engaged in these cellular processes 8 . , 9 . , 10 .. extensive research efforts have been devoted to the cloning and molecular characterization of numerous ribonucleoproteins ( rnps ) in the context of their active role in mrna biogenesis and metabolism 1 . 
 , 2 . , 9 . , 10 . , 11 . , as well as in terms of their involvement as autoantigens in human diseases ( 11 ) . 
 hence , emphasis is put on the roles of various rna - binding motifs and their subsequent roles in governing cellular activities , both in health and pathology ( 9 ) . 
 recently , there has been considerable interest in the participation of these rna - binding particles in triggering the immune response in human autoimmune disorders ( 11 ) . 
 substantial research both at cdna and protein level have been performed on immunochemical features of human autoantigens ( http://www.zoo.uni-heidelberg.de/mol_evol/mb/ana_base.html ) . 
 of particular interest is the group of mammalian hnrnps , which constitutes a part of spliceosome , which itself is an autoimmune target ( 12 ) . 
 novel nucleotide sequences are continuously reported , which afterwards are used to delineate homology among various members based on previously determined nucleotides and protein sequences . 
 the mechanism of contribution of numerous hnrnps with a similar structural rnp motif ( 13 ) to the induction of different immune reactions is sequence - specific ( 14 ) . 
 phylogenetic approach is essential to find functionally important genomic sequences based on detection of their high degree of conservation across different species . 
 such approach shows the level of improvement of the prediction of gene - regulatory elements in the human genome . 
 this necessitates the study of the degree of homology of rna recognition motifs ( rrm ) among these proteins , requiring an evolutionary computation . 
 having considered the importance of submitting new sequences for further functional characterization , the newly cloned and expressed cdna of previously unknown member of the hnrnp a / b family of proteins ( figure 1 ) is presented here . 
 its rna - binding properties and tissue - specific gene expression profiles were recently determined ( 15 ) . based on the concept of correlation between sequences and rna - binding modes , a systemic search was performed for nucleic acid association by evaluating sequence conservation using multiple sequence alignments search tools . 
 the aim of the presented work herein was to isolate novel cdna sequences with important functional implications in human pathology . 
 our efforts have been devoted to the cloning and subsequent tissue - specific gene expressions of numerous human rnps from the hnrnp a / b family of proteins ( figure 1 ; ref . 
 the objective was to search for molecular basis of autoimmunity by applying comparative analysis of the sequences of diverse autoantigens . in this context 
 , evolutionary computation approach could give us major clues on how evolutionarily conserved mrna transport machinery fails are linked to development of human autoimmune disorders . 
 we were mainly interested in cdnas , which might encode the yet undescribed hnrnp b2 . 
 the need for this was based on two observations . on the one hand , autoantibodies directed against hnrnp a2 crossreact with hnrnp b1 and hnrnp b2 . since hnrnp b1 is an alternatively spliced variant of hnrnp a2 , this suggests that hnrnp b2 might be an alternatively spliced form of hnrnp a2/b1 . 
 however , no attempts to clone a cdna encoding hnrnp b2 were successful so far . 
 on the other hand , cdnas closely related to hnrnp a1 and hnrnp a2 have been previously isolated from a human fetal brain library and from a xenopus laevis library , respectively . their close relationships with hnrnp a2 suggested that one of these cdnas might actually encode hnrnp b2 ( 15 ) . 
 to isolate the searched cdna , human liver and brain cdna expression libraries were screened by pcr using primers complementary to 5- and 3-untranslated regions of the fbrnp cdna . 
 since the obtained new sequence shared close identity to the xenopus laevis hnrnp a3 cdna sequence ( entrez ; accession number l02956 ) , the protein was termed human hnrnp a3 . 
 nucleotide sequence comparisons between fbrnp , xenopus laevis hnrnp a3 and our newly determined human hnrnp a3 proteins revealed that extensive sequence conservation exist in rna - binding regions . 
 the majority of sequence variations were seen at the gly - rich domain , composed of amino acids at positions 211 - 373 . 
 these sequences were observed more at nucleotide level , as expected , compared to the translated protein sequences ( figure 2 ) . 
 only protein sequences are shown for brevity . identification of various nucleic acid - binding domains of diverse hnrnps was achieved by cloning and sequencing of cdnas encoding these motifs . in general , all known human hnrnp proteins contain at least one rna - binding module and one another auxiliary domain fragment . 
 the rna - binding motifs contain the rnp consensus sequences ( cs - rbd ) , the rna recognition motif ( rrm ; ref . 
 , 13 . , 17 . ) , the rnp-80 motif , the rgg box ( 18 ) , and the kh domain ( 19 ) . 
 this domain is found in hnrnps in various amounts , ranging from 1 ( in hnrnp c ) to 4 ( e. g. in poly a - binding protein ; ref . 
 figure 1 shows the general modular structure of hnrnp a / b type of rnp particles . 
 their general structure is composed of two domains : the first 195 residues comprise the so - called up1 domain , containing two canonical rna - recognition motifs ( rrm 1 and rrm 2 ) , each of which is comprised from the conserved rnp-2 and rnp-1 submotifs . 
 the gly - rich c - terminal domain comprises an rgg box and a nuclear localization motif . 
 this motif contributes to protein - protein interaction patterns , as well as to subcellular localization ( 18 ) . 
 two conserved solvents exposed phe residues at the centre of the -sheet in each rrm - contacted rna . 
 the least conserved 3 loop in u1a is engaged in extensive rna interactions , whose conformation changes upon rna binding 17 . 
 , 20 .. the rnp domain interacts with a flexible single - strand rna and the -sheet provides a large surface for extensive interaction with nucleotides . 
 regions outside of the rrm may also play important roles in rna binding ( 10 ) . 
 identification of these motifs as rna - binding domains has been used for prediction of this activity in various proteins of yet undescribed function possessing these domains . 
 as seen in figure 2 , the newly isolated human hnrnp a3 cdna encodes a protein of 296 amino acids ( a.a . ) . 
 amino acids numbered 198 comprise rbd1 , 112209 comprise rbd2 , 209296 comprise the gly - rich domain , while 99111 contain inter - rrm linker ( irl ) segments . to our surprise , comparison with the previously reported fbrnp cdna sequence , encoding a 269 a.a . 
 therefore , it was assumed that the currently presented cdna encodes a novel and yet undescribed protein . despite the close homologies among the rna - binding regions ( 95% ) , 
 remarkable differences can be seen in the c - terminal domain ( figure 2 ) , where deletions and insertions are apparent . 
 shorter and there are fewer conserved residues in the c - terminal part . both cdnas also show high homologies to the cdna encoding hnrnp a3 from xenopus laevis except for a stretch of 14 a.a . at the rbd1 n - terminal part . 
 the rna - binding regions of the three proteins are almost identical , while the auxiliary domains are less conserved . 
 the xenopus laevis protein shows 75% homology with fbrnp and 83% with the newly cloned human hnrnp a3 protein , respectively ( figure 2 ) . 
 the reduced length of the human hnrnp a3 , as compared to the xenopus laevis homologue ( 296 vs. 373 a.a . ) , is compatible with differences observed between xenopus laevis and rat hnrnp a1 , which are composed of 365 and 320 residues , respectively ( 15 ) . 
 the assumption that the presented clone encodes the human counterpart of frog hnrnp a3 is further reinforced , when conserved residues in the auxiliary domains of the a / b polypeptides are considered . 
 thus , a stricking homology is apparent at the c - terminus , which is well conserved between frog and human hnrnp a3 with 15 of the last 18 a.a . 
 both proteins end with a triplet rrf , which is also present in hnrnp a1 , but neither in fbrnp nor in hnrnp a2/b1 . moreover , a glutamic acid located at the boundary of rbd2 and the auxiliary domains of xenopus laevis and human hnrnp a3 ( a.a . 
 position 207 ) is substituted by valine in fbrnp , a further indication that the novel protein is indeed the human counterpart of xenopus laevis hnrnp a3 . 
 interestingly , this result is reported also for the murine hnrnp mbx protein , which is highly homologous to both human fbrnp and xenopus laevis hnrnp a3 ( 21 ) . 
 most of the conformational differences between the two rrms occur either at the c - terminal end of the b helices , or at the tip of loop 3 , which is tilted and twisted in rrm1 , as opposed to rrm2 ( figure 3 ) . 
 the rnp domain interacts with a flexible single - strand rna and the -sheet provides a large surface for extensive interaction with nucleic acids . 
 the two aromatic side chains of rnp1 and one aromatic side chain of rnp2 provide a convenient template for base stacking of the rna with neighbouring protein side chains , forming hydrogen bonds with the stacked bases . 
 although the major groove of the a - type rna helix is too narrow and deep to provide a site for sequence - specific association , an rna loop with exposed nucleotides provides a large surface for protein binding . 
 however , the rna - binding is not a unique feature of the -sheets . despite the evolutionary conservation of the rrms , which are necessary for both general and sequence - specific nucleic acid binding 
 , regions outside of the rrms may also play important roles in rna binding ( 10 ) . 
 for instance , the flexibility of the linker sequence connecting both rrms , resulting from two pairs of arg and asp involved in irl salt bridges and the ordered residues , creates a position which is highly probable for this sequence to be involved in direct rna binding . 
 figure 3 shows the rrm sequences of 12 hnrnp a / b type of proteins , extending the previous data set of mayeda et al . 
 there is extensive sequence homology between these various proteins , which are conserved throughout evolution from insects to man . 
 each of the rrms forms an ungapped alignment with both rrms of hnrnp a1 . in all of the shown proteins , 
 the evolutionary links between the rrms of human hnrnp a3 and other hnrnp a / b proteins are depicted in a phylogenetic tree ( figure 4 ) . 
 the sequences of rrm1 and rrm2 cluster in two separate groupings , representing insect and vertebrate proteins . 
 the patterns of branching for rrm1 and rrm2 sequences are nearly identical , except for the placement of the branch representing the minor human variant hnrnp a0 . 
 the almost identical pattern of branching for both rrms suggests that these fragments have evolved in parallel . 
 obviously , each of the insect and vertebrate proteins is equally distant from each other . 
 apparently , this fact indicates independent gene duplications of ancestral hnrnp a / b - like protein , in agreement with mayeda et al . 
 the independent evolution of individual tandemly repeated protein domains and their functional relevance has always being an intriguing issue . the rnp domain is commonly encountered scaffold among the nearly 350 different folds , that is , the favourable secondary arrangements of around 10,000 protein structures covered by the currently used databases 22 . , 23 . , 24 . , 25 .. comparisons of various protein structures , in combination with their nucleotide analyses serve as a clue for their evolution . 
 the debate is whether these structures have evolved for achievement of specific functions or for thermodynamic stability and/or for kinetic folding reasons . 
 the same structural topology can determine numerous activities , preserved through evolution . in biological systems , enzymes evolve by acquiring of new thermodynamic or kinetic properties by the already existing protein folds . 
 generally , only the overall folding pattern is conserved in protein groups , and as the sequence diverges , the structures deform . among the widespread catalytic folds , such as the tim barrel and the globins 
 , the rrm domain attracts research efforts into delineating the advancements of evolution starting from all  - helical proteins via all -sheet proteins and reaching a group of /-proteins . in this route 
 , the /-barrel is the most frequently seen enzymatic fold and appears to be a selected topology for the directed evolution of new biocatalysts . 
 it is worth studying how the present /-barrels are linked evolutionarily to each other and through which way they have evolved from simpler ancestors . 
 the topic becomes more attractive when these folds comprise a domain involved in a disease state , such as autoimmunity . 
 , 11 .. the rapidly growing information on structures and functions of numerous hnrnps will be invaluable for understanding the pathological mechanisms by which these particles participate as targets of autoantibodies . of particular interest is the determination of the role of rna - protein folding patterns in development of disease - specific epitope formation . in this context 
 , the evolution of selected nucleic acid - binding sequences and how this contributes to disease establishment remain unknown . 
 therefore , this study was devoted to presentation of evolutionary connections between the various hnrnps and their rna - binding domains . 
 a phylogenetic tree is given to depict these motifs in the major group of these particles , including also the recently cloned and sequenced novel human hnrnp a3 ( 15 ) , followed by remarks on the lastly selected sequences , relevant in diseases . figure 1 shows the general 2xrbd - gly type of structure of the a / b type of human hnrnps . 
 the two canonical rrm-1 and rrm-2 , containing the conserved rnp-2 and rnp-1 submoieties , and the rgg c - terminal part constitute the main domains . 
 the translated sequences of the recently characterized human hnrnp a3 particle is presented herein ( figure 2 ) , solely to demonstrate the high degree of sequence homology among the different rrms . 
 its protein sequence is compared to that of other two members of this protein family 
 the selected three members in figure 2 are functionally related quite distantly from each other , each having a buried core tryptophan and there are disulphide bonds on the highly conserved irl - segments ( 16 ) . 
 the sequence comparisons of the three closely related hnrnp a3 members showed that the general need for a large buried hydrophobic moieties is well satisfied . 
 this represents a possible case , where structural constraints make evolution towards a different conformation unlikely . 
 the high level of conservation of these residues is related to the interlocking interactions and restraints of the loop connecting the -sheets , by providing the huge hydrophobic template necessary for core packing . 
 in addition , having large hydrophobic inner part and suitable hydroxyls capable of hydrogen - bond formation , these residues ( e.g. tyrosines ) could be conserved for structural stability needs . performing amino acid mutations , or substitutions at the sites thus removing hydrophobic packaging interactions , would provide further evidence for the core packing of hnrnp globule . 
 these are buried in the compacted core and are expected to participate in overall folding of the scaffold . 
 however , to verify whether this is the case , more mutational analyses , combined with thermodynamic , kinetic , structural and evolutionary computation data are needed . 
 amino acid sequence comparisons of rrm structures ( figure 3 ) depicted the hydrophobic core residues , conserved among different rrms . 
 the inserted sequence of the human hnrnp a3 shared extensive sequence homology ( up to 90% ) existing between rrms of all these numerous proteins , which are conserved throughout evolution . a phylogenetic tree ( figure 4 ) depicted the evolutionary history of the rrms of human hnrnp a3 and other hnrnp a / b proteins . 
 the objective was to deduce whether the observed patterns of conservation resulted due to structural features for this type of fold architecture , or alternatively , were the consequence of divergent evolution . 
 parallel symmetric groupings of rrm1 and rrm2 in two different clusters , which belong to insect and vertebrate members is well seen . with the slight deviation of hnrnp a0 , 
 this branching pattern is an indication of parallel proceeding evolution , in accordance with relevant studies 16 . 
 , 26 .. each of the members of these two subgroups are equally distant from each other . 
 these results suggest that these branching patterns originated from an ancestral hnrnp a / b - like protein probably through independent gene duplications . 
 phylogenetic analyses of this sort provide evidence for evolutionary history and origin of the modular structure of hnrnps and their contemporary functional implications . 
 this approach helps to delineate whether rna - binding ( rbd ) and protein - protein ( auxiliary ) domains have evolved in parallel or follow another evolutionary history . in this context evolutionary computation on every newly characterized hnrnp particle 
 the sequence of human hnrnp a3 was inserted in the data set at figure 4 and becomes a further support of the evolutionary trend of these rnp family of proteins , appearing also in previous studies 16 . 
 , 26 .. these earlier studies proved that the origin of hnrnps is a consequence of independent gene duplication . in their landmark work , fukami - kobayashi et al . 
 ( 26 ) showed that the ancestral gene of the hnrnps had have two rna - binding domains even before the divergence of invertebrates and vertebrates and that it diverged to contemporary hnrnp genes while preserving the tandemly repeated structures . 
 the origin of natural selection of particular nucleotide sequences and their conservation from primitive rna - based catalysis to eukaryotic chromosome evolution remain to be elucidated ( http://manske.virtualave.net/genetik/vorlesung_ws99/teil1-3/rna_und_die_evolution.htm ; ref . 
 , there is now sufficient data to prove the substitution of ancestral rnas by more efficient rna - protein complexes with subsequent replacement of the latter by proteins ( 27 ) . by using molecular modelling approach , 
 it has been recently shown ( 28 ) that in this transition position , the two rna - binding sites of the simulated proto - protein interact with target sites to form a stable rnp complex . since the selected proteins were unable to resolve misfolded rna , in vivo selected protein associated with the two rna - binding sites , indicating that the protein facilitates the correct folding of the ribozyme . 
 this provides evidence that these modelled self - splicing rna - protein complexes can be considered as a primitive form of splicing factors or rna chaperones , which contribute to correct rna folding ( 28 ) . in terms of molecular evolution of primitive catalysts , 
 these self - splicing intron assemblies possibly became splicing rnps , suggesting that an active rnp particles could have originated from a primordial ribozyme ( 28 ) . the evolutionary driving force for this 
 is the small structural cost , through which the protein binding compensates for some folding deficiencies in the rna ( 29 ) . 
 this serves as another proof that the evolution from rna to rnp - determined catalysis represents an evolutionary design against misfolding rather than for the maintenance of a protein binding site . 
 our preliminary biophysical results ( 30 ) suggest that this is the case with human hnrnp a3 , as well . 
 the current study presents the sequence conservation of mainly hydrophobic residues of human hnrnp a3 , which form the hydrophobic packing cores and are essentially and evolutionarily conserved in other rna - binding domains in the hnrnps studied ( fig . 
 this indicates that the rna - binding domains have evolved from a common hnrnp a / b - type proto - protein , supporting further previous models 16 . 
 , 26 .. interestingly , while the majority of models of rbd protein family built up to now are based on divergent evolutionary principles , another view claims that this is open to doubt in cases of similar , but more distantly related functions and structures ( 31 ) . 
 their model suggests that even though the ancient rbds could have developed separately by divergent evolution , these rbds have evolved conserved rnp motifs with a similar structure and function on similar surfaces . 
 the authors emphasize that rnp motifs are conserved both in scaffold architecture and in function , which provides an intriguing case of convergent evolution . 
 further advancements in sequence comparison techniques will help to understand whether these functional sites have arisen multiple times during evolution ( http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/infobio01/higgs1/pdf/higgs1.pdf ; ref . 
 22 . , 23 . , 24 . , 32 . ) . regarding the evolutionary conservation of hnrnp domains , 
 two possibilities exist for explaining their nowadays existence  they are either hyperadaptable , or they may have developed features required to perform vital cellular functions ( 32 ) . despite the case with cold shock domain ( 31 ) , hnrnp a / b proteins appear to possess eukaryotic origins , because prokaryotic homologs could not be detected until now . 
 all these rbds have similar dimerization roles leading to similar three - dimensional architectures , suggesting that they may have arisen from a common ancestor , which have diverged in sequence afterwards ( 32 ) . 
 these domains are found also in chloroplast protein sequences , implying the link with endosymbiont hypothesis , and also implys that the multicellularity in plants and animals did not evolved independently 26 . 
 , 32 .. domain evolution of hnrnps rises the question that whether they are consequences of continuous or discontinuous evolution . 
 fukami - kobayashi et al . ( 26 ) showed that the rbd fused with the sr - rich domain proceeded the divergence of splicing factors , and that these two domains have arisen together thus conserving the fused domain organization . 
 the existence of gly - rich domain ( figure 1 ) , also supports the proposal of domain organization of the unique origin of hnrnps , followed by duplication and divergence of rbds and structural transitions of the auxiliary domain ( 18 ) . 
 this indicates that the auxiliary domain shared by functionally related rnps diverged in parallel together with the rbds ( 26 ) . 
 it is thus implied , that these ancestral repeats must have oligomerized afterwards to adopt a similar structure seen in contemporary homologs ( 32 ) . in the light of the fact that hnrnp a / b particles 
 are considered as disease genes , an intriguing issue becomes the use of protein domain data of various hnrnps to delineate the link and etiology of diseases . as stated earlier , the majority of these gene activities related to autoantigenic hnrnps are covered by relevant databases . 
 respect , identification of human paralogous disease genes generates further pathological gene candidates to be sequenced , because paralogous genes are frequently encountered as mutated versions in similar diseases ( 32 ) . 
 the sequence comparison , however , may be insufficient for deduction of its functional role for patients diagnozed with the suspected disease . 
 therefore , we followed the suggestion of ponting , c.s . and russell , r.r . 
 ( 32 ) and combined our sequence determination of human hnrnp a3 with its gene expression profiles , its molecular interaction features ( 30 ) , and its tissue - specific gene expression patterns ( 15 ) . 
 interestingly , our molecular characterization of human hnrnp a3 showed that while the recombinant hnrnp a3 with its 296 a.a . 
 migrates as expected as a 32  kda protein on sds - page analysis , it is recognized by the patients sera as a 50  kda protein . 
 this is attributed to alternative splicing or due to tissue - specific expression of a highly related yet unknown crossreactive protein . 
 surprisingly , neither the 50  kda nor the 32  kda protein was detected in helanuclear extracts , further supporting the assumption that hnrnp a3 is not ubiquitously expressed as hnrnp a1 or hnrnp a2 . 
 northern blotting analysis showed the variable expression patterns of hnrnp a3 mrna in human tissues . 
 thus , it is highly expressed in spleen , ovary , small intestine , lung , liver , skeletal muscle , kidney and pancreas , whereas expression in thymus , testis , colon and peripheral blood was hardly detectable . 
 expression in prostata , heart , brain and placenta was low , but clearly detectable ( 15 ) . 
 in addition , circular dichroism and fluorescence spectroscopic measurements demonstrated that the human hnrnp a3 protein is a stable particle  the free energy of unfolding of the full - length hnrnp a3 is 58c , as shown by both urea and temperature denaturation ( 30 ) . 
 this particle increases its apparent stability upon interaction with rna fragments r(uuaggg)4 to higher temperature values . 
 the high binding affinity to this repeat indicates its preference for association with purine - rich consensus sequences and targeting features towards deleterious g - tetrad structures . 
 the latter fact suggests its active participation in alternative splicing  a common feature of well - known telomitic repeats interactions of hnrnp a1 . 
 this rna fragment , hnrnp a3 particle recognition , can act by facilitating the splicing of alternative intron of the pre - mrna . since this represents a case of regulation of splice - site selection with further functional implication in human disease 11 . 
 the first one is comprised of both rbd1 and rbd2 , and the second one is composed of rbd2 and certain parts of gly - rich domain 15 . , 30 .. this epitope recognition pattern differs from the epitope determined for the highly related hnrnp a1 and hnrnp a2 , respectively . 
 thus , in hnrnp 2 the rbd2 was found to contain the major epitope , which was recognized by patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythenathosus . 
 this particular region was also found to be essential for interaction with rna and the patients autoantibodies strongly inhibited rna binding . as oppose to these , autoantibodies derived from patients diagnozed with mixed connective tissue disease recognized an epitope comprising rbd1 and rbd2 . 
 interestingly , the major epitope of hnrnp a1 also comprises both rbds , which were also targeted by patients with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythemathosus . taken together , these data confirm that rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythemathosus and mixed connective tissue disease are immunochemically linked by systemic autoimmunity to the functionally important rna - binding regions of hnrnp a / b proteins . 
 the observed trend brings the question of why so closely related and evolutionarily conserved rbd domains are differentially recognized by the autoantibodies . 
 we proposed recently ( 30 ) the overall folding patterns of these domains , and the protein antigenicity arising from these patterns is the determining factor . 
 the present study combined with previously determined sequences of u1a , hnrnp c , hnrnp a1 and drosophila sex lethal ( sxl ) protein structures reveals that they have the same fold , but have different placing of the second and fourth -strands . 
 individual rrms have preferences towards various rna sequences , due to differences in surface amino acids found outside the conserved rnp submotifs . in our opinion 
 in certain cases , the two rrms somehow act in concerted fashion to give rise to the overall rna- and antibody - binding characteristics , whereas in other cases the presence of only one rrm is sufficient for autoantibody and rna recognition . 
 thus , rbd1 itself bound strongly to rna fragments , however , the joining of rbd2 to rbd1 that increased the overall affinity indicats that rbd2 also strongly affects rna - binding . 
 to isolate the cdna , human liver and brain cdna libraries were screened by pcr using primers complementary to sequences in the 5- and 3-untranslated regions of the fetal brain ( fbrnp ) cdna , as described ( 15 ) .

 they are composed of evolutionarily conserved and tandemly repeated motifs , where both rna - binding and protein - protein recognition occur to achieve cellular activities . by yet unknown mechanisms , these ribonucleoprotein ( rnp ) particles are targeted by autoantibodies and hence play significant role in a variety of human systemic autoimmune diseases . 
 this feature makes them important prognostic markers in terms of molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of autoimmunity . 
 since rnp domain is one of the most conserved and widespread scaffolds , evolutionary analyses of these rna - binding domains can provide further clues on disease - specific epitope formation . 
 the study presented herein represents a sequence comparison of rna - recognition regions of recently cloned and characterized human hnrnp a3 with those of other relevant hnrnp a / b - type proteins . 
 their implications in human autoimmunity are particularly emphasized ."
"in late february 2006 , a 27-year - old pregnant woman , at 6 weeks gestation , was referred to grenoble university hospital , grenoble , france , for investigation of persistent left cervical lymphadenopathy with fever . 
 the lymphadenopathy occurred 3 weeks earlier , along with a sore throat , and persisted despite 10 days treatment with amoxicillin ( 3 g daily ) . 
 at admission , the patient was febrile ( 38c ) and had a tender , swollen , submaxillary cervical lymph node on the left side . 
 magnetic resonance imaging of the left cervical region showed a large mass extending from the parotid region to the submandibular region , with hypo- and hypersignals in t1- and t2-weighted imaging , respectively . 
 lymph node tissue was obtained by needle aspiration , and examination revealed nonspecific lesions of lymphadenitis . 
 laboratory test results showed moderate inflammatory syndrome ( c - reactive protein 67 mg / l ) . 
 serologic results were negative for hiv , hepatitis b and c viruses , rubella virus , treponema pallidum ( syphilis ) , coxiella burnetii ( q fever ) , and borrelia , bartonella , brucella , and legionella spp . and showed only residual igg - type antibodies against cytomegalovirus , epstein - barr virus , herpes simplex virus , parvovirus , mycoplasma pneumoniae , and chlamydophila pneumoniae .   because we suspected 
 severe streptococcus pyogenes infection , a second course of amoxicillin was administered for 13 additional days . 
 after initial clinical improvement , the patient relapsed , and the lymphadenopathy evolved to suppuration and necrosis . in march 2006 
 , a large amount of pus was surgically drained from the site , and inflamed lymph nodes were removed . 
 the patient denied receiving any tick bite but reported that she regularly fed domestic rabbits in cages . 
 her symptoms began a few days after she killed and skinned rabbits , which were then kept frozen but not eaten by the family . 
 routine cultures and mycobacterial cultures remained sterile , but f. tularensis dna was detected in lymph node samples by using specific real - time pcr targeting the gene encoding a 23-kda surface protein ( 5 ) . 
 pcr amplification and sequencing of the 16s rdna23s rdna intergenic spacer region ( 5 ) directly from lymph node tissue confirmed the presence of dna from f. tularensis subsp . 
 serum samples collected in late february and on march 15 , 2006 , were tested by using an immunofluorescence assay and a homemade f. tularensis antigen ( 5 ) . 
 both samples were positive , with igm and igg titers of 320 ( cutoff titers of > 160 ) .   because the patient was pregnant and tularemia in france 
 holarctica ( 2 ) , which are naturally susceptible to macrolides , she was treated with azithromycin ( 500 mg / d for 6 weeks ) . 
 the patient reported that the rabbits were reared outdoors , in floor - level , wire - mesh cages ; therefore , we suspected the animals were infected with f. tularensis through contact with wild fauna . 
 attempts to detect f. tularensis in pieces of the frozen rabbits by culture and pcr tests were unsuccessful . 
 clinical symptoms of tularemia are primarily related to the portal of entry of bacteria , the f. tularensis strain virulence , and the immune status of the patient . 
 the incubation period is usually 13 days but may last up to 15 days ( 3,6 ) . 
 the primary clinical forms are glandular and ulceroglandular ( skin inoculation ) , oculoglandular ( conjunctival inoculation ) , oropharyngeal ( oral contamination ) , pneumonic ( inhalation of an infected aerosol ) , and typhoidal ( various modes of infection ) ( 2,7 ) . 
 tularemia may be severe and even fatal ; patients with lymphadenopathy may experience lymph node suppuration in 30% of cases ( 1 ) . 
 our patient s symptoms were fever , pharyngitis , and cervical lymphadenopathy ; treatment with a -lactam drug did not improve her condition , which rapidly evolved to local suppuration , a sign that should prompt physicians to consider oropharyngeal tularemia in disease - endemic regions . because tularemia cases remain extremely rare in the french alps , where the patient lived , this diagnosis was not considered at the time of the first medical consultation .   because the rabbit meat was not consumed by the patient , we suspected she became infected at the time she skinned these animals 
 however , the animals had no overt disease at the time they were killed , so low bacterial inoculum may explain why the tests performed on rabbit meat had negative results . diagnosis of tularemia is often made by serologic tests ( 3 ) , although these are negative during the first 2 weeks following the onset of symptoms ( 1 ) . in the case described here , 
 the same high antibody titers were obtained in 2 serum samples taken 2 weeks apart , which indicates that the peak secretion of specific antibodies was achieved . 
 culture of f. tularensis from clinical samples remains poorly sensitive , but pcr - based testing of pharyngeal swab specimens or lymph node suppurations or biopsy specimens enables rapid diagnosis of oropharyngeal tularemia and identification of the f. tularensis subspecies involved ( 1,4,5,7,8 ) . 
 a few tularemia cases occurring in pregnant women have been reported ( 9 ) . severe illness or death caused by infection with f. tularensis 
 could be a risk for a pregnant woman or her fetus ; the role of f. tularensis as an agent of abortion and intrauterine death is well recognized in sheep ( 10 ) but not in pregnant women . 
 a major difficulty in this instance was the choice of the antimicrobial drug regimen , because first - line antibiotics currently recommended for treatment of tularemia , including the aminoglycoside gentamicin , fluoroquinolones , and tetracyclines ( 1,2,7,8 ) , may be toxic for pregnant women or fetuses . no treatment recommendation for tularemia during pregnancy is available ( 9 ) . 
 the pregnancy outcome was favorable , and the patient and the infant were healthy at 12-month follow up . 
 macrolides are usually not recommended for treatment of tularemia patients ( 2,7,8 ) , especially because f. tularensis subsp . 
 holarctica biovar 2 strains , mainly found in eastern europe and asia , are naturally resistant to macrolides ( 1114 ) . 
 the ketolides ( e.g. , telithromycin ) are highly active against f. tularensis in vitro ( 11,15 ) , but their use in pregnant women is currently discouraged . 
 this case emphasizes the usefulness of azithromycin as a first - line treatment for tularemia in pregnant women in areas where infections caused by biovar 2 strains of f. tularensis subsp .","patient pregnant tularemia france holarctica naturally susceptible macrolides treated azithromycin mg weeks
tularemia may severe even fatal patients lymphadenopathy may experience lymph node suppuration cases
macrolides usually recommended treatment tularemia patients especially f tularensis subsp
case emphasizes usefulness azithromycin first line treatment tularemia pregnant women areas infections caused biovar strains f tularensis subsp","a pregnant woman who had oropharyngeal tularemia underwent treatment with azithromycin and lymph node resection and recovered without obstetrical complication or infection in the child . 
 azithromycin represents a first - line treatment option for tularemia during pregnancy in regions where the infecting strains of francisella tularensis have no natural resistance to macrolides ."
"one of the top priorities in therapeutics is pain control and in spite of the recent advances in clinical investigation of new therapeutic agents , pain relief is still a significant challenge . 
 the reasons include difficulties of correctly evaluating pain , underestimation of patients pain , misconceptions about analgesic use and side effects , gaps in pain management process , and lack of acute pain service.1 local anesthetics ( las ) are among the different classes of pharmacological compounds used to eliminate pain . 
 las are small molecules that could be easily eluted from the site of administration , thus limiting the analgesic property . 
 cocaine is the first compound that was used as a  numbing agent  in the early 1500s . 
 however , it is usually associated with the central nervous system and cardiovascular system toxicity . presently , most of the synthetic las are structurally related to cocaine but with reduced toxicity . 
 la works by cutting the signal of nerve impulses in nerve cell membranes through the shutting of voltage - gated na channels . 
 the degree of numbness from a certain concentration will depend on how the nerve is stimulated and the resting membrane potential.2 clinical las belong to one of the two classes : amino esters ( figure 1a ) and amino amide ( figure 1b ) . 
 ester - based las are hydrolyzed and inactivated by plasma esterase , primarily plasma cholinesterase . 
 therefore , they are always associated with low potency , slow onset , and short therapeutic duration.2 amino amide las became popular and many of this class of drugs were developed by 1970s . 
 amide - based las are degraded by hepatic endoplasmic reticulum , leading to a slower removal from the body and higher concentration in the plasma . with the introduction of bupivacaine , 
 accidental overdose was often fatal and responded poorly to conventional resuscitation.2,3 this had led to a search for long - acting las with improved therapeutic margins and reduced toxicity . 
 trachez et al and zapata - sudo et al demonstrated that s( ) enantiomer of bupivacine is more potent4 and less toxic5 than r(+ ) enantiomer leading to the selection of s( ) enantiomers of ropivacine and levobupivacine as safer alternatives to bupivacine . 
 high toxicity of la due to over dosage and strong clinical requirements have triggered the interest in the field on controlled release of la . 
 one of the primary objectives in the design of a controlled release system is the controlled delivery of therapeutics to the site with an optimal release rate . from here , two major areas have evolved : ( 1 ) design of good carriers to protect and deliver the therapeutics to the site of action and ( 2 ) development of a sustained drug formulation for a slow and long lasting effect.6 the release of these drugs will be controlled by desorption , diffusion , erosion , or a combination of these factors.7 one approach to prolong the effect of analgesia is to complex the la with drug delivery vehicles . 
 the larger carriers will remain at the injection site for a longer period of time with a gradual release of the la . 
 liposomes,811 cyclodextrins,12 microspheres,1315 hydrogels,16 and nanospheres6,1720 could encapsulate the la for controlled delivery , prolonged anesthetic effect , and reduced toxicity . from these various types of controlled delivery systems , depending on the end - use requirements , the most popular choice is nanospheres followed by microspheres and hydrogels.21 in this review , different methods of nanogel synthesis and an overview of drug release from nanogel - based delivery vehicles will be described and discussed . 
 current approaches used for the preparation of nanogels can be classified into four categories : ( 1 ) polymerization of monomers in a homogeneous phase or in a microscale or nanoscale heterogeneous environment ; ( 2 ) physical self - assembly of interactive polymers ; ( 3 ) cross - linking of preformed polymers ; and ( 4 ) template - assisted nanofabrication of nanogel particles . in this section 
 , we will discuss these methods , where the synthesis technique being employed is typically dictated by the desired application and types of study being performed . 
 surfactant - free emulsion polymerization or precipitation polymerization is a versatile technique for synthesizing stimuli - responsive nanogels . 
 nanogels synthesized by this method are formed by homogeneous nucleation of water - soluble monomers , which results in the formation of a colloidal suspension of the growing polymer , and the charge imparted by the initiator stabilizes the gels . 
 this method is versatile from the standpoint of particle size control . to synthesize smaller nanogels , 
 the precursor particles must be stabilized earlier in the reaction , where an ionic surfactant can be added to impart colloidal stability . 
 similarly , larger particles can be obtained by decreasing the surfactant concentration.22 peppas and coworkers23 synthesized a suspension of nanospheres composed of poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( peg)-grafted poly ( methacrylic acid ) ( pma ) in water using the precipitation polymerization method . 
 thermoresponsive poly ( n - isopropylacrylamide ) ( pnipam ) nanogels with narrow size distribution were first synthesized by pelton and chibante,24,25 where all the monomers and cross - linker are dissolved in water . 
 precipitation polymerization is best for materials that are hydrophobic , so that they can readily attach to the collapsed precursor particle and is useful only for materials that are stable at high temperatures , and hence it can not be used to incorporate biological macromolecules . 
 thus , if a hydrophilic comonomer is to be copolymerized , only a certain weight percentage can be incorporated.22 to overcome these drawbacks , inverse microemulsion polymerization is used , where an aqueous solution of all the monomers is added to an appropriate amount of oil and surfactant to produce a thermodynamically stable microemulsion . 
 various drugs , dna , and cells are physically incorporated into these aqueous microemulsions , which are then cross - linked with appropriate cross - linking agents . 
 the resulting cross - linked nanogels are prepared by dispersion in organic solvents , and then purified by precipitation , centrifugation , washing ( usually with organic solvents , such as isopropanol ) , and lyophilization . 
 several reports have demonstrated the synthesis of hydrophilic or water - soluble particles comprising of poly ( 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate ) ( phema),26 polyacrylic acid ( paa),27 polyacrylamide ( paam),26 pnipam,2830 and polyaniline.31 these nanoparticles can be either hollow and zwitterionic or core 
 labile bonds are frequently introduced into the nanogels during polymerization to make them degradable and facilitate drug release.3236 matyjaszewski and coworkers35,36 used the atom transfer radical polymerization ( atrp ) performed in an inverse microemulsion system to synthesize stable biodegradable nanogels comprising of water - soluble polymers with a disulfide - functionalized cross - linker . 
 nanogels can also be formed using the physical self - assembly of polymers involving a mixture of amphiphilic copolymer and a therapeutic agent in an organic solvent via membrane dialysis or from direct complexation between cationic copolymers and genes or proteins in an aqueous solution through noncovalent interactions , such as van der waals , hydrogen bonding , stereocomplexation , charge transfer , and polyelectrolyte complexation . during the self - assembly process 
 , small molecular drugs and macromolecular therapeutics , such as genes and proteins , can be incorporated into the micellar nanostructures . 
 the most widely used selfassociating polymers are amphiphilic block copolymers that possess hydrophobic and hydrophilic blocks that can self - assemble in selective solvents to form submicron - size micelles ( nanogels ) . 
 these amphiphilic polymers can be synthesized via living radical polymerization ( lrp ) techniques ( eg , atrp , reversible addition  fragmentation chain transfer [ raft ] , and nitroxide - mediated polymerization [ nmp ] ) . 
 the micellization of amphiphilic block copolymers can be tailored by changing the block nature , block lengths , composition , or architecture.3739 in addition , external parameters , ie , change in temperature or solvent or addition of additives , such as electrolytes and cosolvents , provide extra degrees of freedom to tune the micellar behavior of the amphiphilic block copolymers.4044 moreover , the chemistry of the surface can be manipulated for the conjugation of a targeting signal that can recognize specific tissues or cells . 
 the functionalities of the core of nanogels can be tuned using specific chemical approaches to improve the drug - loading capacity . 
 the molecular compositions of the copolymers used to form the nanogels can be controlled through lrp approaches to achieve nanostructures with narrow size distribution . 
 in addition to the above two polymerization methods , covalent cross - linking of preformed polymer chains provides excellent opportunities for producing functional nanogels with large pore sizes for drug delivery.45 in particular , it was used to synthesize the first cross - linked cationic nanogel for polynucleotide delivery.46 in this case , a doubly activated peg was conjugated to a branched polyethylenimine ( pei ) in an oil in water emulsion ( dichloromethane in water ) followed by evaporation of the solvent in vacuo and maturation of the nanogel in an aqueous solution . 
 cationic pei containing nanogels of 80200 nm diameter were also obtained by the photo - fenton reaction in aqueous media.47,48 small ( 4045 nm ) , nontoxic cross - linked pullulan nanogels were prepared in the reverse micellar system ( aerosol ot / hexane).49,50 the cross - links that connect the polymeric chains in such nanogels can be made degradable to reduce their toxicity . 
 for example , a biodegradable segmented pei connected by disulfide linkers was used to prepare cationic nanogels for polynucleotide delivery,51 and hyaluronic acid ( ha ) nanogels containing biodegradable disulfide linkages were prepared by the inverse water in oil emulsion method.52 an interesting type of cross - linked nanogels containing dna was obtained by mixing thiol - functionalized 6-arm - branched peg and dna in dimethyl sulfoxide , which produced particles of 100 nm diameter and subsequently cross - linked by oxidation to obtain dna - loaded biodegradable nanogels.53 combining the controlled self - assembly of polymeric micelles and cross - linking techniques provided opportunities for the control of the spatial distribution of polymeric chains at the nanolength scale . for example , 
 wooley and coworkers5458 have chemically cross - linked the shell layers of polymeric micelles to obtain various shell - cross - linked nanoparticles with morphologies , such as spheres , rods , and even toroids . in another study , pei was cross - linked to micelles of doubly activated pluronic triblock copolymer in aqueous solution to produce nanogels with a hydrophobic poly ( p - phenylene oxide ) ( ppo ) core surrounded by a swollen cross - linked pei and a peg shell.59 lee et al60 photo - cross - linked the polymeric micelles of poly(d , l - lactic acid)-b - peg - b - poly(d , l - lactic acid ) with acrylate end groups , resulting in the formation of nanogels containing self - assembled hydrophobic domains of micelles with insoluble poly(d , l - lactic acid ) cores , which could be loaded with a hydrophobic anticancer drug . 
 finally , desimone and coworkers61 developed a novel imprint photolithographic technique , particle replication in nonwetting templates ( print ) , for the fabrication of nanogels . 
 they used nonwetting elastomeric molds of a low - surface - energy perfluoropolyether network prepared on patterned silicon templates by photochemical cross - linking of dimethacrylate - functionalized perfluoropolyether oligomers . 
 the nonwetting molds eliminate the formation of a residual interconnecting film between the molded objects , thus producing monodispersed , shape - specific nanoparticles from an extensive array of organic precursors . 
 this method enables strict control over the particle size , shape , composition , and surface functionality and permits the loading of delicate cargos , including pharmaceutical drugs and biomacromolecules . 
 for example , monodispersed 200-nm - diameter peg - based swellable particles were fabricated with the print method by uv - induced copolymerization of several vinyl monomers , such as peg triacrylate , peg monomethyl ether monomethacrylate , and p - hydroxystyrene.62 
 parenteral route is the only approach to administer drugs , as this will ensure the quickest onset of the therapeutic product . from the work of lee 
 et al,63 injections made with nanogels are less painful when compared with cosolvent - based formulation . 
 high blood circulation time could be achieved due to the size of the nanogels , which is very important to extend the therapeutic efficacy of the la . 
 nanogels exhibit excellent thermodynamic stability , high solubilization capacity , low viscosity , and ability to withstand sterilization techniques , and these properties make nanogels as interesting delivery systems.64 most importantly , after the encapsulation of la into the nanospheres , the toxicity effect is greatly reduced as shown by the work of moraes et al using poly(dl - lactide - co - glycolide ) nanospheres encapsulated with either bupivacaine17 or ropivacaine.18 in both the cases , after encapsulation of the la , there was a significant improvement in the viability of 3t3 cells ( figure 2 ) . 
 there are 2 goals that should be satisfied in the design of a delivery system:65 ( 1 ) efficient binding of drugs to the polymeric matrix and release of the drugs in a controlled manner and ( 2 ) ability to release through a local or externally applied trigger by changing the binding affinity between the drug and the polymeric matrix . 
 since most of the las possess secondary or tertiary amines , electrostatic interaction is the dominant driving force , depending on the ph of the solution and pka of the la . 
 therefore , a clear understanding on the interaction between the la and the nanogel is critical for the development of an efficient drug delivery system . 
 procaine hydrochloride ( prhy ; a la drug of the amino ester group ) loaded into methacrylic acid  ethyl acrylate ( maa  ea ) nanogels through hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding ( figure 3 ) showed a higher release at a higher ph ( figure 4).66 at a higher ph , the acid on the nanogels will be deprotonated , thus increasing the osmotic pressure and swelling the nanogels . 
 this will promote the release of prhy through the increase in porosity.20 different kinds of interactions will result in a different release profile , which will be important for the design of a delivery carrier , where drug release can be triggered by changing the ph . 
 first , the results demonstrated the viability of tuning the release profiles of drug from a ph - responsive nanogel system . 
 the proportion of drug released can be controlled by manipulating the ph of the environment . 
 hence , it is possible to design a ph - dependent gradient release drug delivery system , such that the active drugs could be released from the carrier in different regions of the physiological environment that possess different ph conditions . 
 this will extend the therapeutic range of active drugs and ensure that the targeted areas receive the right dosage of drugs . 
 second , the interaction between the drug and delivery carriers controls the release profiles and the effective therapeutic range of drug carriers . 
 therefore , it is possible to design a drug delivery system with enhanced interaction in order to have a better control of release behavior.20 histological studies showed that particles with a size of 100 nm could diffuse through the submucosal layers , whereas larger - sized particles ( 500 nm10 m ) were found to concentrate within the epithelial tissue linings.67 due to the high surface area - to - volume ratio , the release of hydrophilic la will be rapid , that is indicated by the initial burst release . 
 high initial burst release has been observed for poly(dl - lactide - co - glycolide ) nanopaticles,19,68 chitosan nanoparticles,69 and pnipam - co - acrylic acid hydrogels in the submicron range.70 a simple approach in addressing the problem of initial burst of nanogels was proposed by our group using the layer - by - layer ( lbl ) technique.71 lbl is a simple technique of coating alternating layers of oppositely charged polyelectrolyte onto a surface . 
 however , the coating must not be too stable , as this will impact the effectiveness of the coated particles as a vehicle for drug delivery . 
 permeability will be reduced if the coating is too stable , resulting in a continuous slow release of the drugs.71 with more polyelectrolyte layers , the more accessible prhy molecules have to diffuse through the polyethylene ( pe ) layers , therefore mitigating the burst release phenomenon ( figure 5).71 from the work of grner et al,6 it is shown that size and drug loading do have an effect on the mass of drugs released per milligram of nanospheres and the time to attain equilibrium release . 
 larger particles will result in higher mass of drugs released and longer time to achieve equilibrium . 
 tan et al66 have also shown that with a higher drug loading content of prhy , the rate and amount of drugs released will be greatly affected ( figure 6 ) . as a result 
 , we have learned that the drug release rate of the encapsulated drugs is highly dependent on the state ( crystalline or dispersed ) .

 the use of la could be limited by the relatively short therapeutic action and systemic toxicity related to high drug plasma concentration as a result of fast systemic uptake .

"a 7-year - old spayed domestic longhair cat from perth , western australia , presented with left - sided head tilt , dysphonia , head shaking , inappetence and weight loss . 
 otitis media with extension into the external ear canal was suspected and investigated using video - otoscopy and computed tomography examination . 
 invasive disease with extension from the middle ear to the base of the skull , and intracranial extension into the caudal fossa and cranial cervical vertebral canal was detected . 
 cytology of external ear canal exudate showed capsulated budding yeasts and cryptococcus gattii vgii was cultured . 
 treatment with amphotericin b infusions and oral fluconazole was prescribed , with nutritional support via oesophagostomy tube . 
 this case report describes the successful medical treatment of otogenic meningoencephalomyelitis due to c gattii ( vgii ) infection in a cat . 
 cryptococcosis is a common systemic mycosis affecting cats worldwide and can affect cats of any age and sex . 
 the two most common species causing disease in animals are cryptococcus neoformans and cryptococcus gattii . 
 historically , cryptococcus was classified into five serotypes ( a , b , c , d and ad ) on the basis of antigenic differences in capsular polysaccharides . using a modern molecular typing scheme , 
 cryptococcal strains are now divided into eight multilocus sequence types ( vni , vnii , vniii , vniv , vgi , vgii , vgiii , vgiv ) , which are likely to be cryptic species . 
 c gattii has been associated with tropical and subtropical climates , with an outbreak of disease affecting both humans and animals in the pacific northwest of the usa , emanating from an initial focus of infection on vancouver island , british columbia , canada . 
 c gattii primarily infects immunocompetent hosts and the organism can cause disease in unusual host species ( eg , horses , ferrets , goats , dolphins ) . 
 vgii has a high environmental presence in perth , western australia , and areas of the northern territory , in contrast to eastern australia where vgi isolates predominate . 
 the genetic diversity of vgii environmental and clinical isolates obtained from the perth environs suggests there is a sexually recombining population structure in this geographical niche . while c gattii vgi is strongly associated with detritus in mature eucalyptus tree hollows , the ecological niche of vgii is largely unknown . in vancouver island , where an outbreak of vgiia was diagnosed in humans and animals , c gattii vgii colonises coniferous , evergreen and deciduous trees in the douglas fir tree bioclimatic zone , with transient isolation from soil , saltwater , freshwater and air . 
 infection most likely occurs subsequent to inhalation of airborne infectious propagules such as basidiospores or desiccated yeast cells with clinical signs of sneezing , stertor , nasal deformity and discharge reflecting nasal cavity infection . 
 it is common for the infection to spread , both locally to contiguous adjacent structures and haematogenously to other sites . 
 we present an unusual case of otogenic infection with intracranial extension attributable to c gattii vgiib in a cat for which signs resolved with aggressive medical therapy . 
 a 7-year - old spayed domestic longhair cat was presented to murdoch university veterinary hospital for evaluation of left head tilt , dysphonia , head shaking , inappetance and weight loss of 2 weeks duration . 
 initial investigations by the referring veterinarian identified an aural mass in the left horizontal ear canal , which had been removed . 
 sabouraud s dextrose agar culture of an ear swab had resulted in heavy growth of c gattii . 
 serum latex cryptococcal antigen agglutination test ( lcat ) was positive , with a titre of 1:256 . 
 the cat was treated with enrofloxacin ( 5 mg / kg po q24h [ baytril ; bayer animal health ] ) , itraconazole ( 10 mg / kg po q24h [ sporanox ; janssen pharmaceutica ] ) , meloxicam ( 0.05 mg / kg po q24h [ meloxicam ; troy laboratories australia ] ) and a topical compounded enrofloxacin / dexamethasone otic preparation . 
 the cat was thin ( body condition score [ bcs ] 3/9 ; weight 4.9 kg ) and had a left - sided head tilt . 
 the remainder of the clinical examination , including full ophthalmic and neurological examinations , was unremarkable . 
 the presence of a head tilt without ipsilateral postural reaction deficits was consistent with left peripheral vestibular disease . 
 hand - held otoscopic examination demonstrated a mass occluding the lumen of the left horizontal ear canal , and ceruminous discharge . 
 the cat was premedicated with buprenorphine ( 0.018 mg / kg i m [ temgesic ; symbion pharmacy services ] ) and acepromazine ( 0.04 mg / kg i m [ acp ; westralian holdings ] ) , anaesthetised with propofol and maintained with isoflurane in 100% oxygen . 
 a ct ( siemens emotion duo 2 slice ct scanner ; ge healthcare australia ) examination of the head was performed using soft tissue and bone spatial reconstruction algorithm and 1 mm slice thickness pre- and postintravenous contrast ( iohexol ; 10 ml [ 300 mmol / l ] iv ) ( figure 1 ) , followed by video - otoscopic examination . 
 ( a ) the medial portion of the left external ear canal is filled with strongly and homogeneously contrast - enhancing soft tissue attenuating material ( 1 ) . 
 the left tympanic bulla is filled with mildly and homogeneously contrast - enhancing material ( 3 ) . 
 ( b ) the material seen ventromedial to the tympanic bulla continues caudally and forms a 1.6 cm ( width )  1.3 cm ( height )  2.5 cm ( length ) soft tissue structure , poorly enhancing centrally but strongly enhancing peripherally ( 1 ) . 
 this mass ( * ) distorts local tissue architecture such that the nasopharyngeal lumen is narrowed > 50% , and the hyoid bones are displaced laterally . 
 additionally , at this level , there is a rim of contrast enhancement seen in the ventral aspect of the left temporal lobe of the cerebrum ( 2 ) . 
 ( c ) at the level of the caudal aspect of the left tympanic bulla , the soft tissue lesion can still be seen ventromedial to the bulla ( 1 ) . 
 additionally , there is a rim of contrast enhancement outlining a hypoattenuating area in the left lateral cerebellum ( 2 ) . 
 there is poorly contrast - enhancing soft tissue attenuating material in the caudal fossa that is displacing the brainstem dorsally and to the right ( 3 ) . additionally , there is strong meningeal contrast enhancement in this region . 
 ( d ) the poorly contrast - enhancing material in the cranial cavity can be followed further caudally , to the level of the atlas . 
 this image , at the level of the foramen magnum , demonstrates abnormal tissue ( arrow ) displacing and compressing the cervical spinal cord ( * ) dorsally and to the right . 
 ( e ) bone window computed tomography image at the most caudal aspect of the bulla . 
 note the discontinuity of the temporal bone ( black arrows ) , indicative of bony lysis ct showed moderate contrast enhancement of the left ear canal lining . 
 the medial portion of the left external ear canal and left tympanic bulla were filled with homogenous , contrast - enhancing soft tissue attenuating material ( figure 1a ) . 
 ventromedial and rostral to the tympanic bulla , a region ( 1.6 cm width  1.3 cm height  2.5 cm length ) of poorly contrast - enhancing tissue , outlined by a rim of strong contrast enhancement ( figure 1b ) causing a mass effect , was seen , which compressed the nasopharyngeal lumen by > 50% and displaced the hyoid bones laterally ( figure 1b ) . 
 ventromedial and caudal to the bulla , a similarly enhancing region was seen ( 0.6 cm height  0.3 cm width  0.6 cm length ) . in the caudal left bulla , there was bony lysis of the temporal bone ( figure 1e ) . 
 lateral to the oval foramen and dorsal to the larger parapharyngeal lesion , an intracranial rim of contrast enhancement was seen in the ventral aspect of the left temporal lobe . 
 adjacent to the lytic region of the temporal bone , contrast enhancement outlining a hypoattenuating area with broad dural base was seen ( figure 1c ) . poorly enhancing material extended caudally along the left ventral portion of the brainstem to mid first cervical vertebra , displacing and compressing the brainstem and cranial spinal cord , accompanied by strong meningeal contrast enhancement ( figure 1d ) . 
 video otoscopy ( medrx video otoscope ) identified a large pink fleshy mass obscuring the lumen of the horizontal ear canal . 
 the mass traversed the tympanic membrane , and was contiguous the tympanic bulla ( figure 2 ) , in agreement with ct findings . 
 video - otoscopic photograph of the left tympanic membrane , which appears to have been breached by abnormal inflammatory tissue ( arrows ) , which extends into the tympanic bulla impression smears of the mass revealed large numbers of round yeast , surrounded by a prominent clear halo and narrow - necked budding consistent with cryptococcal infection . 
 a heavy pure growth of a cryptococcus species resulted , which was identified as c gattii by conventional phenotypic mycology testing . 
 further analysis by sequencing of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region identified c gattii vgii by comparing the sequence with published signature sequences ; however , the isolate was not available for further molecular typing . 
 the isolate was susceptible to fluconazole , itraconazole , posaconazole , flucytosine and amphotericin b , but resistant to caspofungin . 
 the minimum inhibitory concentration ( mic ) for fluconazole was 8 mg / l ( table 1 ) . 
 antifungal susceptibility data for the cryptococcus gattii vgii isolate cultured from the cat s = susceptible ; r = resistant ; mic = minimum inhibitory concentration antifungal therapy was commenced with fluconazole ( 10 mg / kg po q12h [ symbion pharmacy services ] ) and amphotericin deoxycholate ( 0.5 mg / kg ; subcutaneous infusion in 350 ml 0.45% nacl and 2.5% dextrose three times weekly ) . 
 four weeks after treatment commenced , the cat was brighter , with complete resolution of the head tilt , although inappetence persisted . 
 , the cat had received a cumulative amphotericin b dose of 12.5 mg / kg , and was starting to eat and gain weight . owing to finances , 
 the frequency of amphotericin b infusion was reduced to twice weekly ( dose 0.7 mg / kg / infusion ) . 
 the frequency of amphotericin b infusion was reduced to once weekly ( 0.7 mg / kg / infusion ) . 
 four months after diagnosis , lcat was 1:256 and the plasma concentration of fluconazole was 45 mg / l . 
 seven months after diagnosis , the lcat was 1:64 and was 1:32 a further 3 months later , with a corresponding plasma concentration of fluconazole of 47 mg / l . 
 after 12 months , the weekly amphotericin b infusions ( 0.7 mg / kg ) were discontinued and the cat continued to be clinically well , receiving only fluconazole ( 50 mg q12h ) . at the time of writing , 21 months after starting therapy , the lcat was 1:8 and the cat continued to be clinically well . 
 otitis media due to c neoformans var grubii infection was managed by a total ear canal ablation and lateral bulla osteotomy , followed by oral itraconazole . in the third cat ventral bulla osteotomy and twice weekly amphotericin b subcutaneous infusions , with oral flucytosine and fluconazole , were used . in these latter two cats , 
 diagnosis was made on cytological and histological evaluation of material removed via bulla osteotomy , culture and serum antigen testing . 
 the cat presented initially with unilateral peripheral vestibular disease . as a mass in the left external ear canal 
 was detected during preliminary examination , an aural polyp arising from the middle ear was initially suspected . 
 presence of additional signs , including dysphonia , inappetence and weight loss , may have suggested a more sinister underlying aetiology . 
 cytology from the external ear canal resulted in a prompt diagnosis of cryptococcosis ; however , failure to improve clinically to azole monotherapy prompted referral . 
 video otoscopy and ct of the head demonstrated extensive and invasive disease of the ear , skull , cervical spinal cord and ipsilateral intracranial dural space . 
 inhalation of air - borne basidiospores or desiccated yeast cells into the nasal cavity is considered the primary route of infection in cats . 
 colonisation of the caudal nasal cavity , with subsequent epithelial invasion , possibly in the vicinity of the nasopharynx , may have been the primary route of infection , with extension via the auditory tube to the middle ear . 
 possible pathways from the inner ear into the brainstem include erosion through the medial aspect of the petrous temporal bone ( although this was not apparent in the ct scans ) , along the nerves and vessels of the internal acoustic meatus , or via haematogenous spread . 
 inoculation of cryptococcal organisms directly into the external ear canal , with subsequent spread to the middle ear by penetration of the tympanic membrane is considered unlikely and usually results in only superficial lesions . 
 a grass seed heavily contaminated with cryptococcal cells may provide an explanation for how this might have occurred , although these are less commonly found in the ear canal of cats than dogs . 
 this case is quite distinct from a recent feline case of bilateral cryptococcal otitis interna , which was thought to have arisen haematogenously as there was no evidence of rhinosinusitis disease or otitis media , and a small cryptococcal lesion was also present in the thalamus ; this patient was infected with c neoformans var grubii . 
 the pathogenesis of cryptococcus in this cat is unusual and supports the contention by sykes and malik that vgii and vgiii infections are more invasive than c gattii vgi and c neoformans var grubii infections . 
 all clinical signs resolved after aggressive medical therapy and initial de - bulking within the ear canal . while recent papers concerning c gattii vgi infections of the nasal cavity and contiguous tissues in koalas have emphasised the need for surgical intervention and/or intralesional therapy because antifungal agents may not penetrate well into poorly perfused tissues , the requirement for this probably should be made on a case - by - case basis . 
 c gattii vgii can be divided into vgiia , vgiib and vgiic strains , with vgiia being the major genotype in the vancouver island outbreak . 
 determining the specific biotype is critical because c gattii vgii and vgiii isolates tend to demonstrate heteroresistance to fluconazole . 
 the epidemiological cut - off values for fluconazole in vgii and vgiii infections are therefore higher than for vgi and c neoformans var grubii isolates . in this instance 
 the causal vgii isolate was susceptible to fluconazole in vitro , with a mic of 8 mg / l . given the pharmacokinetics of fluconazole in the cat , a dose of 10 mg / kg po q12h should produce peak blood concentrations of fluconazole at steady state in the order of 2080 mg / l . in eastern australia , about 20% of cryptococcosis in cats and dogs is caused by c gattii ( predominantly vgi ) . in western australia , vgiib ( mating type  ) is the predominant species of c gattii , although vgi and vgii ( mating type a ) also occur . 
 studies on the c gattii vgiia isolates from the vancouver island outbreak and vgiib isolates from australia have demonstrated that such strains are highly virulent in experimental infections of mice and rats . 
 although central nervous system ( cns ) involvement is an important negative prognostic indicator in feline cryptococcosis , this cat improved markedly with combination therapy using amphotericin b and fluconazole . 
 cross - sectional imaging was not often undertaken when cases of cryptococcosis were first recorded in the veterinary literature . in this case , 
 clinical findings and plain radiographs would not have provided indication of the extensiveness of the disease , and the success of medical therapy in this cat testifies that good outcomes may occur despite extensive invasive disease . 
 treatment for cns cryptococcosis is prolonged and should be continued until the lcat titre reaches zero , which may take 12 years . in recovered cats , 
 the titre can be monitored every 36 months to allow early detection of recurrences , which is more common than re - infection with a new strain or antifungal resistance .

"united states healthcare costs continue to escalate with no immediate relief in sight . in 2005 , 
 healthcare spending totaled us$2.0 trillion16% of the gross domestic product ( gdp ) ( poisal et al 2007 ) . 
 further , healthcare spending is projected to account for 18.4% of gdp by 2013 , when more than one out of every four dollars of personal consumption will be spent on healthcare ( heffler et al 2004 ) . 
 the aging of americans is a central component fueling cost increases . in the year 2000 , 12.4% of americans were over age 65 , but this will increase to 19.6% in 2030 ( goulding et al 2003 ) . 
 chronic diseases , especially prevalent in the senior population , generate a large proportion of medicare spending . in 19951999 ( the most recent data ) , only 5% of medicare beneficiaries , presumably many with chronic diseases , accounted for almost half ( 47% ) of total spending . a much larger segment of the population ( 40% ) , those in relatively good health , accounted for only 1% of the total ( liberman et al 2003 ) . preventing or postponing the onset of chronic disease among seniors has become a crucial public health issue , as has the potential to compress the period of morbidity prior to death ( vita et al 1998 ) . it has been estimated that approximately 70% of the total burden of disease ( as measured in terms of premature deaths and potential years of life lost ) can be traced back to illnesses that are preventable ( department of health and human services 1991 ) . 
 particularly noteworthy is research by mcginnis and foege ( 1993 ) and mokdad and colleagues ( 2004 ) who concluded that about half of all deaths in the us are caused by modifiable risk factors . 
 although death is inevitable , it is now becoming clear that successful health promotion programs can improve health , prevent much disability , delay mortality , and thereby substantially improve the quality of seniors lives ( aldana 2001 ; chernoff 2001 ) . 
 the growing awareness of the value of prevention and health promotion is evident at the executive branch of government . 
 the president launched the healthierus initiative , promoting healthier lifestyles and a reduction of risk factors such as inactivity , obesity , and smoking ( healthierus 2003 ) . 
 the rationale for this initiative , especially in relation to health promotion efforts directed at seniors , is described on the white house website : 
  poor health should not be a foregone consequence of aging . 
 improvements in diet and physical activity can greatly improve the quality of life at any age . 
 regular physical activity also helps older americans maintain joint strength and mobility and substantially delays the onset of functional limitations and loss of independence . 
 improvements in diet and physical activity can greatly improve the quality of life at any age . 
 regular physical activity also helps older americans maintain joint strength and mobility and substantially delays the onset of functional limitations and loss of independence . 
 the rapidly rising cost of healthcare , an aging population , and the high prevalence of chronic disease among the elderly generate a sense of urgency for finding innovative solutions to this country s healthcare crisis , including health promotion and disease prevention initiatives . in this paper , we highlight several key studies that underscore the value of introducing health promotion and risk reduction programs directed at seniors . 
 furthermore , we present evidence suggesting that health promotion and risk reduction programs may reduce unnecessary healthcare utilization and related expenditures for the medicare program , yielding a favorable return - on - investment ( roi ) for such interventions . 
 we finish our discussion with a description of an innovative demonstration project that centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) will be introducing in 2007 to test whether health promotion programs can improve the health of seniors and also achieve a positive cost - benefit ratio . 
 a growing literature presents convincing evidence that seniors who reduce their modifiable health risks can forestall disability , reduce their utilization of health services , and ultimately save medicare money ( hickey et al 1997 ; king et al 1998 ; vita et al 1998 ; fries 2002 ; omenn 2003 ) . lubitz and colleagues ( 2003 ) presented evidence that elderly persons in better health at age 70 live about 2.7 years longer than those in poor health , and their cumulative medicare healthcare expenditures are no greater than those who die earlier ; in fact , they may be slightly lower . 
 the macarthur study on aging , consisting of dozens of studies conducted over a decade , helped researchers identify components of successful aging ( seeman et al 2001 ) . 
 for example , quitting smoking and initiating other lifestyle changes even later in life have produced substantial health benefits ( hickey et al 1997 ; hermanson et al 1988 ) . 
 importantly , several studies confirm the value of physical activity for improving health among the elderly ( king 2001 ) . 
 physical activity can extend life , help prevent heart disease and colon cancer , ( christmas and andersen 2001 ; penedo et al 2004 ) mitigate the effects of chronic diseases such as arthritis or diabetes ( christmas and andersen 2001 ; bean et al 2004 ) , improve coordination and flexibility to help avoid falls ( christmas and andersen 2001 ; bean et al 2004 ) , and alleviate depression among older adults ( christmas and andersen 2001 ) . 
 adults who practice even simple physical activity can improve their health status and use fewer health and social services ( aldana 2001 ) . to emphasize the importance of physical activity , a comprehensive review by himes ( 2002 ) identified these two overriding determinants of health status for seniors : social isolation as a strongly negative influence and regular physical activity as a strongly positive factor . 
 in the private sector , evidence suggests that multicomponent health promotion and risk reduction programs can permanently change lifestyle habits and reduce population health risks for nonseniors ( heaney and goetzel 1997 ) . 
 a report by rand ( 2001 ) concluded that successful risk reduction programs directed at working and senior populations share certain characteristics that make them effective in changing life - long health habits . 
 successful programs are anchored in behavior change theory , employ tailored and personalized interventions , are sufficiently intensive , and are complemented by adequate social supports . 
 such programs appear to work effectively even if they are not delivered face - to - face , but instead provided by telephone , internet , and mail . in addition , health promotion programs that engage participants in self - care activities and increase their involvement in healthcare decision - making can achieve long - term behavior change and risk reductions ( heaney and goetzel 1997 ) . although much of this private sector research has been conducted with those under age 65 , the underlying principles and methods employed by these programs possess sufficient flexibility to be tailored to the unique needs of diverse populations , suggesting that risk reduction programs targeting seniors have a high potential to achieve lasting behavior changes and potentially lower utilization of healthcare services ( rand 2001 ) . 
 other research in the private sector is pointing in the direction that evidence - based health promotion and risk reduction programs can save money . 
 several literature reviews that weighed the evidence from experimental and quasi - experimental research studies suggest that programs grounded in behavior change theory and that utilize tailored communications and individualized counseling for high - risk individuals produce a positive roi ( goetzel et al 1999 ; aldana 2001 ; us department of health and human services 2003 ) . 
 much of the roi research has emerged from employer - sponsored health promotion programs directed at active employees ( goetzel et al 1999 ; pelletier 2001 ) . in a review of 32 health promotion program evaluations , aldana ( 2001 ) found 28 studies that reported medical cost savings . 
 of the seven studies that calculated cost - benefit ratios , financial returns averaged $ 3.48 for every dollar expended . studies often cited with the strongest research designs and large numbers of subjects included those performed at johnson and johnson ( bly et al 1986 ; breslow et al 1994 ) , citibank ( ozminkowski et al 1999 ) , dupont ( bertera 1990 ) , the bank of america ( leigh et al 1992 ; fries et al 1993 ) , tenneco ( baun et al 1986 ) , duke university ( knight et al 1994 ) , the california public employee retirees system ( calpers ) ( fries et al 1994 ) , procter and gamble ( goetzel , jacobsen , et al 1998 ) , and chevron corporation ( goetzel , dunn , et al 1998 ) . even accounting for certain inconsistencies in design and results , most produced positive cost outcomes . 
 the most recent review on this topic conducted by chapman ( 2003 ) , summarizing the results from 42 qualifying financial impact studies conducted over the past two decades , concluded that worksite programs achieve a 25%30% reduction in medical and absenteeism costs in an average period of about 3.6 years ( goetzel , jacobsen , et al 1998 ) . 
 similarly , the rand report ( 2001 ) concluded that health promotion and risk reduction programs using health risk assessments ( hras ) and ongoing tailored interventions have the potential to be cost - beneficial . 
 five financial analyses are especially pertinent to cost - benefit calculations for medicare enrollees engaged in health promotion programs : four ( fries et al 1993 ; fries et al 1994 ; fries and mcshane 1998 ; ozminkowski et al 2006 ) focused on risk reduction programs for seniors ( at the bank of america , calpers , and at general motors corporation ) , and one for working - age individuals at citibank ( ozminkowski et al 1999 ) . employing available medical claims data to estimate changes in medical expenditures , 
 that roi estimate was similar to one obtained in a randomized trial using the same intervention program in a different population ( fries et al 1993 ) . 
 using methods that imputed changes in medical expenditures from changes in utilization , the evaluations of bank of america and calpers programs for seniors reported rois of approximately $ 5.00 to $ 1.00 . 
 the general motors study was not an roi study , because it contained no program cost information . 
 however , it did demonstrate that health promotion programs offered to seniors , particularly those that are based upon administering a health risk appraisal , can save $ 101 to $ 648 per person per year ( at the us dollar value for 2006 ) , depending upon who participates and how many programs they use . 
 admittedly , the methodological rigor of evaluations performed at many corporate health promotion programs has not been consistent . 
 in fact , randomized trials are hard to find in the literature , largely because they are not well accepted in a business environment . 
 however , methodological shortcomings in earlier analyses have diminished significantly over the past two decades . 
 the most recent evaluations using sophisticated econometric methods that control for selection bias do assess impact over several years ( with some extending for three to five years and one , performed at johnson & johnson , lasting nine years ) ( ozminkowski et al 2002 ) . 
 these advances should inform future study designs of similar health promotion interventions directed at seniors . in short , a focus on prevention and health promotion offers a most promising approach to the urgent challenges that the medicare program faces today and into the future . 
 research in the private sector presents compelling evidence to warrant large scale federally funded demonstrations that test the prospect for well - designed health promotion and risk reduction efforts to pay for themselves through lower healthcare expenditures . 
 although some corporate studies have recently begun to focus on productivity impacts from these programs ( eg , reduced absenteeism , shortened disability periods , decreased  presenteeism  ) , much of the private sector research has emphasized healthcare cost savings . 
 this is the same focus of policy makers and legislators with oversight responsibility for medicare . 
 there are still several unanswered questions related to the application of health promotion and risk reduction programs in an elderly population . 
 for example , will living a healthy life truly reduce seniors illnesses and incidence of disability prior to their demise or will they simply live longer and their illnesses and disability be delayed ? thus , will a longer life span cost medicare more because seniors are alive longer and may still experience significant end - of - life illness and costs ? these are testable hypotheses . 
 while successful health promotion interventions could extend the period of healthy life and result in costs being incurred to the medicare program over a longer period of time , the alternatives are not appealing . 
 researchers at rand recently estimated the costs of the future obese elderly , and found that medicare will spend 35% more caring for an obese 70-year - old person over his or her lifetime than for a normal weight person , at a cost of $ 36,000 ( lakdawalla et al 2005 ) . to explore these very complex issues , in 2007 , 
 medicare will initiate a three and a half year research project entitled senior risk reduction demonstration ( srrd ) , to test the health and economic impacts of providing health promotion services , modeled after programs provided to those under age 65 . 
 the srrd will provide insights on how to deliver such programs practically , an important step in advancing the medicare program from one focused on the diseases of older people to one focused on improving their health and quality of life . 
 cms will offer risk reduction services to noninstitutionalized medicare beneficiaries between the ages of 67 and 74 , to be delivered by private sector vendors . 
 five vendors will be given contact information for a random sample of beneficiaries from across the us , as well as from communities that have exemplary information and referral / assistance ( i&r / a ) programs for seniors.voluntary participation .

 consequently , preventing or postponing disease onset among the elderly has become a crucial public health issue . 
 fortunately , much of the total burden of disease is attributable to conditions that are preventable . in this paper 
 , we address whether well - designed health promotion programs can prevent illness , reduce disability , and improve the quality of life . 
 furthermore , we assess evidence that these programs have the potential to reduce healthcare utilization and related expenditures for the medicare program . 
 we hypothesize that seniors who reduce their modifiable health risks can forestall disability , reduce healthcare utilization , and save medicare money . 
 we end with a discussion of a new senior risk reduction demonstration , which will be initiated by the centers for medicare and medicaid services in 2007 , to test whether risk reduction programs developed in the private sector can achieve health improvements among seniors and a positive return on investment for the medicare program ."
"optimal phosphate balance is important for many physiological functions from cell signaling to energy metabolism to skeletal mineralization . 
 inadequate phosphate balance disrupts a multitude of physiological processes , and can cause or exacerbate age - associated disorders , cardiovascular calcification and bone mineralization defects . 
 physiologic phosphate balance is maintained by interactions among the intestine , kidney , parathyroid gland and bone . 
 phosphate absorption takes place mostly in the small intestine , and the sodium - dependent phosphate ( napi ) co - transporter , napi-2b , facilitates such absorption . of relevance , 
 the intestinal napi-2b activity is influenced by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d , which can increase the expression of intestinal napi-2b protein to augment intestinal phosphate uptake by the enterocytes . 
 likewise , renal phosphate reabsorption is mostly accomplished by the napi-2a and napi-2c co - transporters . 
 parathyroid hormone ( pth ) increases urinary phosphate excretion by reducing napi - dependent phosphate uptake in the proximal tubular epithelial cells . 
 recent studies have shown that bone - derived fibroblast growth factor 23 ( fgf23 ) and kidney - derived klotho can also directly suppress sodium phosphate co - transporter activities . 
 in addition to intestine and kidney , bone also plays a major role in maintaining phosphate balance . when serum phosphate levels are low , the bone releases additional phosphate to maintain the homeostatic balance by increasing resorption , a process that is mostly influenced by the activity of pth and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d. pth alters receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa - b ligand - osteoprotegerin ( rankl / opg ) balance , by acting on the stromal cells to stimulate rankl expression , and also by reducing the expression of opg and vitamin d. on the other hand , pth stimulates osteoclast differentiation and activity , resulting in increased bone resorption . 
 furthermore , pth and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d can induce skeletal fgf23 production to regulate serum phosphate levels and thereby can influence bone resorption . 
 fgf23 is a 30 kda protein that is proteolytically processed to smaller n - terminal ( 18 kda ) and c - terminal tail ( 12 kda ) fragments . 
 structural analysis of fgf23 protein found a fgf receptor ( fgfr)-binding domain at the n - terminal and a potential klotho - interacting site at the c - terminal tail . 
 recent studies have shown that the c - terminal tail determines the functionality of fgf23 protein . 
 for instance , when the c - terminal tail of the fgf2 protein was replaced with the c - terminal tail of fgf23 , the chimeric protein containing the n - terminal of fgf2 and c - terminal tail of fgf23 could act as a phosphatonin , and could also reduce renal 1(oh ) synthesis . 
 it is worth mentioning that the presence of the c - terminal tail of fgf23 in the chimeric protein paved the way for the klotho interaction . 
 recently , family with sequence similarity 20 , member c ( fam20c ) has shown to phosphorylate fgf23 on a ser - x - glu motif , and such phosphorylation promotes fgf23 proteolysis by furin through blocking o - glycosylation by polypeptide n - acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 ( galnac - t3 ) . 
 this observation suggests that interplay between phosphorylation and o - glycosylation of fgf23 may be a critical posttranslational mechanism by which the activity of secreted fgf23 protein is determined 
 . once secreted as a bioactive protein , fgf23 , in presence of klotho , can induce downstream signaling molecules , as demonstrated by the activation of early growth response element-1 ( egr-1 ) and the phosphorylation of fgf receptor substrate-2a , extracellular signal - regulated kinase ( erk ) , p38 , jun n - terminal kinase ( jnk ) , and akt . 
 of relevance , these signaling phosphoproteins were detected only when cells were challenged with both fgf23 and klotho , and not in cells treated with fgf23 without klotho . in accord with these in vitro observations , in vivo studies have shown that bioactive fgf23 protein could significantly reduce serum phosphate level in wild - type and fgf23 knockout mice , but failed to exert such phosphate lowering effects in fgf23/klotho double knockout mice , again suggesting that without klotho , fgf23 loses its phosphate regulating abilities . 
 moreover , the fgf23-induced hypophosphatemic phenotype of hyp mutant mice was reversed to hyperphosphatemia in the hyp / klotho double mutant mice , despite significantly higher serum fgf23 levels in double mutants . in a similar line of observation , 
 an inactivating mutation in the human klotho gene resulted in severe hyperphosphatemia in a tumoral calcinosis patient , despite high serum fgf23 levels . 
 summarizing these above - mentioned observations , an indispensable role of klotho in fgf23-mediated urinary phosphate excretion is obvious . 
 one of the possible mechanisms of fgf23-induced urinary phosphate excretion is that it suppresses napi-2a and napi-2c co - transporters , either directly or through influencing pth activity . 
 pth , an 84 amino acid protein , is produced in response to low levels of serum calcium and secreted pth acts on the bone and kidney to increase serum calcium level . 
 low serum calcium levels reduce calcium - sensor receptor ( car ) signaling and allow active pth to be secreted , which then binds to the pth receptor 1 , a seven transmembrane g - protein coupled receptor , to activate the pka , pkc , and mapk pathways in kidney and bone . 
 in addition to serum calcium , vitamin d can also suppress pth expression and parathyroid hyperplasia . 
 it is believed that fgf23 and pth mutually regulate each other in a negative feedback loop , where pth stimulates fgf23 production and fgf23 in turn suppresses pth synthesis . 
 when pth was genetically ablated from fgf23 knockout mice , serum calcium levels were normalized in double mutant ( fgf23/pth ) mice , despite high serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d and high serum phosphate levels , suggesting that some of the biochemical changes documented in fgf23 mice are mediated by pth . 
 it is a well - known fact that continuous administration of pth for a prolonged period can reduce bone mass . 
 however , when fgf23 mice were challenged with constant pth infusion through osmotic minipumps for 3 weeks , pth - induced bone loss was more severe , suggesting that fgf23 might exert a protective effect against the long - term catabolic effects of pth on bone . in a mouse model of hyperparathyroidism , fgf23 levels positively correlated with those of pth , but inversely with serum phosphate levels . 
 presence of both klotho and fgf receptors in the parathyroid glands raised the possibility that parathyroid gland might be a target organ for fgf23 activities . using bovine parathyroid cells , 
 on the other hand , other studies have claimed that the activation of the pth receptor in bone via the pka signaling pathway suppresses the wnt inhibitor sclerostin , thereby allowing wnt signaling to increase fgf23 synthesis . 
 it is , however , worth mentioning that reducing wnt signaling in vivo , by genetically inactivating its co - receptor , low - density lipoprotein receptor - related protein 6 ( lrp6 ) , did not affect fgf23-induced hypophosphatemia in hyp mice , as shown in hyp / lrp6 double mutant mice . 
 furthermore , injection of bioactive fgf23 protein into lrp6 mutant mice reduced serum phosphate levels to a similar degree as fgf23 injection into wild - type mice , providing a genetic and pharmacological evidence for a wnt - independent function of fgf23 in the regulation of phosphate homeostasis . 
 ( this issue ) claimed that pth , by activating nuclear orphan receptor ( nurr1 ) , can increase the transcription of fgf23 in bone cells . 
 structural analysis has found that nurr1 protein is lacking a ligand - binding cavity , and therefore may act as a ligand - independent transcription factor . in the fgf23 promoter region , 
 the presence of nurr1 response elements raises the possibility of its role in fgf23 synthesis . in a cell - based system , through over - expression and knock down of nurr1 , an association between pth and fgf23 is suggested . 
 moreover , in a rat model of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) , increased nurr1 mrna and protein levels were associated with increased fgf23 mrna expression , calcimimetic treatment of these ckd animals reduced pth and fgf23 levels , along with decreased calvarial nurr1 mrna and protein expression . despite the presence of nurr1 responsive elements in fgf23 promoter regions , the functionality of nurr1 responsive elements in fgf23 synthesis is not yet defined , and without mutagenesis studies , whether increased expression of nurr1 and fgf23 is a mutual regulation or merely an epiphenomenon , could not be established . moreover , to provide in vivo direct evidence , further studies will be needed to show that inactivating pth signaling , by targeting its receptors , can block pth induced nurr1 and fgf23 expression in long bones . 
 it is also worth mentioning that pth induced fgf23 synthesis is a cell - line specific phenomenon . 
 for instance , while pth can induce fgf23 in umr106 cell lines , no such response of pth on fgf23 is noted in ros16/2.8 cells . despite a better understanding of fgf23 biology in systemic regulation of phosphate turnover , factors inducing its skeletal expression are not yet fully documented . 
 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d , phosphate , calcium , iron , leptin , acidosis , secreted klotho and pth are the factors currently known to induce fgf23 production ( fig . 
 1 ) . it is a well - accepted fact that pth can induce the synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d in the kidney , and that , in turn , 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d can inhibit pth secretion by the parathyroid glands . 
 recent studies have claimed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d can stimulate fgf23 production in bone and that fgf23 can suppress 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin d production and pth secretion . 
 the ability of pth to directly stimulate fgf23 expression forms an endocrine regulatory feedback loop to control mineral ion metabolism . 
 studies , as the one highlighted here , will help us to understand molecular regulation of fgf23 synthesis and identify its yet to be documented functions .","serum phosphate levels low bone releases additional phosphate maintain homeostatic balance increasing resorption process mostly influenced activity pth dihydroxyvitamin pth alters receptor activator nuclear factor kappa b ligand osteoprotegerin rankl opg balance acting stromal cells stimulate rankl expression also reducing expression opg vitamin hand pth stimulates osteoclast differentiation activity resulting increased bone resorption

recent studies claimed dihydroxyvitamin stimulate fgf production bone fgf suppress dihydroxyvitamin production pth secretion","bone - derived fibroblast growth factor-23 ( fgf23 ) plays an important role in systemic phosphate turnover . 
 increased fgf23 activity results in hypophosphatemic , while reduced activity is linked to hyperphosphatemic disorders . 
 fgf23 , together with klotho as co - factor , can activate fgf - receptors in its target tissues to exert its functions 
 . however , molecular regulation of fgf23 synthesis is not clearly defined , and recent studies have found that pth can activate the nuclear receptor - associated protein-1 ( nurr1 ) to induce fgf23 transcription in bone cells ."
"fibro - osseous lesions ( fol ) are a poorly defined group of lesions affecting the jaws and craniofacial bones . 
 all are characterized by the replacement of bone by cellular fibrous tissue containing foci of mineralization that vary in amount and appearance . 
 recent world health organization classification ( 2005 ) for fibro - osseous lesions was considered while sub - dividing these into various groups [ table 1 ] . 
 so proper categorization requires good correlation of the history , clinical findings , radiographic characteristics , operative findings , and histologic appearance . 
 the aim of this study was to analyze various clinico - pathological and radiological features in the benign fol reported and to compare the features between fibrous dysplasia ( fd ) and cemento - ossifying fibroma ( cof ) . 
 these patients were treated for fol , reported to the hospital between 1989 and 2009 . 
 the clinical parameters included were age , sex , location , duration , family history , associated symptoms , and behavior of the lesion . 
 the radiographic appearance , histologic features , treatment , and follow - up data were also recorded . 
 basic clinical parameters such as age , sex , duration of lesion , family history , history of trauma , associated symptoms , palpatory findings , status of associated / involved teeth , associated pigmentation , site of the lesion , treatment , and recurrence details were retrospectively analyzed . 
 regarding site distribution , the maxilla was divided into two anatomic regions as anterior ( midline to distal surface of canine ) and posterior ( mesial surface of first premolar distally ) . 
 the mandible was divided into four anatomic regions such as anterior ( midline to distal surface of canine ) , posterior ( mesial surface of first premolar distally ) , angle ( from distal of third molar to the inferior portion of ramus ) , and ramus ( upper portion of the ramus beyond the occlusal plane ) . 
 radiological features were assessed for radiolucency , radiopacity , margin of the lesion , cortical - plate expansion , involvement of antrum , displacement , and resorption of teeth . 
 histopathologically , parameters such as type of bone ( mature / immature ) , cellularity , presence of cementum - like material , and nature of stroma were assessed . 
 a total of 80 cases of benign fols were recorded over the 20 years . among these , cof ( all variants ) was the most frequent tumor found in 60 patients with 63 lesions ( 73.2% ) and fd was found in 20 patients ( 24.4% ) . in general for fol , 
 the age ranged from 3 years to 65 years with a mean age of 23.3 years ; the majority of cofs and fds were seen in the second decade ( 38.3% and 65% respectively ) . 
 the male - female ratio for these 80 patients was 1:1 with slight female predilection ( 27 men and 33 women i.e. , 1:1.2 ) , whereas fd showed definite male predilection ( 13 men and 7 women , i.e. , 1.8:1 ) . 
 however , there was no significant correlation between the lesions and the sex with p > 0.05 [ figure 1 ] . 
 the sex distribution of 80 patients with fibro - osseous lesions most of the time , fol patients complained of a slow - growing swelling of the jaws and facial asymmetry ( 75 patients = 93.7% ) whereas in four patients ( 5% ) , it was an incidental finding ; all these four cases were later diagnosed to be cof . in one case of fd , 
 a biopsy was done because of a non - healing extraction socket . in case of cof , 
 the associated signs and symptoms involved pus discharge , tenderness , egg shell crackling , tender lymph nodes , ulceration of the overlying mucosa , numbness of lip and proptosis . 
 none of family history and past medical history data collected were contributory to our study except few which are listed below . 
 there were four cof patients recorded with history of extraction ( 2 patients ) , surgery for osteosarcoma ( 1 patient ) , and history of trauma ( 1 patient ) at the site of current presentation . when fol as a whole was taken , no specific jaw / side predilection was evident . 
 the cof showed slight mandibular predilection ( 1.37:1 ) unlike that of fd which showed definitive maxillary predilection ( 2.3:1 ) . 
 moreover , cof were often recorded in mandibular posterior region ( 51.2% ) , whereas at the time of presentation fd was recorded unilaterally in maxilla as a whole bone . 
 there were three cases of cof noted at the midline either in maxilla ( 1 patient ) or in mandible ( 2 patients ) and three other cases of cof crossed midline with an extensive presentation in the mandible . 
 the most posterior presentation of cof was noted in two of our cases in the ramus and angle of the mandible [ table 1 ] 
 . extensive involvement of facial bones like ethmoidal and frontal bone was seen in fd ( 2 patients ) , in four cases of cof { juvenile ossifying fibroma ( jof ) variant } , and in two patients with aggressive form of ossifying fibroma ( of ) ( which can not be classified as jof ) . 
 when the data was subjected for chi - square test , significant association was found between the fol and the site ( maxilla and mandible ) with p < 0.05 [ figure 2 ] . 
 the site distribution of 80 patients with fibro - osseous lesions mobility of teeth was seen in 13 patients which included 11 cases of cof and two cases of fds . in one case of cof , 
 the lesion was associated with displacement of teeth , whereas one cof showed impacted tooth . 
 radiographically , 23 ( 38.3% ) cofs showed mixed opaque and lucent areas , 19 ( 31.6% ) cases showed only radiolucent areas and 18 ( 30% ) cases showed only radiopacity . among these , 
 55 ( 91.6% ) had a well - defined border whereas 5 ( 8.3% ) cases were having diffuse outline . 
 a total of eight cofs , showed involvement of antrum , displacement and resorption of the teeth . among fds 
 , most of them showed mixed opaque and lucent areas ( 75% ) , diffuse borders ( 60% ) with only four cases ( 20% ) showing expansion of cortical plates , and five cases showing expansion of antrum . 
 only one case showed resorption of the associated teeth . in case of cof , on 34 ( 56% ) 
 occasions it was provisionally diagnosed as cof and fd was considered in four cases . among 20 fds , 15 ( 75% ) times fd was considered as a provisional diagnosis and only in two occasions , it was thought in terms of cof . 
 other provisional diagnosis considered were adenomatoid odontogenic tumor , ameloblastoma , aneurysmal bone cyst , odontoma , calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor , odontogenic myxoma , central giant cell granuloma , and odontogenic keratocyst for cof and osteoma for fd . 
 the cof on the post - operative histologic findings was seen as a well - demarcated lesion that was separated from the overlying cortical bone by a thin zone of fibrous tissue . 
 the stroma was fibro - cellular ( 42 cases ) and fibrous ( 18 cases ) with irregular thin trabeculae of woven bone ( 43 patients ) or lamellar bone ( 11 patients ) rimmed by osteoblasts . 
 basophilic , ovoid , cementum - like material was evident in 21 cofs : among these four were considered as jof  psammamatoid type . other features evident with regular histopathology 
 were the presence of giant cells ( 5 cof ) , myxoid areas ( 1 jof ) , and endothelial proliferation ( 1 cof ) . 
 fd showed merging of lesional bone with the normal along with highly fibrous stroma ( 8 cases ) consisting of immature trabeculae of woven bone ( 18 lesions ) giving a

 the fol of the jaws comprise a diverse , interesting , and challenging group of conditions that pose difficulties in classification and treatment . 
 common to all is the replacement of normal bone by a tissue composed of collagen fibers and fibroblasts that contain varying amounts of mineralized substance , which may be bony or cementum - like in appearance . 
 langdon et al . , suggested that certain fols of the jaw may represent different stages in the evolution of a single disease process . 
 although the first case report of fibro - osseous lesion was reported 60 years ago , there are only few retrospective studies regarding their clinic - pathological correlation . among them , the four important studies were carried out by alsharif et al . , on chinese population , ogunsalu et al . , on jamican population , langdon et al . 
 comparison of clinical parameters with previous studies however , although fol are one of the common lesions occurring in india , such a retrospective study is not reported in the english language literature . 
 we also tried to compare the features between cofs and fds , which are the only two groups of entities reported in this region . 
 aggressive variants seen in young adults are called as jof ( who 1992 ) . according to recent who classification of fols , 
 of is a well - demarcated lesion composed of fibrocellular tissue and mineralized material of varying appearances . 
 juvenile trabecular of and juvenile psammamatoid of are two histologic variants of of . due to the presence of cementum - like material of have been called as cementifying fibroma ( cf ) or cof if they have both cementum and bone - like material . 
 previous studies considered cementoid lesions as separate groups which included cemento - osseous dysplasia , gigantiform cementoma , and cementoblastoma . 
 however , alsharif et al . , has considered cof as cementoid lesions containing cementum - like material , since he has considered of as a separate entity . however , in 1992 the who grouped such lesions under the common denomination of cof on the grounds that they represented histologic variants of the same type of lesion . in this study , of and 
 cof are combined and no cementoid lesions were reported till today to our hospital . in our data , 
 24 cases were diagnosed as of , 21 as cof , 11 as cf , and 4 as jof . 
 however , we considered all 60 cases as a single entity ( cof ) in contrast to the study on chinese population where cof and of are assessed separately . 
 none of these cases showed any familial history as we know there are two case reports of familial cof . 
 the term fd was given by lichtenstein in 1938 , which was earlier described as osteitis fibrosa disseminate . 
 it is a genetically based sporadic disease of bone that may affect single or multiple bones ( monostotic or polyostotic ) or if it is occurring in multiple adjacent craniofacial bones , it is regarded as craniofacial fd . 
 fd may be part of jaffe - lichenstein 's , macunae albright 's , or mazabraud 's syndrome . in over 80% of cases 
 it is monostotic , whereas all 20 cases in our data showed a solitary lesion in the jaws , although few of maxillary lesions extending up to infra - orbital margin affect vision . 
 , was 27 years and 34 years , contrasting to what we got as 21 years for the present study . 
 early lesions may be radiolucent , but they become increasingly radiopaque and typically show a diffuse radiopacity or  ground glass appearance  . in the present study , 75% of the lesions showed mixed opacity and lucency , whereas two cases were completely radiolucent and three cases with complete radiopaque picture . 
 the key histologic features of fd are delicate trabeculae of immature bone with no osteoblastic rimming , enmeshed within a fibrous stroma giving a 
 mature bone was seen in one of our case and osteoblastic rimming was evident in few areas of five cases and stroma was mostly fibrocellular , although few showed a completely fibrous or vascular background . compared with previous studies,[468 ] both cof and fd were predominantly seen in younger population ( 25.5 years and 21 years respectively ) . 
 however , in our data , there was a definite male predilection ( 1.8:1 ) for fd which was contrasting to the previous studies.[468 ] when compared with fd , many of cof presented with associated symptoms like pus discharge , egg shell crackling , tenderness , ulceration of the overlying mucosa , numbness of lip , and proptosis which is unusual for these groups of lesions ( this involvement was seen in four patients diagnosed as jof ) . 
 other than jof , there are no previous reports of conventional cof showing highly aggressive behavior . only few fds presented with aggressive symptoms . 
 the involvement of other facial bones ( frontal , ethmoidal , antrum ) was a frequent finding in cof when compared with fd . 
 both cof and fd showed multiple recurrences . since few of our cof cases showed history of trauma and association with osteosarcoma , a careful detailing of these in the history 
 is emphasized although its correlation with the occurrence of the lesion can not be established through this study . as aggressive behavior and recurrence 
 was a frequent finding in few patients with cof , a long follow - up was advised . 
 juvenile ossifying fibroma was of predominantly psammamatoid type and finally , not a single cementoid lesion was reported for last 20 years .","sex distribution patients fibro osseous lesions time fol patients complained slow growing swelling jaws facial asymmetry patients whereas four patients incidental finding four cases later diagnosed cof

 however , studies on these groups of lesions on indian population were not carried out before . 
 so this motivated us to analyze the clinico - pathologic correlation of fibro - osseous lesions reported at our hospital.materials and methods : a retrospective review was made of all the lesions surgically treated in our hospital . 
 a total of 6,175 biopsies were performed during the study period . 
 all the cases which were histopathologically diagnosed as fols were included in the study . 
 the demographic data , radiographic features , and histopathologic findings were analyzed and compared with similar studies on other races.results and conclusion : we could find 80 cases diagnosed as fibro - osseous lesions and information about them was documented . 
 the most common fol reported in the region was cemento - ossifying fibroma ( cof ) ( 75% ) than fibrous dysplasia ( fd ) ( 25% ) . 
 these were commonly occurring in 2nd decade without any sex or site predilection . 
 however , cof was showing a slight female predominance and fd with a definite male predominance . 
 cof was commonly seen in mandible ( posterior region ) whereas fd mainly confined to the maxilla ( as a whole bone ) . 
 radiographically , most of cof showed well - defined mixed opaque and lucent areas whereas fd showed diffuse borders . 
 cortical plate expansion and resorption of associated teeth was a frequent finding in cof when compared with fd . 
 histopathologically , stroma was fibrocellular in many cases of cof , whereas most fds showed fibrous stroma , interspersed with mainly woven bone ."
"hemorrhage after percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( pcnl ) is a significant complication that occurs in a small percentage of cases . 
 however , arterial injuries sometimes require transarterial embolization to control the refractory bleeding . in patient presenting with refractory bleeding , 
 pseudoaneurysm formation is the most common cause with a reported incidence of 0.6 - 1% . 
 we report a case of early erosion of an embolization coil from the renal vasculature into the urinary collecting system causing urinary tract obstruction and urosepsis . 
 a 23-year - old male underwent left urs and pcnl for a left upper ureteric calculus and a 2.5-cm lower pole renal calculus in a community hospital in december , 2010 . 
 one week after nephrostomy tube removal , the patient experienced gross hematuria with clot retention . 
 the patient underwent endoscopic bladder clot evacuation and dj stent removal in the same hospital . 
 two weeks later , again he developed gross hematuria with fever and a significant decrease in hematocrit . 
 after resuscitation the patient was referred to our centre . on angiography , there was a pseudoaneurysm in the lower segmental renal artery . 
 after 3 months of embolization , the patient presented with high - grade fever , left flank pain and burning micturiton . on x - ray kub 2 coils were seen in left renal area , whereas 1 coil was seen in l3 transverse process area . 
 axial noncontrast and contrast - enhanced ct images showed left hydronephrosis with dilated upper ureter and an embolization coil in the upper ureter [ figure 1 ] . 
 x ray kub shows 2 coils in left renal area , 1 coil in l3 transverse process area . 
 ct urogram shows left hydronephrosis with dilated upper ureter and 2 coils in left kidney & 1 coil in upper ureter 
 in 1975 , angioembolization for renal pseudoaneurysm was reported in a human patient when an autologous blood clot was used to embolize a bleeding pseudoaneurysm as a temporary measure before nephrectomy . 
 we found only three case reports in which embolization coil migrated to the collecting system.[810 ] in all these case reports the coil eroded after 1 year following embolization . 
 all the three patients presented with hematuria and renal colic . in our case , patient presented early ( 3 months ) with complaints of renal colic and persistent fever after coil embolization . hypothetically three mechanisms of coil erosion have been proposed . 
 first , the diameter of arteriocaliceal communication might be larger than the embolization coil , and the coil gets extruded through the communication soon after placement . 
 second , the arteriocaliceal communication could get dilated over time because of inflammation due to infection or the constant irritation from the indwelling coil itself , leading to eventual erosion into the collecting system . 
 finally , rupture of the weakened wall of a pseudoaneurysm exposed to high arterial pressure may lead to erosion . according to the first hypothesis , 
 if the arteriocaliceal communication was larger than the embolization coil than all three coils would have extruded through the communication and gross hematuria would have reappeared . 
 the third mechanism would have lead to massive hematuria in addition to the coil migration . in this case 
 the patient presented with high - grade fever and left flank pain but not hematuria . 
 therefore in this case the second mechanism seems to be the most likely cause of erosion of the embolization coil . 
 one of the important but rare causes of urinary tract obstruction is the migration of embolization coil into urinary collecting system .","ct urogram shows left hydronephrosis dilated upper ureter coils left kidney coil upper ureter angioembolization renal pseudoaneurysm reported human patient autologous blood clot used embolize bleeding pseudoaneurysm temporary measure nephrectomy

 transarterial embolization is required to control the bleeding in such cases .

 an early erosion of the embolization coil from the renal vasculature into the urinary collecting system occurred , causing urinary tract obstruction and urinary tract infection ( uti ) . 
 the coil was retrieved ureteroscopically after control of uti with antibiotics .

"catheter - based radiofrequency ablation ( rfa ) delivered during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp ) has recently emerged as a possible therapeutic option within the bile duct 1 
 2 
 3 
 4 . 
 intrabiliary extension of neoplasm remains an important challenge in the endoscopic eradication of complex ampullary lesions 5 
 6 , and rfa may represent a viable treatment adjunct for this problem . 
 recently , the use of rfa at the ampulla and within the distal bile duct has been described 7 
 8 . 
 herein we present 4 cases assessing the technical feasibility , safety , and treatment outcomes of rfa employed at the time of ercp to treat ampullary lesions with intraductal extension . 
 the study was conducted at the medical university of south carolina ( musc ) from july 1 , 2014 through october 1 , 2015 . 
 after institutional review board approval , we retrospectively identified eligible adult subjects through the musc endoscopy report database ( endoworks , olympus america , center valley , pa ) by searching for reports that contained the keywords  radiofrequency ablation ( rfa )  and  endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ercp )  . 
 we excluded patients who underwent rfa of a stricture not associated with an ampullary lesion . 
 all procedures were performed by an experienced pancreaticobiliary endoscopist under general anesthesia using a side - viewing duodenoscope . 
 ampullary resection was performed either en bloc or in piecemeal fashion by delivering electrosurgical current through a snare with or without prior submucosal lift . 
 intraductal extension of the lesion was assessed cholangiographically ( fig .  1 ) and/or visually ( fig .  2 ) . in some cases , a biliary sphincterotomy extension and papillary balloon dilation 
 was performed to expose the inside of the terminal bile duct for assessment and therapy . 
 ablative therapy was delivered using a standard argon plasma coagulation ( apc ) probe ( erbe usa inc . , 
 mariette , ga ) at a flow rate of 1.0  l / min to 1.2  l / min and 30 to 40 maximum watts ( w ) and/or the habib endohpb rfa bipolar cautery probe ( emcision united kingdom , london , united kingdom ) at 10  w for 60 to 90 seconds , extrapolating from manufacturer s recommendations of 7 to 10  w    120 seconds 9 . 
 given the proximity to the pancreatic orifice and the benign nature of the target lesions , a shorter duration of treatment was chosen . in general , apc was reserved for treating exposed target tissue in the duodenum or very distal duct , whereas rfa was reserved for treating hidden or difficult to access tissue within the duct . 
 all patients undergoing rfa received a temporary pancreatic stent ( 5 fr , 2    5  cm ) and rectal indomethacin to reduce the risk of post - ercp pancreatitis ( pep ) , as well as a plastic endobiliary prostheses to prevent biliary obstruction and cholangitis . 
 cholangiogram showing a filling defect in the distal bile duct ( arrow ) representing bulky intraductal extension of an ampullary adenoma . 
 endoscopic view of the papilla after ampullectomy demonstrating intraductal extension of the adenoma ( arrow ) . 
 technical success was defined as the ability to successfully position the rfa probe across the biliary orifice and deliver thermal energy to the region of the papilla and terminal bile duct , resulting in coagulation of the visualized target areas . 
 clinical success was defined as endoscopic absence of polypoid or adenomatous - appearing tissue at the treatment site and histologic absence of neoplasm based on extensive follow - up biopsies from the papilla , pancreaticobiliary septum , biliary orifice , and distal bile duct . 
 when the distal bile duct was not fully exposed by prior sphincterotomy , a pediatric biopsy forceps was introduced into the distal duct to acquire tissue . 
 patient demographics , procedure indications , and treatment outcomes are listed in table  1 . 
 four eligible patients were identified , all of whom were men with a mean age of 63 years ( range 54    84 ) . 
 three patients ( 75  % ) had a history of familial adenomatous polyposis ( fap ) . 
 three patients were treated for ampullary adenoma and 1 for ampullary adenoma with a focus of adenocarcinoma ( he declined surgical evaluation ) .

 video 1 presents a synopsis of 2 representative cases . 
 all rfa procedures were technically successful , resulting in a perceptible tissue effect ( fig .  3 ) . 
 rfa was performed immediately following endoscopic resection in 1 case and during a subsequent session in the remaining cases . 
 the mean number of rfa sessions per patient was 1.5 ( range 1    3 ) . 
 all patients were discharged uneventfully after the procedure without any immediate adverse events ( aes ) . 
 one patient developed obstructive jaundice due to a fibro - inflammatory bile duct stricture at the level of prior rfa that manifested 3 days after biliary stent removal ( approximately 6 weeks after the rfa ) and has required ongoing endobiliary stent therapy in excess of 3 months . 
 3 patients had visual and histologic evidence of complete eradication ; the patient with a focus of adenocarcinoma who declined surgery developed overt invasive ampullary cancer . 
 video 1 this footage consists of 2 video clips demonstrating catheter - based rfa of intraductal ampullary adenoma 
 although endoscopic ampullectomy is the preferred treatment for noninvasive ampullary lesions with a success rate reported as high as 92  % 10 , biliary extension of neoplasm represents a significant obstacle to endoscopic eradication . 
 exposure and eversion of the adenoma through a biliary sphincterotomy to allow resection or ablation has been described in amenable cases 5 
 11 
 12 . 
 however , broad adenomatous involvement of the distal bile is associated with limited treatment success ( <  50  % ) and has been considered an indication for surgical resection 5 . 
 based on its ease of use and the ability to precisely position the probe within the distal duct , radiofrequency ablation may represent the first viable treatment adjunct for this challenging scenario . 
 to date , only single case reports of rfa for benign ampullary lesions have been described ; we aimed to expand our understanding of this technology by presenting our experience in 5 patients . 
 catheter - based rfa was technically successful in all cases , and based on short - term follow up in a small sample , may be safe and clinically effective . 
 however , because rfa induces thermal injury and subsequent necrosis of the bile duct wall and beyond , several safety concerns exist . 
 first , while rfa has been associated with a favorable safety profile when applied to malignant biliary strictures 1 
 2 
 3 
 4 , it remains unclear whether rfa in the intra - pancreatic portion of the bile duct without the protective buffer of a surrounding tumor  especially in the vicinity of the pancreatic orifice  will be associated with an increased risk of pancreatitis . until additional data on the risk of post - ercp pancreatitis in this context 
 if the pancreatic and biliary orifices are in close proximity , especially if adenoma appears to involve the pancreaticobiliary septum , it may be best to perform the rfa adjacent to a guidewire which has already been placed in the pancreatic duct ( subsequently guaranteeing pancreatic access for stent placement ) rather than adjacent to a plastic pancreatic stent which may be damaged or even fractured during rfa . 
 another safety concern is the development of clinically important post - rfa biliary strictures that occurred in 1 of our patients , akin to what has been observed in the esophagus after rfa of barrett s epithelium 13 . 
 this concern is particularly relevant in the context of benign ampullary disease in which patients do not typically undergo long - term stent placement , as is the case when rfa is performed for palliation of malignant strictures . along these lines , until additional data are available , we have attempted to minimize rfa across the cystic duct takeoff to avoid thermal injury - related obstruction of the cystic duct , which has intentionally been induced by electrohydraulic lithotripsy to treat refractory bile leak 14 .   in our series 
 , rfa appears to have provided effective adjunctive therapy in all 4 cases of benign pathology but was ineffective in the setting of early adenocarcinoma , underscoring the concept that surgical resection remains first - line therapy for ampullary cancer ( our patient declined surgery and chemoradiation ) . despite the apparent effectiveness for benign lesions , it is important to consider that intrabiliary extension is often nodular in nature , leading to heterogeneous contact between the rfa probe and the target tissue ; this may lead to incomplete therapy and/or an increased risk of buried neoplasm as is the concern when rfa is used to treat nodular barrett s esophagus . 
 moreover , it can be technically challenging to ensure circumferential contact of the probe and the target tissue within a dilated bile duct , even when luminal air is suctioned to induce collapse of the duct around the probe . in these cases , a balloon - based rfa device that flattens nodular tissue and maximizes treatment contact may be of value . 
 an additional consideration is that the proximal extent of neoplasm is often difficult to assess cholangiographically and the role of cholangioscopy to guide probe placement should be further explored . 
 prospective studies are necessary to evaluate these issues and determine the long - term effectiveness of this modality .   in summary , catheter - based rfa after endoscopic resection of ampullary lesions that extend up the bile duct is technically feasible . 
 concerns regarding injury to the pancreas and bile duct as well as incomplete treatment of nodular target tissue exist and will be addressed by additional clinical experience and research .","catheter based radiofrequency ablation rfa delivered endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ercp recently emerged possible therapeutic option within bile duct

"allergic disease is an increasingly prevalent problem affecting up to one - third of the general population in industrialized countries . 
 immunotherapy is a treatment modality that can modify the immunological response of the allergy sufferer so that the affected individual will stop reacting to involved allergens . 
 immunotherapy is indicated for the treatment of allergic rhinitis ( ar ) and asthma , and it may prevent development of asthma in patients with ar [ 1 , 2 ] . 
 immunotherapy can be administered by different routes amongst which we find injectable and oral vaccines . 
 injectable vaccines refers to the classical subcutaneous injection immunotherapy ( scit ) usually known as  allergy shots . 
 oral vaccines refer to sublingual immunotherapy ( slit ) where the allergens are administered as drops to the sublingual area even though the term oral vaccines may also include allergy tablets . 
 the purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of treatment results in patients with nasal allergies , with or without asthma , that were treated with either one or the other of these two treatment modalities : scit or slit . 
 there is a voluminous body of scientific evidence that proves that these two treatment modalities are efficacious for the management of allergic conditions but the issue of these two modalities having similar efficacy has not yet been fully addressed . 
 a review of the literature reveals only a few articles that directly address this issue [ 410 ] . in five of these reports [ 59 ] scit and slit 
 is found to have better results , and one report   finds both equally effective for ar patients but scit more effective for asthmatic patients . in our own experience , 
 slit and scit appear to be of similar efficacy   in this report the efficacy of one will be compared against the other . 
 scit is a well - established treatment modality that has been successfully used for many decades and is relatively well tolerated . 
 slit is also a very old treatment modality ( earliest description is from 1900 ) and yet , while commonly used in europe , it is still not well established in the usa . over the last 20 years the european medical community produced a large amount of high - quality evidence suggesting that slit is safer than scit [ 14 , 15 ] . while no single case of mortality has ever been reported with slit [ 12 , 16 ] this is not the case with scit [ 17 , 18 ] . 
 this study constitutes a retrospective , consecutive chart review of allergy patients treated by the author at his private office . 
 inclusion criteria were as follows : a patient of any age with nasal allergies with or without asthma that was treated with immunotherapy for at least for 6 months and had at least 2 complete evaluations . 
 a complete evaluation implies symptom scoring , evaluation of medication use , and determination of the peak flow meter ( pfm ) value . 
 these evaluations are done every 36 months as treatment progresses . because evaluations depend on patient 's cooperation not all the patients had the same number of evaluations , but any patient that was considered a candidate had to have 2 evaluations as a minimum . 
 we compared the first evaluation ( pretreatment ) and the last evaluation the patient had just at the time of inclusion for the study . 
 the symptoms in the pretreatment evaluation and the amount of medications the patient was taking at that time reflect how the patient was doing without immunotherapy treatment . 
 ethical considerations . 
 subjects ' privacy was respected by collecting and recording data in such a way that the subjects could not be identified , directly or indirectly , through identifiers linked to the subject . in other words , 
 a patient 's confidentiality would be protected by entering data in a simple spreadsheet with nonspecific identifiers as patient no . 
 1 , patient no . 2 , and so forth with subsequent refiling of the patient 's chart , according to usual procedure . 
 the content of the spread sheet became anonymous and ready for statistical analysis . after discussing with patient about their allergies and advising about environmental modification maneuvers a discussion about treatment options including immunotherapy follows . in our office scit or slit 
 is used to treat patients with inhalant allergies with or without bronchial involvement . the decision to use one or the other 
 economical considerations , living far from the office , busy schedule , or  needle phobia , 
 are examples of when a patient may chose slit . having severe asthma , being a very young patient or having medical problems that may render administration of scit risky are examples of why the treating physician will advise slit . 
 all patients were tested using a fivefold intradermal dilution skin test ( idt ) as taught by the aaoa [ 20 , 21 ] . 
 the test includes several panels : dust , dander , epidermals , molds , and pollens for our geographic area ( table 1 ) . 
 standardized antigens were used for testing and treatment whenever these were available ; otherwise weight / volume antigen extracts were used . after identifying the minimally reactive antigen concentration ( meaning first reactive wheal ) for each of the patient 's reactive allergens , scit vials or slit bottles 
 were formulated including all of the positive results ( reactive allergens in the intradermal test ) in the treatment mixture . 
 patients on slit were treated according to a previously published protocol   where the dose is slowly advanced from 1 drop per day to 5 drops per day until attaining the most concentrated mixture in the slit bottle . 
 the formulation was the same for both injectable and oral vaccines . while the concentration of antigens is exactly the same for both scit and slit but slit 
 is administered daily , patients on slit will receive a larger amount of antigen each week than those treated with scit . 
 the slit bottles are mixed with 7.5  ml . if we consider a single allergen , for example , dermatophagoides pteronyssinus ( dp ) , standardized dust mite dp has a concentration of 10,000  au / ml containing 68  mcg / ml of der p 1 and 71  mcg / ml of der p 2 antigens . if the minimally reactive antigen concentration occurred at dilution no . 3 and dose was advanced until mixing a vial from manufacturer 's concentrate , the cumulative dose 
 this patient would receive weekly by scit would be 200  au per week , while a patient treated by slit would receive 464  au per week . as stated before , 
 the initial allergen concentration in both scit and slit is the same : 80  au / ml as in both circumstances the extract ( with 10.000  au / ml ) will be diluted 125 times . 
 after one year of treatment the patient on scit would receive 9680  au and the patient treated by slit would receive 21149  au or 2.18 times more allergen . 
 a chi - square test was applied for the following allergens : dust mite , cat , roach , mold , tree - pollens , grass - pollens , and weed - pollens for both groups , scit and slit . 
 asthma diagnosis was based on the presence of recurrent cough , chest tightness , sob , or wheezing , having a spirometry consistent with airflow obstruction or having the symptoms respond to the administration of a short - acting broncho - agonist ( saba ) . recorded symptoms included runny nose , sneezing , nasal obstruction , itchy eyes , itchy ears , cough , shortness , and wheezing . 
 these were scored according to fell 's method   with a numerical analog from 0 through 3 as follows : 0 = symptom not present , 2 = symptom is moderate , 3 = symptom is severe . 
 medication use was also evaluated on a similar numerical scale as follows : 0 = medication is not being used , 1 = medication is being used once a week or less , 2 = medication is being used 23 times per week , 3 = medication is being used 4 or more times per week . 
 medications were generically grouped as allergy pills , intranasal steroids ( inss ) , and short - acting broncho - agonists ( sabas ) in the case of asthmatic patients . 
 the value of the pfm determination was used as the parameter to be recorded at each patient 's encounter . 
 ninety - three charts met the inclusion criteria , 50 on scit and 43 on slit . among the 50 patient 's on scit , 20 ( 40% ) were male , 30 ( 60% ) female ranging in age from 2.33 to 75 years ( mean 45  17.8 sd ) . 
 this compared to 43 patients on slit of whom 21 ( 49% ) were male , 22 ( 51% ) female ranging in age from 1.66 to 75 years ( mean 35  20.8 sd ) . 
 analysis of covariance for the dependent variables for which a significant pre / posttreatment by treatment modality interaction effects was obtained did not reveal gender or age to account for significant dependent variable variance ; in other words the results were not affected by age or gender so both groups can be considered homogeneous . 
 a chi - square test was applied for the following allergens : dust mite , cat , roach , mold , tree - pollens , grass - pollens , and weed - pollens . 
 results indicate that there are no statistical differences between both groups ( at the p < 0.05 level ) ; therefore in their reactivity to allergens both groups can also be considered homogeneous . 
 there were 3 children < 12 years on scit ( mean 7.8 years ) versus 11 on slit ( mean 6.9 years ) . 
 ten ( 20% ) scit patients had asthma versus 12 ( 28% ) on slit . 
 thus a greater percentage of asthmatics ( 12/22 or 55% ) and more children under 12 years of age ( 11/14 or 79% ) were on slit . 
 length of treatment for the scit group was 12 to 86 ( mean 31  18.7 sd ) months and for the slit group was 10 to 32 ( mean 19  6.3 sd ) months . 
 for all patients the pre- and posttreatment averages for each symptom , medication use , and pf value were statistically compared through the use of repeated measure analysis of variance ( anova ) . 
 the results for the two treatment modalities ( scit versus slit ) were also compared using the between - subjects factor of the anova ( table 2 ) . 
 the same analyses were completed for medication use ( table 3 ) . for the pf evaluation the pre- and post - treatment values 
 were compared ( table 4 ) . in table 2 the mean value for each symptom score before treatment and at the time of data collection 
 the result of the test of significance is shown for each symptom within each treatment modality ( paired t - test ) . 
 lastly , the result of the statistical analysis comparing symptom improvement with one or the other treatment modality is shown . 
 shortness of breath and wheezing had significant improvements at p < 0.05 for both treatment modalities . 
 the remaining symptoms had a significant improvement at p < 0.001 for both treatment modalities . 
 wheezing and coughing were the only symptom scores which seemed to respond better to either scit ( coughing slightly better , p = 0.037 ) or slit ( wheezing slightly better , p = 0.024 ) , though both symptoms significantly improved regardless of treatment modality . 
 both scit and slit provided equally significant reduction in use of medication ( p < 0.001 ) including allergy pills , ins , and , to a slightly lesser but still significant degree , saba ( table 3 ) but without no significant difference between both treatment modalities . 
 pf value before treatment and at the time of the last patient evaluation is shown in table 4 . 
 both treatment modalities were equally effective in achieving a significant increase in pf values ( p < 0.001 ) but there was no significant difference between both treatment modalities . 
 this paper is a retrospective chart review and as such lacks the rigor of a prospective randomized study with a placebo control group which is very difficult to do in a private office setting . while an analysis of covariance is useful , it is not a perfect solution . 
 a future , larger - scale study should be planned to include the above design characteristics . 
 we observed that patients usually come to the office already using one or more allergy medications . 
 this study , like others , demonstrates that immunotherapy , whether scit or slit , will lead to the reduction of medication use for ar and/or asthma . 
 it was not the purpose of this paper to evaluate the effect of medications on allergy symptoms but rather to compare the effects of scit versus slit on medication use . 
 both treatment modalities resulted in the reduction of antihistamines , inhaled nasal steroids , and sabas . 
 the slight imbalances in demographic characteristics between the groups on scit versus slit were not statistically significant and did not affect the statistical results . 
 the reason why there are more young patients and more asthmatic patients in the slit group can be explained by the fact that slit is safer and easier to administer therefore it is suggested more frequently for these difficult - to - manage patients . 
 indeed we would have expected a much more pronounced difference ; yet fewer than expected chose slit because it is not covered by insurance . 
 patients on scit have been treated for a longer period of time because slit was added to our practice later than scit . 
 the improvement of the asthmatic symptoms wheezing and sob and the decrease in saba use were significant at p < 0.05 yet because of sample size this is not as strong as the improvement in other symptoms or medications that had an improvement at the level of p < 0.001 . 
 the advantage for scit in treating coughing is real , but the effect size ( eta - squared ) is only 0.025 , meaning that it only accounts for 2.5% of the variance in pre- versus posttreatment differences , which is not much . 
 the advantage of slit in treating wheezing may have been influenced by our own bias of suggesting slit use to asthmatic patients as a safer treating modality . 
 it is therefore more likely that patients with higher symptom scores were present in the slit group . 
 our findings demonstrate that slit is not only effective in controlling symptoms in nasal allergy patients with or without asthma , in decreasing medication use in such patients , and in improving parameters of pulmonary function , but it also appears that slit is as effective as scit these findings are in agreement with those published in the european literature [ 26 , 27 ] but certainly this presentation lacks the scientific validity of other reports   that present a prospective , randomized , controlled study ; therefore this presentation we hope will serve as a stimulus for centers with the capability to undertake such a study to continue with this line of research . 
 this would help the fda to finally recognize slit as an effective and safe treatment modality . 
 if slit became an fda - approved treatment modality ( and hopefully ) reimbursed by insurance companies many more patients might be receptive to immunotherapy which is a treatment capable of altering the immunological mechanisms responsible for the development of allergic conditions . 
 pf values for asthma control should be taken as a guideline only because the predicted lung function has a high degree of variability with significant differences in pf values according to presence or not of lung disease , smoking , age , sex , and even patient 's social environment [ 2931 ] . 
 having the advantage of providing results quickly , and requiring little training ( from the patient as well as from the technical staff ) , the pfm device is useful to monitor progress during immunotherapy . 
 it is most useful when the changes in pf values are compared to the initial value of each patient , recorded at the time of treatment initiation . for the purpose of this study individual improvement with therapy is not reported , but rather an overall trend , thus the use of pfm provides a gross indicator of change . 
 some of our patients were children , and it is expected they grow during treatment . certainly using a pfm as a tool to determine improvement in pulmonary function adds uncertainty as to whether the improvement in pf value is related to clinical improvement or to the growth of the patient during treatment . in this 
 we have demonstrated that the pf value in patients treated by immunotherapy increases regardless of age or asthmatic condition . in our experience , 
 the use of slit with multiple antigens has enabled us to treat patients that otherwise would have not received immunotherapy , or would have not continued to receive immunotherapy , like asthmatic patients with poorly controlled asthma , patients that had severe arm reactions , very young patients to whom it is difficult to administer shots or patients whose schedules prevent them from being compliant . 
 these results suggest that scit and slit exhibit similar efficacy . slit objectively improves symptom scores for asthma and ar while decreasing medication usage of allergy medications and sabas . 
 given the increased risk and difficulty in treating asthmatic and young patients , these results would suggest that slit should be considered as the main treatment modality for these patients , considering scit only for treatment failures . 
 the results of this study are in agreement with the european literature and therefore would support the inclusion of slit in the routine management of the allergic disease .","purpose study compare efficacy treatment results patients nasal allergies without asthma treated either one two treatment modalities scit slit

"reservation - based native americans live in pervasively adverse social and physical environments that place them at increased risk of exposure to a myriad of stressors during childhood which impact their psychological and physical health over their lifetimes . 
 about 1 of 2.9 million native americans that identify as native american alone resides on reservations . 
 indian reservations were established by treaty during the removal and relocation ( 18271887 ) period and are lands set aside for tribes in exchange for ceded land and resources . 
 of the ten poorest counties in america , five are home to an indian reservation . 
 concentrated poverty results in higher crime rates , underperforming public schools , poor housing , and poor health and limits access to many services and job opportunities . 
 adverse childhood experiences ( aces ) that are substantial contributors to health disparities include childhood physical and sexual abuse , witnessing violence , poverty , and racism . 
 the concept that these experiences become biologically embedded has gained substantial support and provides an explanatory mechanism for health disparities . 
 aces are linked to differences in the function of the stress - response system including the neuroendocrine system , the parasympathetic nervous system , and the immune system . 
 these changes likely have substantial long and short term impacts on health and well - being . 
 it is likely that these changes are shaped by epigenetic modifications which alter the function but not the structure of the gene . 
 epigenetic modifications are considered to be an individual 's molecular response to the environment and occur in an effort to preserve the health of the individual by increasing the accessibility of genes for transcription and translation that relate to immediate survival . 
 these genes code for proteins that prepare the individual to be able to respond to the stressor through a fight or flight response ; yet , in native americans living on reservations , the stressors most encountered are chronic , not acute . 
 thus , this adaptive response likely results in overactivation of this stress - response system , and this excessive activity has substantial negative consequences on the health and well - being of native americans , individually and across generations . here 
 we provide a conceptual review of how nurses and other health care professionals can examine health disparities in native americans through epigenetic modifications that likely result from aces ( see figure 1 ) , including historical trauma , the residual of which is assumed to be historical loss associated symptoms . 
 we expect this conceptual framework to have implications for or be relevant to the mechanisms of health disparities in other racial or ethnic groups . 
 a neighborhood 's safety and access to quality health care , economic opportunities , social connections , and social capital are all key determinants of the health of its residents over time [ 912 ] . 
 reservations are often characterized by low economic status and segregation , both of which limit access and are risk factors for higher rates of morbidity and mortality [ 13 , 14 ] . 
 chronic stress such as that which accompanies experiences of racism and poverty over a lifetime places individuals at risk for posttraumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) . 
 unique to native americans is the race - based stress associated with historical trauma , as well as discrimination [ 1720 ] . 
 historical trauma is defined here as the  collective experience of violence perpetrated against indigenous peoples in the process of colonizing the americas resulting in an unresolved humanitarian crisis for reservation communities . 
 the effects of historical trauma are proposed as being transmitted across generations with historical loss associated symptoms currently exhibited [ 2123 ] and include symptoms of complicated bereavement and complex ptsd . 
 this type of trauma has been linked to impaired individual and collective tribal identity [ 16 , 24 ] , which likely also relates to stress and morbidity risk . over 50% of native americans 
 indicate that they think about loss related to historical trauma , such as loss of language , loss of culture , and loss of land , at least occasionally , and which caused them psychological distress [ 17 , 25 ] . 
 discrimination has been associated with early substance use among native american children , and suicidal behavior , and anger , and aggression among adolescents [ 18 , 20 , 26 ] . 
 thus , this stress combined with other aces may be a significant contributor to health disparities . 
 native americans are disproportionally affected by trauma in childhood , including abuse , neglect , and exposure to intimate partner violence ( ipv ) [ 2729 ] . 
 approximately half of native american adolescents and young adults have been exposed to one or more severe traumatic events , and 98% have experienced a traumatic event of any severity . 
 native american adolescents are more likely than other adolescents to witness violence or to have been physically abused , sexually abused , or neglected as a child , resulting in rates of ptsd that are twice that of the estimated rates in the general u.s . population . 
 assaultive trauma in childhood is linked to the highest risk for ptsd , suggesting that this ace is specifically linked to this high risk for psychiatric disorders . 
 specifically , trauma that involves physical or sexual assault prior to adolescence places an individual at five to ten times the risk for ptsd onset compared to an individual without this experience [ 32 , 33 ] . witnessing abuse during childhood , as well as residing in a high - crime area , 
 is also linked to a far greater risk for ptsd [ 34 , 35 ] ; however , assaultive trauma at an early age is the ace most linked to ptsd onset . 
 these studies link physical abuse , witnessing domestic violence , and parental alcohol and drug abuse to a vulnerability for depression symptom onset [ 36 , 37 ] . in addition , residing in an urban , socioeconomically disadvantaged area has also been linked to risk of depression onset as well as drug use . 
 exposure to trauma also increases the risk for the early onset of substance use and the onset of substance use disorder . 
 other studies have found similar results , including that aces increase the risk for drug use and early alcohol abuse and increased the rates of initiating these behaviors during adolescence by a factor of two to four [ 41 , 42 ] . 
 thus , aces in general are linked to psychiatric disorder vulnerability , with high degree of comorbidity among these disorders . 
 reservation - based native americans die at higher rates than other americans from tuberculosis ( 750% higher ) , alcoholism ( 524% higher ) , diabetes ( 293% higher ) , unintentional injuries ( 153% higher ) , homicide ( 103.3% higher ) , and suicide ( 66% higher ) ( 20022004 , rates adjusted for misreporting of race on state death certificates ) . not only do native americans bear a disproportionate burden of disease , but they also experience a lower life expectancy . 
 life expectancy is an overall measure of quality of life   and is one of the indicators used to measure the magnitude of the burden of health disparities . in general , 
 native americans born in 20002002 have a life expectancy that is about 2.4 years less than the overall us population rate : 76.9 years compared to 74.5 years for native americans . however , when this average is disaggregated by ihs area , the life expectancy ranges from 64.8 years ( 11 years less than for the u.s . ) in the aberdeen area to 76.4 years ( greater than the u.s . 
 average of 75.8 years ) in the california area ( adjusted for race miscoding ) using 19941996 data ; thus highlighting the within group differences . 
 additionally , the indian health service , using 2000 census data , found 25.7% of all native americans were living below the poverty level , compared to 12.4% of the u.s . 
 population overall . the bureau of justice , in the first comprehensive statistical analysis of  american indians and crime ,  reports native american are the victims of violent crimes at two times the rate of the u.s . 
 population overall , and about 7 in 10 violent victimizations involved an offender who was reported by the victim to be a person of another race . 
 however , this may not apply to all communities , especially those that are more remote and isolated where few non - native american people live . 
 another report by the department of justice , disclosed native americans sustain rates of violent victimization ( rape , sexual assault , robbery , aggravated assault , and simple assault ) at rates that are 2 times higher than african americans , 2.5 times that of hispanics , 3 times that of caucasians , and 6.5 times that of asians . 
 ptsd is the anxiety disorder most linked to trauma and its prevalence in native americans adults is 4.4 times the national average [ 25 , 49 ] . 
 there is little research regarding the impact that adversity has on tribal communities , so it remains poorly understood . the adverse childhood experiences ( ace ) study suggests that certain adversities are major risk factors for morbidity and mortality . 
 the study established a relationship between adversity in childhood and suicide attempt , prescription drug use , alcoholism and alcohol abuse [ 53 , 54 ] , illicit drug use , obesity , and depressive disorders . among adolescents and young adults , 
 childhood adversity was also associated with a greater risk for interpersonal violence perpetration , poor perceived health , more medical care visits , and additional somatic concerns . 
 therefore , current studies link aces to risks to health and well - being ; however , the mechanisms underlying these risks have not yet been well described . 
 in some cases , genetic predisposition may explain some of the enduring effects of aces ; however , the evidence for this link remains poorly understood . 
 genetic inheritance provides information encoded in dna which is transcribed to various types of rna molecules which likely shape the response of the individual to stressors such as aces . 
 one important concept related to phenotypic variation is heritability , which estimates the extent of which genetic inheritance contributes to the phenotypic variance in a population . 
 heritability is the percent of variation in the genome responsible for the difference in the phenotype . 
 another parameter used to estimate the contribution of genomic factors in phenotypes is relative risk , which refers to an individual 's risk of developing a condition with a family history compared to those without a history . when the heritability estimate or relative risk of a phenotype is low , the influence of the genome sequence is considered to be relatively smaller than the influence of other factors such as environment , and the genomic influence can be easily masked or have a negligible impact . since most human diseases involve many genes , their interactions , and nongenetic factors , an approach termed  endophenotypes  is used to characterize the disease in a molecular or genetic manner , rather than using a clinical diagnosis to define the phenotype . 
 polymorphisms in native americans have been linked to a greater vulnerability for alcohol abuse , as well as obesity . in general , 
 samples of trauma exposed participants link endocrine gene ( fkbp5 ) polymorphisms to a greater risk for ptsd development [ 59 , 61 ] ; yet , these are small and do not include native americans . 
 thus , it is essential to consider unique genetic inheritance features in native americans which interact with epigenetic modifications and likely contribute to health disparities . 
 the stress - response system provides the individual protection from acute stressors through an activation of interactive biological systems . 
 one biological system that is central to this response and is linked to aces is the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal ( hpa ) axis , with the end result of activation of this system being the production of cortisol . 
 in addition to playing a pivotal role in activating the stress response , the hpa axis also influences biological functions related to mood , growth , immune function , metabolism , and regulation of biological systems on circadian rhythm . the sympathetic nervous system ( sns ) 
 also is activated by stress providing neuronal focus and energy to muscles in order to escape the stressor . 
 although these systems are effective in adapting to acute stress , chronic activation is linked to negative consequences . 
 both the hpa axis and sns impact immune function , and chronic stress is linked to a risk for inflammation . 
 overactivation of the hpa axis results in disruptions of functioning at rest and following stressors , and these changes have been linked to aces . 
 hpa axis alterations are linked to health disparities through mechanisms that include impaired neuronal growth and survival , inflammation , reductions in neuropeptide activity , and accelerated cellular aging [ 6365 ] . 
 sns function changes have also been linked to health disparities , with one of the most pivotal mechanisms being a lack of circadian variation in blood pressure , a key risk factor for myocardial infarctions . 
 evidence is accumulating that environmental influences early in development remain pervasive into adulthood , a relationship that is attributed to an interaction of gene function and environment . 
 both genetic and environmental factors are critical to developmental processes and even minor changes in either type of factor can result in trajectories of resilience or vulnerability ; however , it is the interaction between these factors that may provide the most vital information to understand the heterogeneous response to trauma . 
 this leads us and others to question how future research can address this critical issue . 
 these changes occur through mechanisms such as histone modification , methylation , acetylation , and noncoding ribonucleic acids which alter the accessibility of genes for transcription . 
 the resulting transcription modifications and protein production result from factors such as environmental challenges including , but not limited to , aces [ 68 , 69 ] . 
 an individual 's genome interacts with internal and external factors to create phenotypes such as height , physical appearance , personality , and alterations in the stress - response system . 
 preclinical models illustrate how aces result in epigenetic modifications in neurons , thereby increasing the risk for psychiatric symptoms . to illustrate this link , a study reports that the offspring of high - licking canine mothers exhibit reduced methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor gene   and endocrine regulation of a subsequent stressor . 
 in contrast , offspring that face early adversity exhibit endocrine dysregulation , as well as reductions in neuronal plasticity in the prefrontal cortex ( pfc ) that persist into adulthood . in studies of rats who exhibit ptsd - like behavior , there is evidence of increased methylation of stress - response genes including brain - derived neurotrophic factor and nuclear protein phosphate-1   in neurons . 
 although these studies provide additional evidence linking aces to methylation changes in neurons , these studies are not able to clearly determine psychiatric symptoms . 
 therefore , these studies are limited by not being able to determine the comprehensive risks that relate to aces . 
 the ace most linked to epigenetic differences and vulnerability for health disparities is that of child abuse . to illustrate this link , in a hallmark study by labont in suicide completers , aces were linked to increased dna methylation of the glucocorticoid receptor in the hippocampus , and this differential methylation was particularly linked to childhood abuse . 
 study , whose subject group was also suicide completers , which reported that childhood abuse was associated with greater methylation levels at cpg sites in the exon1f of the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene . 
 these studies had the distinct advantage of examining epigenetic modifications in neurons , which is not available in other studies . 
 epigenetic patterns differ among cell types , even differing among brain regions [ 79 , 80 ] . 
 thus , an additional challenge to understanding the impact of aces on health disparities is to determine how epigenetic alterations in the brain differ from those in peripheral tissues and how to advance despite this methodological challenge . 
 in addition , these few studies are not able to determine the role of preexisting methylation in this risk or to measure other factors that may contribute to methylation changes . 
 epigenetic changes resulting from aces can also be observed in studies that use peripheral blood in living participants , which show that hpa - regulating genes are often impacted . a study by klengel et al . 
 linked aces to reduced methylation of the fkbp5 gene , an essential regulator of the stress response , as well as to changes in the function of the hpa axis under stress , and to reduced cognitive ability . direct physical abuse and observing the abuse of a mother have also been associated with greater methylation levels at cpg sites in the exon1f of the promoter region of the glucocorticoid receptor gene in leukocytes . 
 similar methylation profiles are also reported in the peripheral blood of babies whose mothers were depressed during the third trimester of pregnancy , and these methylation changes were related to salivary cortisol elevations at three months of age . although glucocorticoid receptors in peripheral tissue may differ from those on the hpa axis , the link between methylation of the glucocorticoid gene in the periphery and the function of the hpa axis has been demonstrated in multiple studies in addition to those of oberlander et al . , 2008 . 
 additional studies that include analysis of blood samples collected closer to the time of the ace may provide additional insights into the individual variation in response to aces . other studies link aces to hypomethylation of inflammatory genes , suggesting that these experiences result in a greater inflammation later in life . in a recent study of children who were removed from their parents due to abuse or neglect , a reduction in methylation of nr3c1 , an inflammatory regulation gene , as well as differential methylation of cancer related pathways was found in children with aces compared to controls . 
 a study of adults linked child abuse to reduced methylation of igf2as , an antisense transcript of the insulin - like growth factor gene , which encodes for the inflammatory cytokine family of growth factor beta . 
 borghol et al . linked childhood poverty to differential methylation of genes related to metabolism and inflammation , and these changes were different from those in participants who experience poverty only during adulthood . 
 together these studies provide evidence that a variety of aces result in methylation changes , suggesting that these molecular changes likely contribute to health disparities ; however , additional , larger , and more representative studies are needed to determine relationships . altered serotonergic neurotransmission is also postulated to result from aces and provides a mechanistic link to increased vulnerability for psychiatric disorders . 
 the iowa adoption study demonstrated a link between hypermethylation of the serotonin gene slc64a to childhood sex abuse , and this molecular change mediated the development of antisocial personality disorder . 
 this group was also able to relate differences in gene expression of serotonin related genes to methylation , and that genotype influenced methylation at cg22584138 . 
 additional studies are needed to determine the role of other aces in serotonergic gene methylation and to determine how aces contribute to psychiatric risks . 
 clinical studies are restricted to examining differential methylation in samples of peripheral fluids , but these studies do provide some key insights into how these molecular changes relate to ptsd , depression , and drug abuse risk . 
 for instance , ptsd is associated with changes in the methylation of inflammatory ( toll - like receptors 1 & 3 , il-8 , chemokine ligand 1 , and others ) and endocrine genes fk506 binding protein-5 ( fkbp5 ) . another study that measured dna methylation reported that postdeployment hypomethylation of line-1 was associated with ptsd onset following deployment . 
 one study determined that serotonin transporter gene ( slc6a4 ) methylation levels were modified by the effect of the number of traumatic events on ptsd after controlling for slc6a4 genotype , such that persons with more traumatic events were at increased risk for ptsd , but only at lower methylation levels . 
 the other study found that the candidate gene man2c1 showed a significant methylation  trauma experience interaction , such that those with both higher man2c1 methylation and greater exposure to traumatic events showed an increase in risk of lifetime ptsd . 
 thus , there is evidence that ptsd is associated with similar methylation differences in immune , endocrine , and neurotransmitter genes to those linked to aces ; suggesting that these chronic differences may be a result of aces , yet additional prospective studies are needed to better describe these relationships . 
 carried out the first genome - wide dna methylation scan in major depressive disorder patients . 
 the study pinpointed 224 candidate regions , primarily involved in neuronal growth and development genes , which showed differential methylation ; prima1 showed the greatest differences . 
 specific genes that have been shown to be differentially methylated in individuals with depression include those that code for angiotensin converting enzyme , brain - derived neurotrophic factor , orexin a , and gamma - aminobutyric acid receptor alpha1 . 
 in addition to observing differential dna methylation in ptsd and depression , many studies have observed methylation differences in those that suffer from drug abuse as compared to healthy controls . 
 increases in dna methylation of the oprm1 gene that codes for opioid receptors have been reported in individuals with chronic opioid use [ 99102 ] and alcohol dependence , and global methylation differences have also been reported for these two populations [ 99 , 104 ] . 
 the proopiomelanocortin gene promoter , dopamine transporter gene promoter , homocysteine - induced endoplasmic reticulum protein promoter , and alpha synuclein promoter   were found to be differentially methylated in individuals with alcoholism compared to healthy controls . 
 methylation at the monoamine oxidate a locus was also significantly associated with nicotine and alcohol dependence in women , but not in men . 
 together these studies show that psychiatric disorders related to aces are associated with methylation changes that may be reflective of aces or psychiatric symptoms ; however , there are no prospective studies to elucidate the possible mediating role of methylation on these psychiatric risks in individuals that experience aces . 
 reservation - based native americans disproportionately experience aces and health disparities , significantly impacting long - term physical and psychological health . 
 in addition to these experiences , the persistence of stress associated with discrimination and historical trauma converges to add immeasurably to these challenges . 
 here we provide evidence to suggest that aces result in methylation differences in genes that regulate the stress response and that these changes may contribute to an increased vulnerability for developing psychiatric disorders , as depicted in figure 1 . 
 although we postulate these relationships , the lack of prospective studies in this at - risk group prevents us and others from concluding this causality , as well as more studies that include native americans . 
 thus , additional studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms through which aces contribute to health and well - being . 
 these studies may inform future interventions to address these serious risks and promote the health and well - being of native americans .","provide conceptual review nurses health care professionals examine health disparities native americans epigenetic modifications likely result aces see figure including historical trauma residual assumed historical loss associated symptoms

"phakic intraocular lens ( piol ) provides internal compensation of the dysfunctional refractive condition of the phakic eye and reduces or eliminates the dependence on glasses or contact lens . 
 an implantable lens consisting of a biocompatible collagen copolymer ( visian implantable collamer lens [ icl ] ; staar surgical , nidau , switzerland ) was developed in 1993 as a posterior chamber piol and was called the implantable contact lens , as initially it was thought that it would come into contact with the anterior surface of the crystalline lens . 
 staar ( monrovia , ca , usa ) patented this material made of 60% poly - hydroxyethylmethacrylate 
 hema , water ( 36% ) , benzophenone ( 3.8% ) , and 0.2% porcine collagen , and called it the collamer ( collagen - copolymer).1 , 2 icl is a posterior chamber phakic iol which is a soft , flexible gel - lens ushering an era of reversible refractive surgery . 
 icls are ciliary sulcus placed posterior chamber piols that can be implanted through a small ( 3.0  mm ) , self - sealing limbal / clear corneal incision . 
 in contrast with refractive lens exchange , icl implantation does not impair natural accommodation or increase the risk of retinal detachment above the background rate for untreated patients with high myopia , and have a good safety profile . 
 icl is a boon in achieving spectacle independence in patients who are unsuitable for laser refractive procedures like those with high myopia ( > 13diopter d ) , thin corneas , those with expected residual stromal bed thickness less than 300   , and severe dry eye . with its increasing acceptance and establishment of safety profile 
 , icl implantation has become an increasingly popular choice for the correction of moderate to high myopia.4 , 5 the convexo - concave design of the icl creates a vault between it and the anterior lens surface . 
 however , the previous v4b icl model is known to cause pupillary block , and so either a preoperative / intraoperative laser / surgical peripheral iridotomy / iridectomy ( pi ) is required . to overcome this additional step , the v4c model with a central hole ( 0.36  mm ) was developed in 2011 . 
 it has a central hole in addition to two additional holes outside the optic facilitating aqueous outflow and removal of ophthalmic viscosurgical device ( ovd ) during surgery . 
 however , complications of icl implantation such as cataract formation ( anterior subcapsular lens opacities - typical butterfly cataract ) , endothelial cell loss , pigment dispersion , intraocular pressure ( iop ) elevation , and secondary glaucoma have been reported , and these complications are expected to increase with time.4 , 5 studies have shown good acceptance profile of both the icl models.4 , 5 , 7 in view of the increasing prevalence of this surgical procedure , we conducted this study to evaluate the visual outcome , complication rate and safety indices of both the v4b and v4c icl models for the correction of high myopia in a tertiary eye care center in south india over a follow - up period of 9 months . 
 all patients undergoing icl implantation for the correction of high myopia ( manifest spherical equivalent  mse    6 d ) were included in the study . 
 the following were the inclusion criteria : ( a ) age between 21 and 45 years , ( b ) stable refraction within the past 1 year , ( c ) patients not suitable for corneal - based laser refractive procedures  those with abnormal corneal topography and keratoconus , predicted thin residual stromal bed thickness of less than 300   , high refractive errors of > 13 d , severe dry eye , ( d ) corneal diameter  >  11  mm , ( e ) internal anterior chamber depth  acd ( measured from endothelium )  >  2.9  mm . 
 bilateral implantation of the same icl model for the correction of bilateral moderate - high myopia was preferred in an individual patient . 
 a detail preoperative assessment was carried out including uncorrected distant visual acuity ( udva ) , corrected distant visual acuity ( cdva ) , iop measurement with non - contact tonometry 
 nct ( nt-510 nidek technologies , japan ) and a gonioscopy to ensure wide open angles . 
 a detailed slit - lamp examination to rule out any ocular pathology was done . a detailed fundus examination to rule out any myopia - related or other fundus pathology was done , and prophylactic barrier laser , if required , was given . automated and manual keratometry values were recorded using topcon kr-8800 and ultrasound pachymetry using tomey pachymeter sp2000 . 
 corneal topography was performed using optikon 2000 keratron scout topographer ( optikon , italy ) and axial length and anterior chamber depth ( acd ) by sonomed pacscan 300a ( sonomed , inc . 
 the white - to - white ( wtw ) diameter was measured using a digital biometric ruler - digital calipers . 
 endothelial cell count ( ecc ) was measured using tomey em-3000 specular microscope ( tomey corporation , japan ) . 
 the icl power was calculated using the staar surgical customer service department formula that uses the acd , mean keratometry or simulated keratometry values , central corneal pachymetry , horizontal wtw distance , and refraction 12  mm from the corneal vertex . 
 the horizontal axis was marked with the patient sitting at the slit lamp prior to the surgery . 
 two dots were placed on the corneal - limbal area with a surgical marker indicating 0 and 180 meridians as reference for later toric icl ( ticl ) alignment . 
 pupillary dilatation was achieved with a combination eye - drop containing 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine . 
 two 1  mm paracenteses were made using angled keratome or 15 side port knife at 12 and 6 o'clock positions . 
 hypromellose 2% ( viscomet pf , unimed technologies ) viscoelastic was injected into the anterior chamber taking care not to overfill the chamber . 
 the paracenteses were used to position the footplates under the iris using the special manipulating instruments like vukich 's manipulator .

 a total of 62 eyes of 32 patients with a mean    sd age of 24.56    4.8 years underwent v4b icl implantation ( 21 non - toric , 41 toric icl - ticl ) with intraoperative peripheral iridectomy ( pi ) , and 10 eyes of 5 patients with a mean    sd age of 26.13    3.8 years had implantation of v4c icl with central hole ( p  =  0.81 ) ( 4 non - toric , 6 ticl ) . 
 the large difference in the number of eyes in the two groups is due to the later development of the v4c model . 
 the mean preoperative manifest spherical equivalent ( mse ) was 9.98    2.8 d and 9.14    2.4 d in the v4b and v4c groups , respectively ( p  =  0.51 ) , which reduced to postoperative values of 0.24    1.3 d and 0.2    1.18 d , respectively ( p  =  0.09 ) . 
 the mse reduced significantly in the two groups ( p  <  0.001 in both the groups ) . 
 the mean preoperative astigmatism was 1.7    1.5 diopter cylinder ( dcyl ) and 1.8    1.5 dcyl which respectively reduced to 0.7    0.7 dcyl and 0.8    0.4 dcyl at 9 months ( p  <  0.001 in both the groups ) ( table 1 ) . 
 a gain of 1 line of cdva was seen in 10% and 11.76% eyes in v4b and v4c groups , respectively ( p  =  0.08 ) , while no change in cdva was seen in 90% and 88.24% of eyes ( p  =  0.07 ) . 
 no eye had loss of lines of cdva post surgery . at the end of 9 months 
 follow - up , mean ecc loss was 6.4% and 6.1% ( fig .  1 , fig 
 .  2 ) ( p  =  0.08 ) , mean vault was 573.13    241.13   , and 612    251.14   , respectively , in the v4b and v4c groups ( p  =  0.02 ) ( fig .  3 ) . 
 anterior subcapsular opacities were present in 6.9% and 3.14% of eyes with v4b and v4c groups , respectively ( p  <  0.01 ) . 
 four eyes from v4b ( 9.75% ) and 1 eye from v4c ( 16.66% ) groups had rotation of more than 30 and required re - alignment surgery which was done successfully ( fig .  4 ) . two eyes ( 3.22% ) with v4b icl implantation 
 had high postoperative iop ( > 35  mm hg ) due to blocked pi and required nd : yag laser iridotomy which was done with successful control of iop . 
 the safety indices were 1.11 and 1.14 and efficacy indices were 1.4 and 1.5 in the v4b and v4c groups , respectively , at the end of 9 months . at the end of 9 months , on questioning , the most common subjective symptom reported was glare and haloes in 23% and 25% in the two groups , respectively ( p  =  0.09 ) . however , they were not annoying enough to cause visual disability . due to the large difference in the sample size between the two groups , 
 the results of the intergroup comparisons done by the mann whitney u value test with p values is limited and need to be considered accordingly . 
 phakic intraocular lens implantation is so far the only refractive treatment for high myopia that offers preservation of accommodation and potential reversibility . in our study 
 , we found that both the types of icl with or without the central hole showed a satisfactory visual outcome which was maintained at the end of 9 months follow - up period . 
 . also found similar results with the two models with both providing good visual outcome and no difference in the objective scatter index and higher order aberrations . 
 icls have emerged as a successful and promising modality for the treatment of moderate to high myopia especially in candidates unsuitable for laser refractive procedures.10 , 11 though being an intraocular procedure , it provides the advantage of reversibility and an acceptable safety profile . with the advent of toric icl , a significant amount of astigmatism can be corrected . 
 the ticl have shown to be stable over a long term period with the haptics enforcing stable lens position in the ciliary sulcus . 
 the ticl is fundamentally different from toric intraocular lenses as it is not subject to contraction of the capsular bag . 
 the soft footplates of the icl conform to the normal undulating contours of the ciliary sulcus with a kind of lock - and - key situation where the footplates will drape over and into the tiny irregular features of the sulcus . 
 , we had 4 from v4b ( 9.75% ) and 1 eye from v4c ( 16.66% ) groups requiring realignment surgery with successful outcomes . 
 found an incidence of 1.7% of rotation in excess of 10 with 98.3% showing excellent rotational stability without decrease in visual acuity . 
 the iop was maintained below 21  mm of hg in both the groups over 9 months . 
 higueras - esteban et  al . found no significant changes between the v4b and v4c models with respect to iop stability . 
 studied the fluid dynamics of aqueous humor in v4c model and suggested that hole - icls improve the circulation of aqueous humor to the anterior surface of the crystalline lens . 
 sanders reported approximately 67% of eyes developing anterior subcapsular opacities at 7 year following icl implantation but only 12% had progressed to clinically significant cataract in the same period , especially in high myopes and older patients . 
 fernandes et al . also found cataract as the major complication . in our study , 
 none of the eyes had visually significant cataract at the end of 9 months follow - up period . in a study conducted by pothireddy et al . in india , 
 the safety index was 0.75 , and the efficacy index was 1.04 twelve months postoperatively . 
 icl was thus evaluated to be a safe and effective procedure in terms of visual outcome . 
 pineda - fernandez et al . reported mse in 61.1% and 22% of eyes within 1.00 d and 0.50 d of emmetropia . in their study , the mean residual sphere was 0.25 d , and mean residual cylinder was 0.12 dcyl . 
 insignificant refractive change during follow - up after icl implantation with similar results was obtained by igarashi et al . 
 demonstrated rapid cell loss until 1 year postoperatively , after which the rate of loss was no longer statistically significant.20 , 21 in our study , the vitrector pi had clean cuts with minimum pigment dispersion and a chance of being incomplete or getting blocked . 
 iop was stable throughout the 9 months of follow - up in both the groups . in the v4c group , this could be attributed not just to the centraflow technology , but also to the negligible pigment dispersion due to avoidance of pi . 
 none of our cases developed secondary glaucoma following excessive vault or pigment dispersion during the follow - up . in our study , 
 the icl vault was maintained at 9 months follow - up period.22 , 23 kamiya et al . 
 found the vault of the new central hole piol to be essentially equivalent to the vault of the conventional piol , suggesting that the presence of the central hole did not significantly affect the vault or the refractive accuracy . 
 kamiya et al.25 , 26 found the v4c icl with aquaport essentially equivalent in the optical quality variables to conventional icl implantation . 
 they suggested that the presence of the central artificial hole does not significantly affect the optical quality and the intraocular scattering after surgery . 
 other studies27 , 28 , 29 , 30 have also found good optical quality results with v4b and v4c icls . 
 studied piols and found that v4b icl implantation leads to decreased night vision performance with glare and haloes . 
 many studies33 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 37 , 38 have shown good visual performance and quality of life after icl implantation . in our study , patients in both groups experienced glare and haloes , but they were visually insignificant and non - annoying . 
 icl thus offers a safe , effective , and reversible option for correction of high myopia . 
 however , evaluation of the incidence of cataract formation and endothelial cell loss over a decade should be carried out . 
 the small sample size and unequal number of patients in the two groups precludes definite conclusion . 
 also , including both eyes of one patient in the study , limits the conclusion . 
 icl with a central hole offers an added advantage of annulling a pi and providing a stable iop . 
 however , a larger sample size undergoing v4c implantation with a longer follow - up is required for confirming the results .","however complications icl implantation cataract formation anterior subcapsular lens opacities typical butterfly cataract endothelial cell loss pigment dispersion intraocular pressure iop elevation secondary glaucoma reported complications expected increase time studies shown good acceptance profile icl models view increasing prevalence surgical procedure conducted study evaluate visual outcome complication rate safety indices vb vc icl models correction high myopia tertiary eye care center south india follow period months

"sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy known as rosai - dorfman disease ( rdd ) was first described in 1965 and identified as a distinct clinicopathologic entity in 196915 ) . 
 rdd is a rare histiocytic proliferative disorder of unknown etiology usually characterized by painless bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy3 ) . 
 the common clinical findings are fever , lymph node enlargement , leukocytosis , neutrophila , elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) , hypergammaglobulinemia and weight loss . 
 rdd is potentially systemic disease and may affect extranodal sites up to 43% of all rdd patients3 ) . 
 skeletal involvement as a sole manifestation of rdd is extremely rare , occurring in fewer than 2% of all rdd patients and arise most frequently in long bones such as tibia , femur , humerus , clavicle and bones of the hands2 ) . 
 we present a rare case of thoracic vertebrae compression fracture due to extranodal rdd without lymphadenopathy . 
 a 15-year - old man presented with intermittent midthoracic back pain for about 6 months after slip down during basketball . 
 he had no other symptoms such as fever , chills , malaise and lymph node enlargement . 
 results of routine hematologic and biochemical laboratory tests include esr and c - reactive protein ( crp ) showed within reference ranges . 
 a plain radiological examination of thoracic spine revealed collapse of t6 vertebrae with thoracic kyphosis and osteolytic lesion of t12 vertebra body(fig . 
 1a ) . magnetic resonance ( mr ) image of thoracic spine demonstrated collapse of t6 vertebrae with mild cord compression . 
 the lesions involving t6 and t12 vertebral body showed slightly high signal intensity in t2-weighted mr images ( fig . 
 1b - d ) and homogenous enhancement in t1-weighted mr images after the administration of gadolinium(fig . 
 1e - g ) . preoperative computed tomography ( ct ) scan showed near complete collapse of t6 vertebra body and osteolytic lesion of t12 vertebra . 
 2 ) increased tracer activity was shown at the t6 , t12 vertebra and epiphysis in whole body bone scan(fig . 
 1h ) the patient underwent a total laminectomy of t6 , left - sided facetectomy at t6/7 , removal of bone tumor , anterior reconstruction with mesh and pedicle screw fixation at t5 and t7 for pathologic confirmation and stabilization . 
 he was discharged from hospital at postoperative 5 days without complications and additional medications except some pain killers . 
 histopathologic study of the lesion revealed fibro - osseous tissue showing focal infiltration of large histiocytes representing emperipolesis . 
 these histiocytes were positive for cd68 and s-100 , but negative for cd1a in immunochemistry study , that is compatible for rdd(fig . 
 3 ) . a follow - up ct scan of thoracolumbar spine at one year after operation presented good status of bone fusion on t6 vertebra and bone formation of t12 vertebra body compared with preoperative ct scan that could be considered self - regression ( fig . 
 the present case is a rare example of compression fracture caused by isolated extranodal rdd involved the thoracic spine without lymphadenopathy . 
 rdd typically affects the bilateral cervical lymph nodes causing painless lymphadenopathy characterized by fever , lymph node enlargement , leukocytosis , neutrophila , elevation of esr , hypergammaglobulinemia and weight loss . 
 most patients with rdd are in their second or third decade of life and there is predominant in males and african - americans3 ) . 
 the etiology of rdd remains unknown ; however it is implied that dysfunction of the immune system and an autoimmune process or viral infection such as epsteine - barr virus and human herpes virus type 6 might be the causative factors in some former studies7,9,10 ) . in general , 
 the common extranodal sites include skin , upper respiratory tract , and bone3 ) . skeletal involvement as 
 a sole manifestation of rdd is extremely rare , occurring in fewer than 2% of all rdd patients and usually occurs in the long bones such as tibia , femur , humerus , clavicle and bones of the hands or skull , and is multiple . some cases that involved spine were reported in former studies . 
 some cases of rdd with intraspinal involvement in the form of intradural or epidural mass lesions causing neurologic deficit due to spinal cord compression1,8,16 ) , and vertebra body involvement4,5,14 ) were reported . 
 compression fracture due to spinal involvement of rdd had not been reported to the best our knowledge . 
 rdd is a rare diagnosis with a variety of imaging manifestations13 ) , so usually requires histology for diagnosis . 
 skeletal lesions of rdd are typically intramedullary osteolytic with either poorly or sharply defined margins and are rarely sclerotic , that can be confused radiographically with langerhans cell histiocytosis ( lch ) , eosinophilic granuloma or other lymphocyte proliferative diseases3,11 ) . 
 the lesion presents low or isosignal intensity on t1- and t2-weighted mr images and intense homogenous enhancement with contrast in most cases , but mr images can be various1 ) . 
 spinal rosai - dorfman disease similarly tends to be confused with meningioma when presenting as dural disease or as metastatic disease of another cause when presenting as vertebral body disease13 ) . 
 the differential diagnosis of a primary bone rosai - dorfman disease includes more common lesions , such as bacterial osteomyelitis , fungal infections such as histoplasmosis and langerhans cell histiocytosis . 
 special studies such as histochemistry , immunohistochemistry , and microbiologic cultures can be very useful to reach the correct diagnosis . 
 both histiocytes of rdd and lch are positive for cd68 and s100 in immunochemistry but histiocytes of rdd are negative for cd1a . 
 rdd has a typical finding in histopathologic studies , that is emperioplesis ; a phenomenon of phagocytosis of intact lymphocytes , plasma cells , erythrocytes or neutrophils . 
 previous studies for treatment of rdd concluded that most patients with rdd do not require specific therapy and can expect spontaneous regression6,12 ) . 
 if the vital organ is compressed or other life threatening manifestations are existed due to direct nodal or extranodal involvement , surgical debulking and/or radiotherapy can be considered12 ) . 
 other treatment modalities such as chemotherapy including methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurin , high - dose alphainterferon , steroid or antiviral drugs had been attempted for treatment of rdd . 
 standardized guidelines for surgical treatment have not yet been established nor have the indications for a surgical approach . 
 the performed operative technique was not different from that used to treat thoracic vertebrae fractures . 
 for this case , it is widely accepted that the goal of surgery for thoracic compression fractures is decompression of the neural elements , correction of spinal deformities , and fusion with stabilization . 
 we identified bone formation of t12 vertebra body in the follow - up ct scan of thoracolumbar spine at one year after operation , that could be considered to be resolved spontaneously . 
 skeletal involvement of rdd is unusual and sole manifestation of spine vertebra is extremely rare . 
 if the young adult or adolescent have compression of vertebra body , rdd can be considered as our case . 
 because of its rarity , various clinical manifestations and radiologic findings , it was difficult to differentiate from other disease such as langerhans cell histiocytosis or eosinophilic granuloma on radiologic study alone , so pathologic confirmation was needed . 
 as some former reports did , we could identify that rdd generally has benign clinical course and can be resolved itself .","present rare case thoracic vertebrae compression fracture due extranodal rdd without lymphadenopathy

 one of the major effects of sleep deprivation on the brain is to produce memory deficits in learning paradigms that are dependent on the hippocampus25 . in this study , we have identified a molecular mechanism by which brief sleep deprivation alters hippocampal function . 
 sleep deprivation selectively impaired camp / pka - dependent forms of synaptic plasticity6 in the hippocampus , reduced camp signaling , and increased activity and protein levels of phosphodiesterase-4 ( pde4 ) , an enzyme that degrades camp . treatment with pde inhibitors rescued the sleep deprivation - induced deficits in camp signaling , synaptic plasticity , and hippocampus - dependent memory . 
 these findings demonstrate that brief sleep deprivation disrupts hippocampal function by interfering with camp signaling through increased pde4 activity . 
 thus drugs that enhance camp signaling may provide a novel therapeutic approach to counteract the cognitive effects of sleep deprivation ."
"uncontrolled bleeding remains major challenge , responsible for 40% trauma - related deaths , which could be prevented by timely intervention . in blunt trauma , extent of hemorrhage 
 can not be determined by physical examination , as vital signs may not give a clear picture in all the patients , especially young healthy once . 
 although abnormal vital signs does indicate shock but the absence of abnormality does not exclude hypoperfusion in trauma patients . 
 decision - making is difficult , regarding surgical intervention to treat injuries hidden from physical examination . 
 these patients are intensely vasoconstricted and may suffer end organ ischemia even with normal systolic blood pressure ( sbp ) . 
 although shock index ( si ) can be a useful parameter in acute hemorrhage , but it still needs more study in its support to be better than simple vital sign analysis . 
 blood ammonia has been shown to be elevated in hemorrhagic shock in animals and humans . 
 intestinal bacterial enzymes acting on it produces ammonia which is freely diffusible and moreover liver in not fit for detoxification of ammonia . 
 we investigated the significance of ammonia levels estimation in blunt trauma abdomen patients to predict internal hemorrhage , complications and correlated with need of intervention . 
 one hundred blunt trauma abdomen patients ( > 12 years old ) presented in trauma ward / emergency department of tertiary care hospital were included in the study .

 a maximum number of patients ( 78% ) were below the age of 40 years suggesting this age group people are more outgoing and rash drivers making them more prone to accidents . 
 male preponderance ( 93% ) noted in our study is higher than earlier studies , may be reflecting indian culture where male member of the family being breadwinner , needs to travel more than females . 
 the routine evaluation of blunt trauma abdomen patients includes various clinical parameters , physical examination , radiological and laboratory findings . 
 increased ammonia levels as observed in our study could itself be danger signal in these patients as it is sign of blood in abdominal cavity due to blunt trauma . intestinal bacterial enzymes acting on it produces ammonia which is freely diffusible and moreover liver in not fit for its detoxification as hemorrhage decreases hepatic blood flow through portal vein causing dysoxia of cells 
 . increased ammonia levels have been reported in animal hemorrhagic shock and in few human studies as well . 
 cutoff value for ammonia was also calculated to maximize sensitivity and specificity in identifying patients requiring intervention . 
 the purpose of this study was to augment the diagnostic accuracy of routine clinical assessment of such patient . 
 high ammonia levels in bleeding patients ( group i ) correlated well with si as 88.7% of these patients had si > 0.9 , i.e. , having potentially severe trauma requiring immediate treatment . 
 other workers have also reported similar si in bleeding patients . although si can be useful clinical parameter in acute hemorrhage which depicts severity of situation in heterogeneous patients presented in emergency but it still needs more study in its support to be single reliable parameter . 
 five patients died in group i had high ammonia levels ( 87.4 mol / l ) at admission . 
 high ammonia itself is toxic and can cause various complications , so it must be diagnosed and treated as early as possible . 
 moreover , trauma patient loses lots of valuable time in reaching trauma center , but once reached the hospital , they need to be diagnosed correctly and quickly . 
 biochemical marker which is time and cost effective such as ammonia estimation can predict need of intervention in these patients and best treatment can be provided in the golden hour .

"x - linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata ( cdpx2 , omim 302960 ) is an inheritable systemic disease and is characterized by skeletal , ophthalmologic , and cutaneous manifestations . in the late seventies , rudolph happle reported a female and brilliantly recognized a group of published patients with chondrodysplasia punctata whose mosaic phenotype and sex rate corresponded with an x - linked dominant pattern of inheritance . in 1999 , the gene emopamil binding protein ( ebp ) was identified and associated with cdpx2 , so called conradi - hnermann - happle syndrome . 
 the ebp gene is located on the short arm of the x chromosome ( xp11.22-p11.23 ) and spans 7 kb of genomic dna , containing five exons coding a mature transcript of 1 kb which is ubiquitously expressed . 
 this protein consists of 230 amino acids and four transmembrane domains , it has a molecular weight of 27 kda and it is implicated in cholesterol biosynthesis . 
 cutaneous lesions in cdpx2 usually start as erythematous scaly plaques following the lines of blaschko that fade over time , and some patients may be born with congenital erythroderma . 
 while cdpx2 may exhibit variable phenotypes , psoriasiform skin lesions are exceptional and histopathologic investigations of psoriasiform skin lesions show epidermal hyperproliferation in addition to ichthyotic retention hyperkeratosis . in this report , a case of a 12-year - old girl diagnosed with x - linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata with a psoriasiform phenotype is reported with genetical confirmation . 
 we discuss here a rare clinical presentation which helps in better depict this rare genodermatosis and on the lack of correlation between phenotype and genotype in this disease . 
 a 12-year - old girl , who had been born with congenital erythroderma , had a 4-month history of linear and whorled inflammatory cutaneous lesions on her trunk , leg , and arms . 
 extensively distributed thickly adherent scaling had been developed at the age of one , and continued since then . 
 the patient had been born at term following a normal pregnancy and delivery and family history was unremarkable . 
 she displayed growth retardation , bilateral conductive hearing , and unilateral congenital cataract in her right eye . 
 she exhibited short stature with asymmetric shortening of her limbs , being her right arm shorter than her left . 
 dysmorphic facial features with frontal bossing , flat nasal bridge , and a depressed tip of the nose were observed . 
 dermatological examination revealed brown streaky hyperkeratotic plaques with thickly adherent scaling located along blaschko 's lines . 
 also , erythematous scaling and guttate lesions were observed on her trunk , arms , and legs . 
 there were patchy areas of scarring alopecia on frontal and temporal regions of the scalp and lateral regions of eyebrows . 
 dorsal and lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging showed scoliosis deformity , height losses of the t8 vertebrae left half and l3 , l4 vertebral the right halves ( tethered cord ) . 
 clinical features of the patient with conradi  hnermann  happle syndrome ( x - linked dominant chondrodysplasia punctata ) genomic dna of the patient was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes via a conventional phenol - chloroform method . 
 exons 1 - 5 and the intronic splicing regions from the ebp gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) as previously described . 
 the reaction was conducted in a 2720 thermal cycler ( applied biosystems , foster city , ca , u.s.a . ) . 
 automatic sequencing was performed with the abi prism 310 genetic analyzer ( applied biosystems ) . 
 we identified a previously reported ebp mutation , c. 440 g > a ( p.r147h ) in the patient , but not in her parents [ figure 2 ] . according to the clinical and laboratory findings 
 , the diagnosis of conradi - hnermann - happle syndrome was established . a skin biopsy of one of the guttate , erythematous , and scaling plaques revealed retention hyperkeratosis , parakeratosis , acanthosis with regular elongation of rete ridges , capillary proliferation , and mononuclear cell infiltration in papillary dermis , being this consistent with a psoriasiform pattern . 
 the pedigree and dna sequencing showed a heterozygous mutation c. 440 g > a resulting in p.r147h in ebp gene 
 in conradi - hnermann - happle syndrome , cutaneous findings are remarkable and characterized by hyperkeratotic lesions on an erythematous background following the blaschko 's lines . 
 bruch et al . described a unique adult patient presenting both with ichthyotic and pustular psoriasiform lesions together . 
 later , in a large spanish series , a patient with ichthyosis in a psoriasiform pattern was reported with the genetic analysis showed c. 187c > t ( p.arg63x ) de novo mutation . 
 we here present an exceptional case of cdpx2 with psoriasiform and ichthyotic skin lesions together in an adolescent , the first case from tunisia . 
 histopathological features of guttate , erythematous , and scaling plaques followed a psoriasiform pattern . in 1999 , the gene ebp was identified and associated with the conradi - hnermann - happle syndrome ( xp11.22-p11.23 ) . to date , about 70 different mutations in the ebp gene have been described related with this disease . 
 we found a c.(440 g > a ) missense de novo mutation in the ebp gene ( p.arg147his ) , placed in the second endoplasmic reticulum domain ( er2 ) of the protein . 
 the unique case of cdpx2 with a similar phenotype to ours displayed a c.(187c > t ) , p.arg63x nonsense mutation , which had also been described in two patients with typical skin phenotype of cdpx2 . 
 the c. 440 g seems to be a nucleotide with particularly high mutational susceptibility within the ebp gene , a hot spot . 
 on the other hand , the clinical phenotype associated with this mutation has been variable , which subscribes the lack of correlation between genotype and phenotype in this disease . 
 although the relationship between the various genotypes and phenotypes in conradi - hnermann - happle syndrome has not been fully elucidated , detailed clinical and molecular analyses are helpful for providing data to be used in genetic counseling . 
 our case expands the clinical phenotypic variation in cdpx2 and further demonstrates the lack of correlation between genotype and phenotype in this disease . 
 unique additional clinical manifestations like plaque - type psoriasis may present with different mutations . conradi - hunermann - happle may represent extensive plaque - type psoriasis in adolescent patients .","gene emopamil binding protein ebp identified associated cdpx called conradi hnermann happle syndrome

"planning , evaluating , and budget allocation for prevention programs are contingent upon estimating the size of their target groups . 
 population size estimation of the target groups in some context , such as hiv / aids , always entail numerous challenges in countries where such diseases are concentrated in specific sub - populations with stigmatized behaviors & characteristics ( e.g. : injecting drug users ) ( 15 ) . 
 traditional sampling methods that are used to estimate the size of these high risk populations , including multiplier , capture - recapture , etc . 
 , are very complicated , if not impossible , since locating people with high risk behaviors is difficult , and approaching them directly can greatly reduce response reliability ( 510 ) . estimating social network size of a representative sample , through a general population survey , and asking participants questions about specific high - risk behaviors among their acquaintances ( 1113 ) is one of the best means of gathering information on the sizes of such populations , also called hidden or hard - to - count populations due to the fact that it is not possible to calculate their sizes through regular , direct methods ( 14 ) 
 one such method that has held the interest of researchers for the past decade is network scale - up ( nsu ) ( 6 ) . in this method , 
 the average social network size of the respondents ( shown by c ) is used as a prerequisite for estimating the size of a high risk population in the society ( shown by e ) based on the mean number of persons with high risk behavior known by respondents ( shown by m ) ( 15 ) . in the past two decades 
 , several studies in different countries including the united states , ukraine , brazil , moldova , rwanda , japan , china , and thailand have used this method to determine social network sizes as a pre - requisite for estimating high risk population sizes . 
 this difference points to the need for local studies to determine this value and its determinants ( 1421 ) . in iran , the estimated social network size on a national scale is between 308 and 380 . 
 however , tehran , as a megacity and the capital of iran , has unique demographic , cultural , and social features , special inter - individual relationship patterns , and different subpopulation proportions . 
 in addition , due to the migration of different ethnic groups to this city , various ethnic networks have been formed ( 22 ) . therefore to observe these different characteristics and the technical considerations which are recommended in the nsu method , 
 the present study was designed to examine the social network size of the tehran province residents and the demographic factors affecting it in order to prepare the grounds for estimating the size of hidden populations . 
 the social network size was estimated using an indirect approach , that is , respondents were asked how many persons they knew in a certain sub - population within the society , and estimations were made based on the respondents answers . the term  knowing a person  has a specific definition in this study , and involves a certain time span and space ( 23 , 24 ) ; therefore by saying a knows b , it is understood that a knows b by name and face ; a can visit , call or email b whenever he / she wants , and vice versa . moreover , 
 a has contacted b by phone , email or in person at least once within the past 2 years , and b is a resident of tehran province ( 2527 ) . for the total sample size 1029 , we selected 829 persons from tehran and 200 from robat karim , the capital of robat karim county in tehran provincein 2012 . 
 the city of tehran was divided into 5 geographical zones : north , south , east , west , and center and the sample size were divided proportional to the population size of these five zones . 
 sampling was done in crowded areas , such as streets and parks ; individuals were selected through convenience sampling , and questions were asked in the form of street interviews . 
 all participants were 18 or older , and had been residents of tehran province for the past five years . upon entering the survey , 
 participants were briefed on the study objectives , and their informed consent was obtained . in order to determine the social network size , participants were asked questions regarding the number of people in their personal networks using the indirect method , that is , they were asked how many people they each knew in specific subpopulations . after coordination with the ministry of health and the statistical center of iran , twenty - three known populations with clear and available provincial level statistics were selected to be used in this study . in order to improve estimation accuracy , and in view of the findings of similar studies ( 20 , 28 ) , several considerations were taken into account in preparing the final list of the known populations to be used in the present study ; for instance , the size of all selected populations was between 0.1% and 4% of the total population of tehran province . 
 moreover , we excluded populations that could potentially induce a transmission error in the estimations for which there was no practical correction method . 
 popularity of names in the past three decades was observed in assigning names , and more popular names were used at an almost even distribution . out of the twenty - three initial subpopulations , 
 thirteen were eventually used in the study : first graders , high school graduates , university applicants , university students , married people , divorced people , those who had had normal vaginal deliveries ( nvd ) , those who had had cesarean sections ( c / s ) , primary school staff , people with the first names hamed , abulfazl , sara and marjan . in this study , social network size was estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) method and the equation below : 
 c^i  =  j  mijj  ej.t where c^i is the social network size of the respondent i , mij is the number of people that i knows in the known population j , ej is the real size of the known population j , the statistical information for which is available through previous censuses or surveys , and t is the total size of the general population in the survey area ( 11 , 13 ) . to compute the 95% confidence intervals of the social network size , standard error c was calculated through the formula below : ( 29 ) 
 se  ci = tcijej this simple model will only work if the following strong assumptions exist ( 11 , 24 ) : 
 all respondents have equal opportunity to know each member of the subpopulations under study.all respondents are fully informed about their own social network.all respondents can recall the number of their acquaintances in the subpopulations under study quickly and clearly . 
 all respondents can recall the number of their acquaintances in the subpopulations under study quickly and clearly . 
 violation of each of these assumptions brings about errors in the results achieved through the network scale - up method . 
 one thing that can violate assumption a is the barrier effect , which pertains to barriers causing some respondents to know the subpopulations in the study with stronger or weaker possibility . 
 transmission error , on the other hand , can violate assumption b , and that is when all people in a given person s network are similarly likely not to be aware of him / her belonging in a subpopulation . 
 estimation effect is another factor that can violate assumption c , and it is due to a lack of precise knowledge of certain details about the people in a high risk social network . in order to control various effects and errors that can bias estimations , 
 the following methods were employed to investigate the sources for these potential errors : 1 ) back estimation of each of the known populations to determine the best groups for estimating the ultimate social network size , and 2 ) variable stratification of the study samples , carrying out all analyses independently in each subgroup , and comparing results with that for the total sample . 
 moreover , acquaintances who were among the respondents social network but were not residents of tehran province were eliminated from all estimations . in order to perform the first correction , a preliminary calculation of the social network size 
 was done , the size of each known population was assumed unknown ( e ) , and then the size of each subpopulation was estimated through the formula below : at this point , the estimate / real ratio ( e / r ratio ) for each population was calculated by dividing the estimated population sizes by the real sizes throughout the province . 
 the next step was to eliminate the first known population in which this ratio was not between 0.5 and 2 . 
 after removing the population in which this ratio was the farthest away from the above - mentioned range of 0.5 and 2 , the whole process was repeated one more time . 
 the procedure was repeated for each of the populations , starting with the farthest outlier , until none of the calculated ratios was outside of this range . 
 the final social network size was computed from the average social network size calculated for people in this stage ( ci ) ( 14 , 24 , 30 ) . in the end , 
 the effect of various demographic and background factors on the social network size of the residents of tehran province was analyzed using a linear regression model . 
 a total of 1029 people were interviewed in this study ; 46.7% participants were male . 
 the majority ( 42.3% ) was in the 18  25 year age group ; the last educational degree of most participants was high school graduate or bachelor s degree , and they were mostly university students ( table 1 ) . 
 demographics of study participants using the thirteen known populations , the social network size was estimated at 200.4 ( ci95% : 188.3 , 212.5 ) , which was used for the back estimation of the known populations in this study . 
 the pearson correlation coefficient between the real and estimated sizes of these known populations was 0.44 ( p value = 0.12 ) . 
 the e / r ratio was approximately 1 in all but three of the subpopulations ; exceptions were first graders , and nvd , c / s where e / r ratios were 0.40 , 0.43 , and 0.3 respectively , and therefore the social network size of tehran province was estimated by eliminating the subpopulations c / s , first graders and nvds in that order . 
 table 2 represents the estimated social network size after excluding each of the above subpopulations , as well as the e / r ratio for populations whose sizes have been calculated based on the estimated network sizes that continue to be out of the desired range . having eliminated c / s , primary school and nvd groups , the estimated cs were 220.8 , 243.4 and 259.1 respectively . 
 in addition , the correlation between the real and estimated sizes of remaining groupwas improved significantly in every steps ( r= 0.32 based on groups , 0.51 , 0.72 and 0.82 by dropping c / s , primary school and nvd groups respectively ) . estimate / real ( e / r ) ratio & estimate - real correlation changes after stepwise excluding the known populations with out of range e / r ratio table 3 demonstrates results of applying the back estimation method to subpopulations with estimated sizes within the acceptable range that were used in the final network size estimations . 
 back estimations and e / r ratios of all populations are presented in table 4 . 
 known populations , source of data , back estimation of their population sizes , and the e / r ratio e / r ratio in separate estimations of social network size for men and women ( before and after excluding the three out of range e / r ratio known groups ) figure 1 represents the scatter plot of the real against estimated sizes of the thirteen known populations , and the same measures after excluding the three abovementioned subpopulations . 
 the final network size estimated by using the remaining ten subpopulations was 259.1 ( ci95% : 242.2 , 276 ) . 
 real  estimate scatter plot of known population sizes ( before and after excluding the three out of range e / r ratio known groups ) in the univariate analysis , social network size was significantly associated with gender ( p=0.01 ) , age ( p<0.001 ) , and occupation ( p<0.001 ) . 
 men had larger networks comparing to women ( 291.8 versus 230.4 ) , and c in younger people was larger than that in older ones ( 328.5 versus 201.1 ) . 
 multivariate analysis showed that variables of gender and age impacted social network size ( table 5 ) . 
 age was also proved to have a significant impact on the respondents knowing the studied subpopulations ( p < 0.001 ) . comparison of social network size in different sub groups based on different background variables the possibility of knowing a person who had graduated from high school , participated in the university entrance exam , or been admitted into university in the past year was higher in the younger age group ( 56.6% , 63.4% and 39.3% respectively ) ( table 6 ) . 
 based on the findings of this study and by using the mle method , the social network size of the residents of tehran province was estimated at 259.1 which were calculated using 10 known populations with an e / r ratio between 0.5 and 2 . age and gender were determinants of peoples network sizes . 
 estimated network sizes were different in male and female respondents , and appropriate known populations used for c estimation in these two groups were not equal . 
 our experience showed that all subpopulations with known size were not appropriate to be used in the estimation of c. we dropped three sub - populations to improve the internal validity of our size estimations , which also used in other comparable studies ( 11 , 14 , 20 , 22 ) . by eliminating these 3 subpopulations , the social network size 
 the national study was primarily biased in a similar manner as well ( 22 ) . 
 therefore , estimation of c based on the size of some known subpopulations is a stepwise technique and has to be applied with some considerations ; otherwise the estimated c might have big bias . 
 the estimated sizes for known subpopulations c / s , nvd , and first graders were less than half the real sizes , and for the subpopulation of people with the first name marjan the estimated size was more than twice the actual size . 
 after all three subpopulations were eventually eliminated , the correlation coefficient was more than double ( 0.82 as opposed to 0.32 ) , and became statistically significant . 
 moreover , the estimations for the subpopulation marjan  a persian female first name- fit within the acceptable range , and was closer to 1 . 
 this indicated that the social network size estimated by using the ten remaining known populations would yield a more reliable estimate of hidden subpopulations too . 
 similar studies confirm likewise that elimination of populations with estimations outside of the range 0.5  1.5increases the correlation coefficient between back estimations and real sizes . 
 conducted a research in ukraine to estimate the number of idu s fsw s and msm . 
 of the 22 known populations used in this study , 13 fell within the acceptable e / r ratio range , and were used in the final network scale - up calculations . 
 the estimated sizes of known populations had a high correlation coefficient with the real sizes using the back estimation technique ( r = 0.912 ) , and this number reached 0.94 after nine of the known populations were eliminated ( 14 ) . in another study conducted on 1554 individuals in the u.s . 
 after elimination of two populations with a discrepancy between their real and estimated sizes , the correlation rose to 0.94 ( 11 ) . in the present study , 
 the average e / r ratio using thirteen known populations was calculated to be 1.17 . 
 removing each of the outliers brought this ratio closer to 1 , and after eliminating the 3 sub - populations mentioned earlier , the e / r ratio reached 1.09 . 
 this figure indicated an average overestimation of about 9% in the calculations . in the ukrainian study , 
 the e / r ratio was 1.65 , which denotes an overestimation of 65% in population size estimations ( 14 ) . 
 overestimation seems to be one of the common limitations of the network scale - up method with small subpopulations ( 11 , 30 ) . in the present study , 
 this problem occurred with the subpopulation of people with the first name marjan , which was the smallest subpopulation with only 0.12% of the total population of tehran province . 
 since nicknames are common in iran , this overestimation may be because the respondents network includes people called marjan who are registered in the census with a different name ; this can be true with several names . 
 after eliminating the c / s subpopulation , the e / r ratio for the subpopulation marjan fell within the acceptable range ( e / r = 2 ) , and after the two subpopulations nvd and first graders were removed , this ratio decreased even further ( e / r = 1.7 ) . 
 another common calculation error in the network scale - up method is underestimation of the size of large subpopulations ( 11 , 30 ) . 
 the largest subpopulations used in this study were c / s , first graders , married people , and university applicants . 
 the first two were underestimated as expected , while the other two had more accurate estimations , probably on account of a more satisfactory transmission and the respondents being more informed on these properties due to the significance that iranians attribute to marriage and university education . 
 study on se - roprevalence in the united states , it is difficult for respondents to estimate the number of acquaintances they have in large subpopulations ( 11 ) . 
 in addition to the estimation error in the c / s subpopulation , another explanation for this group having the lowest e / r ratio ( 0.34 ) and an e / r ratio lower than 0.5 for the nvd group is transmission error . 
 the similar natures of these two subpopulations as well as their connection to gender suggested that respondents gender impacts their awareness of nvd or c / s occurring within their social networks . in order to assess the validity of this theory , 
 network size estimations and back estimations for populations were performed based on the respondents gender . based on our findings , 
 the e / r ratios for known populations were different in male and female res pondents ( table 4 ) . 
 the e / r ratios were out of range for the subpopulations c / s , nvd , and first graders when estimated through the networks of male respondents , but this limitation did not exist in case of female respondents . 
 the difference seems to be understandable considering the nature of these subpopulations and the iranian culture : an iranian male respondent would be less likely to be aware of childbirth conditions or first graders in his social network compared to a female respondent in a similar situation . in the ukrainian study , similar circumstances were encountered when estimating the number of militiamen , since there was a higher likelihood for male respondents to know someone in this subpopulation on account of their cultural status and social relations compared to women ( 77% vs. 68% ) . therefore , using the militiamen subpopulation to estimate the social network size leads to different results in male and female respondents ( 14 ) . 
 barrier effect is another significant factor that can compromise the estimation of population sizes in the network scale - up method . 
 one common barrier , which could be a concern in the present study , is the respondents age . 
 those in the 18  25 year group were more likely than others to know someone in the subpopulations high school graduates , university applicants , and university students , considering how these categories are age - related . 
 based on the results shown in table6 however , barrier effect did not affect the results of this study . 
 this is probably because the 18 - 25 year old group is relatively larger in the general population , and our 18 - 25 year old group was proportionately larger too . in the ukrainian study 
 , the two subpopulations polish and moldavian were removed due to the risk of barrier effect and consequent estimation errors . in the final stage of the present study , 
 the remaining ten subpopulations were used to estimate the social network size at 259.1 , and this was used as the base for estimating the known population sizes with the most suitable e / r ratio and the highest correlation with their true sizes . 
 this number was smaller compared to similar study in the country , carried out by shokoohi et al . in kerman province in 2010 ( c = 303 ) . 
 their study was performed on 500 men between 18 and 45 years of age , and the data were collected through interviews . 
 the difference between the social network sizes of the two provinces of tehran and kerman seems to be due to the lifestyle specific to metropolitan areas and capital cities that somehow limits social relationships ; one other reason may be that the kerman study was restricted to male samples , who are expected to have more social contacts and consequently larger networks than females in a city like kerman ( 27 ) . 
 two estimates were computed by entering 23 known groups in the study using regression - based ( c=308 ) and ratio - based ( c=380 ) methods . according to their results , the ratio - based method , which is also used in the present study , is the recommended approach because of higher internal validity and prediction validity ( 22 ) . 
 the ratio of the population size to the total tehran population was beyond the range of 0.1% to 4.0% for 10 of the 23 known groups in the national study ; differences in population compositions and their effect on results can partly explain the different estimates in these two studies . 
 moreover , unique social , cultural , political , and economic processes in tehran have created a different pattern of social interactions that restricts inter - individual relationships and limits the social network size . 
 social science studies also confirm that in recent years , the nature of urban development in megaci - ties such as tehran has entailed loosening in social ties . 
 this is due to concentration of population in metropolitan areas and absence of alternative social practices ( 31 ) . in the ukrainian study , 
 the social network size was estimated at 202 using a network scale - up approach and the mle method , which was also employed by the present study ( 27 ) . in a 2012 study conducted in japan by ezoe et al . with the purpose of estimating the msm population , 
 the network size was estimated to be 363.5 regardless of gender , with 174 being male . 
 out of the initial ten known populations used in this study , only three were eventually used to estimate the social network size in the pilot stage : male fire fighter , policemen , and military personnel . 
 of the seven eliminated populations , five were removed on account of estimation error , that is , their estimated sizes were not consistent with their real sizes , and two were removed due to transmission error ( 20 ) . 
 the social network size was estimated at approximately 291 in the united states , as shown in the 2001 study by mccarty et al . , using four separate national sets of samples . 
 the study used the network scale - up method on 29 known populations , three of which were similar to the subpopulations in the present study and those were : first names , people who gave birth within the last year , and victims of car accidents ( 24 ) . the social network size estimated by killworth et al . 
 was 286 , which is larger than the present study , and this may be due to the numerous cultural and social differences between iran and the united states ( 11 ) . 
 although in the kerman study , there was no significant relationship between the social network size and any of the demographic factors ( age , education , marital status , and occupation ) ( 27 ) ; the results of the present study showed that men comparing to women and younger people comparing older ones had a significantly larger social network , which seems understandable on account of cultural and social considerations . 
 in the national study and the chinese study , the social network sizes of men and younger people was larger compared to those of women and other age groups , and this is due to men and young people having wider social circles ( 21 , 22 ) . 
 married people had smaller social networks compared to single people in the two studies mentioned above ; this difference was found to exist in the present study as well , although the difference between these two groups was statistically not significant in tehran province ( 248.8 versus 270.1 ) . in this study , there were limitations associated with the network scale - up method . 
 firstly , it is unrealistic to expect accurate and flawless estimations , because although there is a precise and specific definition for the term  knowing a person 
 , data collected on social networks is self - reported . in minimize this limitation , 
 the present study attempted to use known populations that were easily recognizable by all respondents , and had clear and uniform definitions for all members of the society . 
 furthermore , the time span for the questions was the past year so that respondents could remember the details with fewer errors . 
 another issue , which is quite unavoidable , is lack of definite boundaries separating many subpopulations in the respondents points of view . 
 researchers are limited to subpopulations for which official statistics exist , and these subpopulations have been assigned specific definitions that are not necessarily consistent with those of various members of the society . 
 we intended to select a representative sample of general population in order to minimize different types of selection and information biases . 
 although it was not a fully random sample of whole community and there are some methodological considerations , based on the existing experiences in iran and the result of a methodological study that was performed for comparing three popular sampling method in this type of studies ( street - based , telephone - based and home - based interviews ) in this regard , it seems street - based sampling from deferent geographical zones would be a feasible sampling scheme which was used in the national study as well . 
 based on the above explanation , it seems that the social network size of tehran s residents is different not only with similar studies in other countries but also with the results of national survey in iran , which might be mainly because of the special social and cultural pattern of communications among different communities . 
 we also showed that the c varies considerably in males and females , in young and old people . 
 therefore , local estimations for c in different sub - populations are needed to improve the accuracy of nsu estimations . 
 ethical issues ( including plagiarism , informed consent , misconduct , data fabrication and/or fal sification , double publication and/or submission , redundancy , etc . ) have been completely observed by the authors .","study social network size estimated using maximum likelihood estimation mle method equation ci j mijj ejt ci social network size respondent mij number people knows known population j ej real size known population j statistical information available previous censuses surveys total size general population survey area

"bites from venomous snakes kill more people in the developing world than some of the world 's better recognized and better studied neglected tropical diseases . 
 . though not all bites are by venomous snakes or result in poisoning , up to 2 million of these bites result in the injection of venom , with hundreds of thousands of significant injuries and as many as 94,000 to 125,000 deaths occurring primarily in india , southeast asia , and sub - saharan africa [ 2 , 3 ] . 
 the vast majority of snakebites occur in impoverished , rural populations with limited access to medical treatment . 
 mortality from snakebite is unequivocally linked to socioeconomic markers of poverty and even a successful hospital treatment can cause economic ruin . a recent study from the indian state tamil nadu analyzed how patients hospitalized for snakebite paid for their expenses : 40% took loans , 20% sold stored crops , 15% sold valuables 10% sold cattle , and many reported removing their children from school  all while incurring up to 12 years income worth of debt . 
 it is estimated that around 10,000 people die from snakebite each year in tamil nadu , alone , more than twice the total number of deaths claimed by landmines each year , worldwide [ 4 , 5 ] . 
 neostigmine is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( achei ) that is administered intravenously and is currently recommended by the who for the treatment of neurotoxic snakebite . 
 acetylcholinesterase inhibiting drugs such as neostigmine and edrophonium are thought to reduce the neuromuscular block from neurotoxic snakebite by increasing the amount of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction as it does in the treatment of myasthenia gravis or the reversal of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents [ 69 ] . 
 atropine or glycopyrrolate , in intravenous ( iv ) form , are usually coadministered with acheis to blunt the undesirable muscarinic effects of acheis . however , coadministration is not necessary in some clinical studies , for example , in myasthenia gravis patients receiving intranasal ( in ) administration for up to one year [ 10 , 11 ] . 
 interestingly , in neostigmine has been used to treat myasthenia gravis in several studies [ 1013 ] and we recently showed in a human study that it could reverse mivacurium - induced neuromuscular blockade by this route . 
 the present study tested the hypothesis that neostigmine , given in , would be an effective initial treatment of naja naja envenomed mice . 
 the early use of acheis leads to a considerable increase in the ld50 in mice and rats having undergone experimental envenomation [ 15 , 16 ] . 
 our study is distinguished from those by the replacement of parenteral neostigmine with topically applied in neostigmine . 
 the rationale for this study is that since neurotoxic snakebites often occur far from hospitals , by eliminating the need for injection ( e.g. , of parenteral neostigmine or intravenous antivenin ) , we may be able to shorten time to treatment and save lives . 
 the study was approved by the animal research committee of a contract research laboratory in hyderabad , india , an iacuc - certified laboratory and performed by a trained technician , a full - time dvm and one of us ( mrl ) who performed experiments at the facility . 
 unfractionated n. naja venom was purchased from sigma - aldrich ( st . louis , mo , usa ) ; neostigmine and atropine were purchased from besse medical ( ann arbor , mi , usa ) . 
 polyvalent antivenom ( vins bioproducts , andhra pradesh , india ) was available at all times in the event of accidental envenoming of staff . 
 a small pilot study was carried out to assess the potency of the reconstituted lyophilized n. naja venom to test if it was comparable to published reports of other commercially available unfractionated , frozen , or lyophilized n. naja venom at 0.3  mg / kg [ 15 , 1719 ] . 
 mice were pseudorandomized in batches of 5 with tails marked 1 to 5 stripes by sharpie felt tip pen to receive intraperitoneal ( ip ) injections of n. naja venom ( 2.5 ld50 , n = 20 ; 5 ld50 , n = 10 and 10 ld50 , n = 10 ) concomitantly with atropine , which blunts the muscarinic effects of neostigmine and has previously been shown to have no effect on ld50 when experimentally injected with snake venom . 
 the ip agents ( venom and atropine ) were adjusted for the weight of each individual mouse by the facility veterinarian and injected by a single technician who was not aware of the hypothesis and who also recorded the survival times . 
 animals received either 5  l of 0.5  mg / ml neostigmine or 5  l of saline by in administration by mrl . 
 animals in the 2.5 ld50 group received treatment or control 10 minutes after venom injection . in the 5 ld50 and 10 ld50 groups , animals received in neostigmine 1 - 2 minutes after venom injection . 
 preliminary studies the mice were already severely disabled by 10 minutes after experimental envenomation with the higher doses of venom and neostigmine did not appear to help . 
 animals were observed continuously for up to 12 hours and assessed for signs of toxicity including respiratory distress , loss of spontaneous locomotor activity with the only endpoints being time to death or recovery . 
 dead mice were removed immediately and tail - band number was recorded on a data sheet reflecting the mouse 's lot and individual band number as well as weight . 
 surviving animals were euthanized after 12 hours by the same technician who performed the experimental envenomation procedure . 
 the technician , however , was blinded to knowing which mice had been treated with in neostigmine or saline control . 
 data were analyzed using graphpad prism ( la jolla , ca ) and the p values presented in the figures were as calculated by nonparametric mann - whitney test . 
 envenomed mice were further characterized using a survival analysis that included censoring to account for the study being terminated at 12 hours ( 720 minutes ) after dosing . 
 to plot survival time on a single y - axis , the survival time data was normalized within each envenomation dose to the mean survival time of each control group and then multiplied by 100 . 
 because snakebites in the community can result in a highly variable amount of venom being delivered to the patient , we sought to determine whether in neostigmine could be effective in improving survival at several dosages of venom in our mouse model . 
 figures 1(a)1(c ) show the effects of neostigmine in mice envenomed with naja naja venom at various concentrations : 2.5 ld50 ( a ) , 5 ld50 ( b ) , and 10 ld50 ( c ) . 
 as described above , the rationale for using in neostigmine is to improve survival time from the moment of the snakebite . 
 these results support our idea that early in achei therapy could improve survival even after a potentially severe neurotoxic envenomation . 
 higher venom dosages resulted in earlier deaths , as expected , but for all dosages of venom , neostigmine provided a substantial and persistent window of increased survival . 
 envenomed mice died at an average of 193 minutes compared to 553 minutes ( p < 0.02 ) for the treatment group ( 10/15 were euthanized after the arbitrary cutoff of 6 hours , but were behaving completely normally ) . at the 5 ld50 venom dosage , survival was prolonged from a mean of 45 minutes in the control group to 196 minutes in the treatment group ( p = 0.01 ) . 
 likewise , at the 10 ld50 venom dosage , mean survival was prolonged from 30 to 175 minutes ( p < 0.02 ) . 
 findings reached statistical significance even after reanalysis excluding surviving outliers in the 5 ld50 and 10 ld50 groups . 
 most bites in humans are on the extremities , but we chose the ip route for consistency and to replicate elements of previously published mouse studies [ 1517 ] . due to limitations of funding , we only tried one type of experimental envenomation using a curare - like snake neurotoxin ; it is likely that the effects of in acheis will vary across different venom types . 
 venoms contain a multitude of toxic peptides and proteins and published ld50 ranges vary widely between cobra species , subspecies and route of delivery ( e.g. , subcutaneous , intravenous , or ip ) [ 15 , 1720 ] . mice and humans differ greatly in their sensitivity to the same drugs [ 21 , 22 ] , and only one set of neostigmine to atropine concentrations was used . 
 thus , as with all transitions from preclinical to clinical usage , dosages will need to be optimized for human use . 
 fortunately , the development of in neostigmine for the treatment of myasthenia gravis [ 1013 , 23 , 24 ] provides a substantial head start for this transition . 
 only a single dose of in neostigmine was administered , so it is not clear if mice would have survived longer with multiple treatments and no other acheis were tested . 
 the concentration of neostigmine was significantly lower than that has been used in human studies , though total dose was comparable and the drugs were not aerosolized but dropped on the nares [ 1014 ] . in the present study 
 , atropine was coadministered with in neostigmine through ip route . in previous mouse studies atropine 
 we anticipate that an anticholinergic agent such as atropine ( which can be administered in ) would potentially be administered with neostigmine to blunt untoward muscarinic effects of an achei should these effects be present with in achei formulations in a human study . 
 interestingly , in the year - long study by sghirlanzoni and colleagues , patients self - administering in neostigmine did not report any complications from in neostigmine . 
 broggini and colleagues tested the bioavailability of high dose in neostigmine compared to iv administration in healthy human adults without coadministration of atropine and did not note any serious adverse events . 
 the ip - absorption kinetics of atropine are more reliable and proven than the in absorption kinetics of atropine . 
 thus , if we had coadministered atropine in instead of ip , we would be faced with the confoundedness that perhaps differential survival depended on intersubject differences in atropine - absorption kinetics . 
 this confoundedness would be impossible to disambiguate from our central hypothesis in such a small study . 
 by contrast , if survival depended on differential in absorption kinetics ( of neostigmine ) , that simply serves to further support the central hypothesis that neostigmine is the critical variable , especially in light of gieu 's results showing that ip atropine did not materially alter survival from experimental ip cobra envenomation . 
 similarly , we did not attempt any skin hemorrhagic or myonecrosis activity assays , though no unusual bleeding was noted . 
 mice were only observed for neurological manifestations of envenomation such as convulsion , hind limb paralysis , and respiratory distress after injection of reconstituted venom . 
 muscle - contraction - dependent respiration is a necessary condition for life amongst all mammals and virtually all vertebrates . 
 the present finding builds on our earlier demonstration that in neostigmine could reverse paralysis in an awake , experimentally paralyzed human subject . to our knowledge , this is the first demonstration that a topically applied drug could reverse venom - induced neurotoxicity . 
 we previously showed that nasal neostigmine could reverse mivacurium - induced paralysis in an awake human . 
 together , these data provide proof - of - principle that venom - induced toxicity should be treatable in the out - of - hospital setting and provide early , life - saving interventions at low cost . 
 anil and colleagues showed that the mean time interval between bite and arrival to hospital was 4.5  h by which point the venom would have been entrenched at presynaptic axons . 
 rapid death from krait bite most often comes as a result of the alpha - toxin and diaphragmatic paralysis and airway obstruction could be delayed by early achei therapy , but to our knowledge this idea has never been tested . in mouse studies , guieu showed that among the drugs they tested only acheis consistently resulted in increases in naja venom ld50s while atropine had no effect on the ld50 . 
 similarly , flachsenberger   showed that at otherwise lethal doses , all animals survived as a result of early achei treatment following ip administration of adder ( acanthophis antarcticus ) venom . 
 flaschenberger further found that the expected survival time of animals subjected to even higher experimental venom doses was significantly extended . 
 these animal [ 15 , 16 ] and human morbidity and mortality studies suggest that if acheis can be administered during the initial , critical stage after envenomation there could be a survival benefit to human victims [ 16 , 2732 ] . 
 surprisingly , both the efficacy and optimal uses of antivenom and achei therapies for neurotoxic snakebite remain unproven even after decades of widespread use [ 2 , 14 , 3338 ] . 
 it has been argued that the development of more diverse and regionally specific antivenoms is the most cost effective means of combatting morbidity and mortality from snakebite in the developing world [ 3941 ] . 
 we argue that investment in repurposed , low - molecular - weight pharmaceuticals would be more cost effective in the long term because of their ease of use , heat stability , and safety profiles . in administration of neostigmine has the potential to provide snakebite victims with significantly increased access to an effective treatment for neurotoxic snakebite while suggesting a strategy for the development of topically administered antidotes to hemotoxic , cardiotoxic , and other complex envenomation in the future 
 . this type of innovation would save lives while significantly lowering the economic burden on individuals , families , communities , and governments . to date , no prospective human study has been done to analyze the effect of immediate achei administration in the setting of neurotoxic snakebite . 
 the primary aim of this pilot study was to test if early in administration of acheis and in principal any venom - inhibiting agent is plausible . 
 the results of this study suggest that this is the case and that significant further study of this and other strategies is warranted .","present study tested hypothesis neostigmine given would effective initial treatment naja naja envenomed mice

 most snakebite deaths occur prior to hospital arrival ; yet inexpensive , effective , and easy to administer out - of - hospital treatments do not exist . 
 acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can be therapeutic in neurotoxic envenomations when administered intravenously , but nasally delivered drugs could facilitate prehospital therapy for these patients . 
 we tested the feasibility of this idea in experimentally envenomed mice . 
 methods . 
 mice received intraperitoneal injections of naja naja venom 2.5 to 10 times the estimated ld50 and then received 5  l neostigmine ( 0.5  mg / ml ) or 5  l normal saline by nasal administration . 
 animals were observed up to 12 hours and survivors were euthanized . 
 results . 
 100% of control mice died . 
 untreated mice injected with 2.5 ld50 naja naja died at average 193 minutes after injection , while 10 of 15 ( 67% ) of treated mice survived and were behaviorally normal by 6 hours ( p < 0.02 ) . in the 5 ld50 group , survival was prolonged from 45 minutes to 196 minutes ( p = 0.01 ) and for 10 ld50 mice , survival increased from 30 to 175 minutes ( p < 0.02 ) . conclusion . 
 this pilot suggests that intranasal drugs can improve survival and is the first direct demonstration that such an approach is plausible , suggesting means by which treatment could be initiated before reaching the hospital . 
 further investigation of this approach to neurotoxic and other types of envenomation is warranted ."
"stroke is a kind of acute cerebrovascular disease characterized by high morbidity , disability and death rates . 
 it is reported that stroke has become one of the most frequently - occurring neurological injuries in usa and china , about 800,000 and 2,000,000 people every year respectively ( roger et al . , 2011 ) . 
 stroke includes ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke , and a large number of clinical studies and animal experiments have shown that the cerebral injury and ischemia - reperfusion injury caused by stroke are complex physiopathologic processes , involving toxic effects of excitatory amino acids , inflammatory reaction , oxidative stress , the generation of free radical , brain edema , neuronal apoptosis / death ( zhu et al . , 2015 ) . 
 although the mechanisms of the injury are diverse , our treatment theory of neuroprotective strategies mainly focus on two aspects : on the one hand , we can activate the endogenous protective mechanisms of patients bodies to protect the brain from injury ; on the other hand , it is advisable to try our best to minimize secondary brain injury and promote the recovery of the damaged tissues . for many years , people have been trying to understand and search effective treatments for stroke from every conceivable angle . for now , for ischemic stroke , thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy has become regular treatments ( mandava et al . , 2015 ) , and for hemorrhagic stroke , hematomas cleaning operation and the stable control of intracranial pressure are conductive to improve the prognosis of patients ( siler et al . , 2014 ) . in addition 
 , hypothermia has been considered to be a valuable clinical treatment for centuries ( thome et al . , 2005 ) , and 
 mild hypothermia ( 33 - 36c ) has been demonstrated to play neuroprotective role ( antonic et al . 
 its mechanisms mainly involve decreasing the metabolism rates of brain tissues and alleviating brain edema ( hobbs et al . , 2008 ) . 
 besides , a variety of methods are used for the treatment of stroke , including stroke unit , neuronal electrophysiological treatment , and even the possibility of psychological therapy ( pohjasvaara et al . , 1998 ; patel et al . , 2004 ; sheffler and chae , 2007 ) . 
 our previous studies suggested that pramipexole - induced hypothermia could effectively inhibit subarachnoid hemorrhage - induced early brain injury in rats via phosphoinositide 3-kinase / protein kinase b / glycogen synthase kinase-3 signaling pathway ( ma et al . , 2016 ) . 
 however , the present theories for stroke are still unsatisfactory and needed to be further improved , although the development of evidence - based medicine is ongoing . 
 specifically , in recent years , medical gas , including oxygen and hydrogen , have become issues of concern . 
 no matter ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke , the final outcome is hypoxic - ischemic damage of brain tissues , hyperbaric oxygen therapy can significantly increase the oxygen pressure and blood oxygenation content , accelerate collateral circulation to protect neurons , repair the damaged microvessels , stimulate angiogenesis and neurogenesis , and accordingly , play neuroprotective role ( gill and bell , 2004 ; sanchez , 2013 ) . 
 hydrogen has also been found play roles of anti - inflammation , anti - oxygenation and anti - apoptosis when a stroke occurs . 
 hydrogen sulfide ( h2s ) has always been considered as a toxic gas with its odor of rotten eggs , because it could play the cytotoxic role through inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase and mitochondrial respiration ( furne et al . , 2001 ; 
 have suggesting that h2s is an another important gaseous signaling molecule in biological systems following nitric oxide ( no ) and carbon monoxide and in central nervous system ( cns ) ( wang , 2002 ; li and moore , 2008 ) , a larger number of researches have shown that it has neuroprotective effects as neurotransmitter ( kimura and kimura , 2004 ; whiteman et al . , 2004 ) , and 
 researchers hope to provide a new direction for the therapy of stroke through studying h2s . after the endogenous h2s 
 was first found in the brain in the end of 20 century ( warenycia et al . , 1989 ) , researchers gradually found that the production of h2s in cns predominantly involve three particular enzymes : cystathionine--synthase ( cbs ) , cystathionine--lyase ( cse ) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase ( 3-mst ) , which could convert to h2s from l - cysteine ( cys ) in combination with cysteine aminotransferase ( cat ) ( kolluru et al . 
 , 2013 ; jung and jeong , 2014 ) . that is to say , cse 
 primarily induce the production of h2s in cardiovascular system , while cbs mainly is responsible for producing h2s in the cns ( qu et al . 
 , 2008 ; kimura et al . , 2012 ) , and cbs uses cys and homocysteine ( hcy ) that have been known the risk factors for stroke and heart disease as substrates ( abe and kimura , 1996 ; chen et al . 
 interestingly , although there are amounting evidences showing that h2s participates in the regulation of neuronal function and signaling pathway , concerning the neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects of h2s still remains controversial . in our review , we will discuss the main mechanism and the possible role of h2s in stroke . 
 because of its toxicity , people have always thought that the concentration of h2s in animal tissues is very low for a long time . 
 however , as what we have known , h2s could be produced endogenously , and further studies indicate that h2s could exist in mammalian tissues at very high concentration , up to 50160 mm ( goodwin et al . , 1989 ; warenycia et al . , 
 1989 ) , which is dramatically higher than that in the peripheral blood ( 046 mm ) ( zhao et al . , 2003 ) , suggesting that h2s may have some effects and show potential therapeutic value in some cns diseases , including stroke , traumatic brain injury , alzheimer 's disease and parkinson 's disease . here 
 , we give a brief description on the mechanisms of h2s in the cns as follows ( figure 1 ) : ( 1 ) anti - oxidation : facing the oxidative stress injury after stroke occurring , h2s could promote the activation of cystine / glutamate antiporter and increase the intracellular concentrations of cys that it is a kind of substrate for the generation of glutathione . 
 in addition , in this process , -glutamyl - cysteine synthetase , a kind of rate - limiting enzyme , could also be activated by h2s and regulates the production of glutathione ( kimura and kimura , 2004 ; kimura et al . , 2010 ) , which is an important intracellular antioxidant . 
 thus , the intracellular levels of glutathione increases and could clear the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) existing in the mitochondria to achieve the goal of protecting the neurons from oxidative stress injury . 
 ( 2 ) anti - inflammatory effects : the major sites that h2s plays the role of fighting inflammatory response are astrocytes and microglia ( seifert and pennypacker , 2014 ) , where h2s could inhibit the release of no , tumor necrosis factor- and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 , and decrease the activation of p38/c - jun n - terminal kinase , conversely , increase the release of anti - inflammatory cytokines , for instance , interleukin-4/10 . 
 it is reported that sb 203580 , a kind of p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) inhibitor , could mimic the anti - inflammatory effects , indicating that h2s may regulate the immune function by mapk signaling pathway ( hu et al . , 2007 ) , but concrete mechanisms still need to be investigated . 
 ( 3 ) anti - apoptosis : a growing body of evidence points that h2s exerts its role of anti - apoptosis probably via mitochondrial apoptotic pathway , h2s could inhibit the caspase-3 signaling pathway mediated by ros and calcium pathway activated by hydrogen peroxide ( liu et al . , 
 2014 ) , accordingly , prevent the apoptosis induced by oxygen glucose deprivation / reoxygenation ( luo et al . , 2012 , 2013 ) . 
 in addition , h2s could promote the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa b ( nf-b ) , which activates the anti - apoptotic gene ( sen et al . , 2012 ) . 
 ( 4 ) facilitating long - term potentiation : it has always been demonstrated that h2s can facilitate hippocampal long - term potentiation via activating n - methyl - d - aspartic acid ( nmda ) receptor ( kimura , 2002 ) . 
 subsequently , researchers found that unlike carbon monoxide or no , h2s promotes the accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate rather than cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( kimura , 2000 ) , and nmda receptor activation induced by h2s could be inhibited by adenylate cyclase inhibitor ( kimura , 2002 ) . 
 ( 5 ) regulating calcium concentration : h2s can activate calcium channel to increase calcium influx , whereas decrease the release of calcium stored in the cells , thus induce the production of calcium waves in primary cultures of astrocytes , and this process can be inhibited by calcium channel antagonist ( nagai et al . 
 in addition , h2s has been known as an atp sensitive potassium ( katp ) channel activator in secondary brain injury after stroke or other diseases , h2s could play its neuroprotection through mimicking katp channel ( jiang et al . , 
 however , the problem of calcium overload can not be ignored ( obryant et al . , 2014 ) . 
 there are accumulating evidence that the neuroprotection or neurotoxicity of h2s depends on the concentration of it , which needs further investigations , including animals and clinical trials . 
 note : h2s : hydrogen sulfide ; cns : central nervous system ; cbs : cystathionine--synthase ; cse : cystathionine--lyase ; 3-mst : 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase ; -gcs : -glutamyl - cysteine synthetase ; ros : reactive oxygen species ; no : nitric oxide ; tnf- : tumor necrosis factor- ; il-4/10 : interleukin-4/10 ; jnk : c - jun n - terminal kinase ; nf-b : nuclear factor kappa b ; ltp : long - term potentiation . 
 nmda : n - methyl - d - aspartic acid ; katp : atp sensitive potassium . 
 as we have known , a large number of animal studies must be tested before clinical application for anything , h2s is no exception . in view of the toxicity and high solubility of h2s 
 , it is even uncommon to inhale it directly ; therefore , sodium hydrosulfide ( nahs , a h2s donor ) is widely applied in animal studies concerning cerebral injury after stroke . at present , researchers gradually reach a consensus that the neuroprotection of h2s in stroke is dose - dependent , that is , the relatively low - dose of h2s in brain may play neuroprotective effect in stroke , whereas high concentration of h2s may cause neurotoxicity , suggesting that we must view h2s from a comprehensive perspective , and enhance its advantage , while avoid its disadvantage , to apply h2s in clinical treatment more effectually . in our review , we will show our analysis for animal studies about the role h2s in stroke ( table 1 ) . 
 the neuroprotective and neurotoxic effects of hydrogen sulfide ( h2s ) in stroke the neuroprotection of h2s is exhibited as follows : ( 1 ) li et al . 
 ( 2011 ) reported that h2s , whose concentration is 0.1 mm , has neuroprotective effects by protecting hippocampal neurons , improving the deficiency of learning and memory , and increasing synaptic plasticity , decreasing the brain edema around pyramidal neurons and their nuclear shrink in a rat brain model of stroke . 
 ( 2 ) in a rat model of reversible occlusion of the right middle cerebral artery , h2s was found to reduce infarct volume through long - term hypothermia and the decrease of the expression of nf-b , thus protecting the brain against hypoxic injury due to stroke ( florian et al . , 2008 ) . 
 ( 3 ) after stroke , the endogenous concentration of h2s increases at 12 hours and decreases at 24 hours . 
 in addition , if pretreated by nahs at a relatively low dose ( 25 mmol / kg ) , the brain injury could be attenuated at 7 days after stroke ( ren et al . , 2010 ) . 
 nahs is also reported to protect brain against oxygen glucose deprivation injury ( tay et al . , 
 ( 4 ) by stimulating the phosphorylation of protein kinase b and extracellular signal regulated kinases , up - regulating vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1 expression , h2s could promote angiogenesis around the infarct area , and show better functional outcomes in a rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion ( mcao ) ( jang et al . , 2014 ) . 
 ( 5 ) h2s has anti - oxidative , anti - inflammatory , and anti - apoptotic effects in stroke ; and in cerebral ischemia / reperfusion injury , it is also reported h2s could increase the superoxide dismutase activity , anti - inflammatory interlukin-10 and anti - apoptotic protein bcl-2 , accordingly , play the role of neuroprotection ( yin et al . , 2013 ) . 
 in addition , h2s , or its donor , can reduce the infarct size and decrease the blood brain barrier damage in a model of cerebral ischemia - reperfusion injury ( gheibi et al . , 
 2014 ) . however , different models , administration paradigms and concentration of h2s may cause different results , even get the opposite conclusion : ( 1 ) using the same model of mcao , qu et al . ( 
 2006 ) found that if the h2s concentration is raised to 0.18 mm , the infarct volume will increase , instead of decrease , and this process can be ameliorated by h2s synthesis inhibitors or nmda receptor channel inhibitors , suggesting that h2s has different effects on brain in different dose - concentration . 
 ( 2 ) the concentration of h2s increases in the cortex , and reach the peak at 12 hours after cerebral ischemia , then it will decrease ( ren et al . , 2010 ) . 
 a recent research showed that h2s , at a high dose level , can cause cell death in cerebral cortex based on the model of permanent mcao , and in this process , the infarct volume can be reduced by the inhibitors of h2s synthesis enzymes , on the contrary , decreased by the administration of nahs ( qu et al . , 2006 ) . 
 ( 3 ) in addition , when the concentration of nahs is below 200 m , the apoptosis can be induced , while the concentration is higher than 200 m , nahs will induce necrosis and cause brain damage ( cheung et al . , 2007 ) . 
 in general , the neuroprotective effect of h2s in stroke is concentration - dependent , only a relatively low dose of h2s can yield beneficial effect . 
 however , there is a point we have to say , the most of research on h2s at present mainly focus on ischemic stroke , while study concerning the hemorrhagic stroke is very few , which need us to do more research to reveal the role of h2s in entire stroke . 
 at present , there is no direct clinical studies about neuroprotection of h2s being reported . 
 however , the plasma h2s level has been reported to be related to long - term clinical outcome in stroke patients . a clinical study involving 36 patients showed that high plasma cys levels on admission and before treatment tend to poor clinical outcome when assessed at 3 months after stroke , and the patients who have early stroke deterioration are usually correlated significantly with high plasma level of cys ( wong et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that h2s may be indirectly responsible for this effect . 
 furthermore , as accumulating evidence shows that hyper hcy is a risk factor for stroke ( abbate et al . , 2003 ; kim et al . , 2003 ; hassan et al . , 
 ( 2004 ) found that the concentration of hcy increased in all stroke subtypes in a case - control study including 313 participants ( 161 patients and 152 controls ) , indicating that hcy may be used as a marker for the clinical outcome of stroke as well . 
 however , the definite relationship between hyper hcy and stroke has not been found ( fallon et al . , 2001 ) , and several meta - analyses 
 have not reached an agreement ( homocysteine studies collaboration , 2002 ; fallon and ben - shlomo , 2003 ) . above all , although there is no direct evidence indicating that h2s has neuroprotective effect in clinical trials , the close touch with brain injury caused by stroke is no doubt , and needs us to make great efforts to study . 
 as what we have mentioned above , the high dose - concentration of h2s can cause systemic toxicity reacts ( nakata et al . , 2015 ; 
 wu et al . , 2015 ) , especially neurotoxic effect , because it inhibits cytochrome c oxidase and mitochondrial respiration . 
 the cns is sensitive to hypoxia , h2s poisoning can lead to respiratory paralysis rapidly and cause a series of nerve dysfunction , including brain edema , disturbance of consciousness , and others . therefore , the following strategies are extremely important , including oxygen uptake , keeping the airway open , and symptomatic and supportive treatments . 
 although h2s is known as a toxic substance , increasing evidences have indicated that h2s plays an important role of neuroprotection in stroke , while its neurotoxicity can not be neglected . 
 so , we need to view h2s in the point of dialectics , and we believe that further research on h2s , including animal studies and clinical studies , may provide a new insight into the treatment of stroke and other cns diseases , such as traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases .","stroke includes ischemic stroke hemorrhagic stroke large number clinical studies animal experiments shown cerebral injury ischemia reperfusion injury caused stroke complex physiopathologic processes involving toxic effects excitatory amino acids inflammatory reaction oxidative stress generation free radical brain edema neuronal apoptosis death zhu et al

 as society ages rapidly , stroke has become the second leading cause of disability and death , and also become the main threat to human health and life . in recent years 
 , findings from increasing animal and clinical trials have supplied scientific evidences for the treatment of stroke . 
 hydrogen sulfide ( h2s ) , which has always been seen as a toxic gas , now has been thought to be the third gaseous signaling molecule following nitric oxide and carbon monoxide . 
 accumulating evidences indicate that h2s plays an important role in stroke . given that its neuroprotective effect is dose - dependent , 
 only when its concentration is relatively low , h2s can yield the neuroprotection , while high dose may lead to neurotoxicity . 
 all these study results suggest that h2s may offer a new promising application for the therapy of stroke . here

"the amyloid- 
 ( a ) peptide is believed to play a key 
 pathogenic role in alzheimer s disease ( ad ) . in vivo , a is characterized by a distribution of isoforms , mostly 
 varying in length from 38 to 43 residues . 
 the most prominent isoform , 
 a40 , typically occurs in a 10:1 ratio to the more 
 amyloidogenic isoform , a42 . 
 knowledge of the origin 
 of the a isoform distribution , and its dependence on sequence , 
 environment , and cofactors , is critical to our understanding of the 
 etiology of ad . 
 a is the product of cleavage of app - c99 
 ( c99 ) , the 99 amino 
 acid c - terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein ( app ) , by 
 -secretase . 
 c99 consists of a single transmembrane ( tm ) helix 
 flanked by less structured extra- and intracellular domains . 
 processive 
 cleavage is initiated in the c - terminal tm helical region and proceeds 
 toward the n - terminus . 
 cleavage of c99 has been correlated with a number 
 of factors , including peptide sequence and stability of the tm helix . 
 while 
 the degree of homodimerization of c99 has also been discussed as a potentially important factor in c99 
 processing , the cleavage of c99 dimers has not yet been definitively 
 demonstrated . 
 environmental influences such as membrane composition , membrane curvature , and the presence of cholesterol may also play critical roles . it has been openly debated whether a quantitative 
 description of 
 c99 homodimerization structure is essential to a complete understanding 
 of the mechanism of cleavage of c99 by -secretase and the genesis 
 of the a isoform distribution . 
 multhaup and co - workers first 
 recognized that modifications in sequence that reduced homodimer affinity 
 impacted cleavage of c99 by -secretase . 
 subsequently , studies of homodimer formation in wt and mutant c99 
 congeners have provided support for the view that c99 homodimerization 
 is critical to c99 processing by -secretase and a formation . 
 however , it has also been argued that c99 homodimerization 
 is weak and may be largely irrelevant in vivo , suggesting 
 that -secretase acts on c99 monomer only as substrate in the 
 production of a. additionally , 
 while tycko and co - workers suggest that the structure 
 of the tm region of c99 depends on membrane composition , recent work by sanders and co - workers supports 
 the view that at least the backbone structure of c99 is largely independent 
 of membrane lipid composition . in contrast 
 , 
 smith and co - workers suggest that the a product distribution 
 following cleavage of c99 by -secretase may depend on the specific 
 structure assumed by the c99 homodimer , which may depend on sequence 
 and membrane composition . 
 although 
 there is debate over the relevance of c99 homodimer in 
 the processing of c99 to form a , there is little doubt that 
 c99 homodimer is an essential species in the overall ensemble of c99 
 structures . 
 the earliest proposed structures for the homodimer 
 of the tm region of c99 ( figure 1 ) were right - handed 
 coiled - coils stabilized by favorable interactions at the interpeptide 
 interface facilitated by the gxxxg motif . 
 this motif promotes a right - handed crossing in the -helices 
 by providing a good surface for packing and permitting close helix 
 proximity . 
 in contrast , one recent nmr 
 structure suggests that the structure of gs- c991555 ( c991555 plus two non - native amino acids at the 
 n - terminus ) consists of a left - handed coiled - coil structure stabilized 
 by interpeptide contacts facilitated by a heptad - repeat motif involving 
 g38 and a42 . 
 a more recent nmr structure of c992355 homodimer finds 
 a right - handed coiled - coil stabilized by interpeptide contacts in 
 the c - terminal region . 
 depiction of c991555 dimer in a popc 
 lipid bilayer 
 ( left ) and in a dpc micelle ( right ) . 
 the phosphocholine group is shaded 
 orange ( popc ) or yellow ( dpc ) . 
 these contrasting results suggest that a number of fundamental 
 questions related to the structure and processing of c99 in the production 
 of a , including the structure of c99 monomer and homodimer , 
 the sensitivity of monomer and homodimer structure to sequence and 
 membrane , and the relevance of homodimer formation to c99 processing , 
 remain open and require further scrutiny . here 
 we address a number 
 of critical questions regarding the nature of the c99 homodimer strucure 
 and its dependence on membrane or micelle characteristics . what 
 is the structural ensemble of the c99 homodimer in a micelle 
 environment ? 
 how well do structures of c99 homodimer in a micelle 
 represent the structural ensemble in a lipid bilayer ? to answer 
 these questions , we carried out multiscale simulations 
 of c991555 dimer in popc bilayers and dpc micelles 
 building on our previous successful predictions of the monomer structures . 
 we used coarse - grained ( cg ) simulations with 
 the martini force field of a broad sampling of the peptide 
 dimer and lipid / surfactant ensemble . 
 our model is benchmarked against the well - studied glycophorin a 
 ( gpa ) dimer and used to develop novel predictions for the c991555 dimer . following the identification of the 
 predominant structural states 
 through cg simulations , representative conformations in all - atom 
 molecular 
 dynamics simulations were used to refine the atomistic structure and 
 characterize the detailed peptide  peptide , peptide 
 the major finding of 
 our work is that the structural ensemble in a bilayer is heterogeneous , 
 consisting of multiple states , whereas in a micelle only one state 
 is predominantly selected . globally 
 the curvature of the bilayer and 
 micelle is different , which has a profound influence on the conformational 
 heterogeneity . 
 more generally , our study demonstrates that the chemical 
 environment imposes a selection on the nature of the app dimer ensemble . 
 the environmental selection of the structure is yet another variable , 
 besides sequence , which can affect the plasticity of app , and hence 
 the product distribution upon cleavage by secretases . 
 initial conditions 
 for the cg 
 parametrization were taken from the experimentally derived structures 
 determined by nmr in dodecylphosphocholine ( dpc ) micellar environment 
 ( pdb 2loh ) using the martinize.py script and the martini 
 2.2 force field for proteins . to build 
 the popc cg systems , two spatially 
 separated c991555 monomers were overlapped with the pre - equilibrated lipid systems 
 taken from the marrink web site ( http://md.chem.rug.nl/cgmartini/ ) . 
 all lipid and water residues within 1.5  of the cg peptide 
 were removed . for the dpc cg systems the same dimeric 2loh structure 
 was used . 
 a dimer was embeded in a pre - equilibrated dpc cg micelle 
 box also taken from the marrink web site . 
 the cg bilayer system consisted 
 of a c991555 dimer , 256 popc lipids , 3863 water 
 particles , and 6 cl ions to neutralize the system . 
 the cg micelle system contained c991555 dimers , 
 54 dpc lipids , 5597 water particles , and 6 cl ions . 
 additional cg simulations were performed using 70 and 108 dpc surfactant 
 molecules ( see supporting information ) . for the cg simulations a total of 50 replicas with 
 1.5 s 
 of md were performed on each system in order to see convergence in 
 the computed distribution of homodimer structures ( see figures s1 and s2 ) . 
 nonbonded interactions were 
 truncated using shift functions ( between 0.9 and 1.2 nm for lennard - jones 
 interactions and between 0 and 1.2 nm for electrostatics ) . the temperature of the systems was set to 303 
 k using the berendsen weak coupling method with a coupling time of 0.1 ps . 
 the pressure was set to 1 bar using a 
 semi - isotropic coupling for popc and isotropic coupling for dpc using 
 the berendsen algorithm . a cg 
 structure from each 
 of the different states in the popc bilayer and dpc micelle ( gly - in , 
 gly - side , and gly - out ) was randomly selected and reconstructed into 
 an all - atom representation using pulchra . 
 the structure with its orientation were resolvated in popc lipids 
 or dpc surfactant using the charmm - gui membrane and micelle builder and modeled using the charmm36 all - atom lipid and protein force 
 field and tip3p water model . 
 the bilayer systems consisted of the c991555 dimers 
 reconstructed from cg models , 128 popc lipids , tip3p water molecules 
 extending 15  on each side of the bilayer , and 6 cl ions to neutralize the systems . 
 the micelle systems contained c991555 monomer , 53 dpc molecules , tip3p waters to solvate 
 a box extending 20  from the dpc surfactant and protein , and 
 6 cl ions to neutralize the system . for simulations 
 in the popc bilayer a total of 100 ns of md 
 were performed on each 
 system ( following minimization and a short nvt and npt equilibration 
 with protein backbone fixed ) . 
 the pressure was set to 1 bar using 
 a semi - isotropic coupling scheme with lateral and perpendicular pressures 
 treated separately with coupling time 0.1 ps using the parrinello 
 the temperature of the system was set to 303 
 k and regulated using the nos 
 the nonbonded interactions 
 were truncated using shift functions 
 ( between 0.9 and 1.2 nm for lennard - jones interactions and between 
 0 and 1.2 nm for electrostatics ) . 
 long - range electrostatic interactions 
 were calculated using the particle mesh ewald ( pme ) method with a fourier grid spacing of 0.12 nm . 
 the 
 linear constraint solver ( lincs ) method was used to constrain all bond lengths , with a 2 fs integration 
 step . 
 all - atom simulations in a dpc micelle were carried out under 
 the same conditions using an isotropic coupling scheme to control 
 the pressure . 
 the simulations were carried out using gromacs 
 ( v4.5.1 ) and the 
 analyses were performed using the gromacs package , the dssp program , 
 and tailored scripts using python and md analysis libraries . 
 the helanal program was used to calculate the kink angle along the 
 tm helix between residues k28 and v50 . 
 c991555 homodimer was simulated using cg molecular 
 dynamics in a popc bilayer and dpc micelle ( see figure 2 ) . 
 multiple independent dynamical trajectories were initiated 
 from the experimentally determined left - handed coiled - coil structure 
 in a dpc micelle . 
 all simulated replicas 
 were observed to undergo conversion to a distribution that strongly 
 favors right - handed helical packing ( see figure 2 ) . 
 simulated distributions for a cg model of the c991555 homodimer in popc membrane ( left panel ) and dpc micelle ( right panel ) 
 projected onto the order parameters 4 g and dgg . 4 g is the dihedral angle 
 formed by g29a - g37a - g37b - g29b , where a and b label the two c991555 monomers , 
 and dgg is the interhelical distance between 
 g33a - g33b . 
 the system sequence is shown below the panels 
 where g29 , g33 , and g37 are highlighted 
 and the tm helical domain is shaded . 
 the black triangles depict the 
 values of 4 g and dgg obtained from the experimentally derived nmr structure of c992355 . 
 the structure of the homodimer is conveniently 
 characterized in 
 terms of an interhelical distance , dgg and a dihedral angle , 4 g that differentiates the 
 handedness of the coiled - coil . 
 the 4 g order parameter 
 is positive for left - handed structures and negative for right - handed 
 structures . 
 structures stabilized by interpeptide interactions facilitated 
 by the gxxxg repeat region are characterized by small values of the dgg parameter . 
 the first experimentally 
 derived solution phase nmr structure of 
 the c991555 homodimer in a micelle is characterized 
 by a left - handed coiled - coil geometry with 4 g = 
 + 31 and dgg = 20  , forming 
 an x - like homodimer configuration with minimal interpeptide 
 contact in the g38xxxa42 region . 
 in contrast , 
 a more recent experimentally derived nmr structure of the shorter 
 c992355 homodimer in a a micelle is characterized 
 by a right - handed coiled - coil geometry with 4 g  
 25 and dgg  14  . the simulated homodimer distribution in 
 popc bilayer and dpc micelle 
 environments are dominated by right - handed coiled - coil conformations . 
 however , the broad distribution of homodimer conformations as a function 
 of dgg ( see figure 2 ) reflects the existence of distinct conformational states , implying 
 considerable heterogeneity in the structural ensemble . 
 structural ensembles of two c991555 monomers 
 in a popc bilayer , derived from 50 independent cg replica simulations 
 ( see above ) , are presented in figures 2 and 4 . 
 interestingly , the c991555 homodimer 
 assembled spontaneously on the time scale of a few hundred nanoseconds . 
 this suggests that the sampling achieved with the cg model effectively 
 represents the equilibrium homodimer structural ensemble in this single - component 
 popc lipid bilayer . 
 although there are three characteristic 
 states in the popc bilayer , a significant shift in population between 
 substates is observed in the dpc micelle environment . in particular , 
 while the homodimer in a popc bilayer is predominantly found in the 
 gly - in substate , in the dpc micelle the homodimer is dominanted by 
 gly - side and gly - out conformations . 
 analysis of the dimer ensemble ( see figures 2 and 4 ) clearly shows the existence of multiple 
 conformational state populations . 
 crick identifies 
 the location of a residue relative to the axis between the two helices 
 ( figure 3 ) . 
 smaller values ( between 0 and 60 ) 
 identify residues closer to the dimer interface , while larger angles 
 ( close to 180 ) denote residues on opposite sides of the interface . 
 for the competing structural states , 
 we find ( 1 ) gly - in configurations 
 with close interpeptide contacts facilitated by exposure of backbone 
 carbonyls in the gxxxg repeat region ( small dgg , small crick ) , ( 2 ) gly - out configurations 
 characterized by glycine repeats facing the outside of the homodimer 
 interface ( large dgg , large crick ) , and ( 3 ) gly - side configurations characterized by  out - of - phase  
 values of crick ( intermediate dgg , small / large or large / small crick ) . 
 similar observations have been made in past computational studies 
 of c99 homodimerization employing simplified models . 
 our results are consistent with those general observations , 
 while providing a more detailed analysis of the homodimer ensemble 
 and its dependence on environment 
 . definition of crick corresponding to the angle 
 between ( 1 ) the vector connecting the axis points of the two helices 
 and ( 2 ) the vector connecting the c of a given residue 
 to its corresponding -helical axis point . 
 we define crick to be the average of the g33 and g37 dimer crick angles 
 in order to characterize the g33xxxg37 interface . 
 most representative structure is a gly - in state 
 for the popc bilayer 
 ( top left ) and gly - out state for the dpc micelle ( top right ) . 
 simulated 
 distributions for a cg model of the c991555 homodimer 
 in popc membrane ( bottom left ) and dpc micelle ( bottom right ) projected 
 onto the crick angles characterize the relative orientation of peptides 
 within a homodimer . 
 the black triangles depict the values of crick obtained from the experimentally derived nmr structure of c992355 . 
 the atomic coordinates 
 of the most representative structures ( gly - in , gly - side and gly - out ) 
 have been deposited as supporting information . 
 figure 5 shows the distance between residues ak28 and bk28 ( kk28 ) or ak54 and bk54 ( kk53 ) where a and b indicate different monomers . 
 the 
 two distances represent the separation between the interfacial residues 
 of the tm helices , and is a good measure to characterize the global 
 topology of the dimer structure . 
 parallel or ll - like 
 structures are characterized by both smaller kk28 and kk54 distances ( 5  ) , -like structures show smaller 
 kk28 distances and larger kk54 distances , x - like structures show large kk28 and kk54 distances ( 15  ) , and y - like structures 
 have small kk54 and large kk28 distances . 
 simulations 
 in popc adopt predominantly ll - or -like conformations 
 consistent with our previous computational predictions of c992355 homodimer in a membrane environment . 
 we predicted a -like right - handed helical 
 dimer structure in agreement with solid state nmr studies with a predominantly gly - in orientation between 
 the helices . 
 in contrast , the dpc micelle simulations show larger 
 populations of y- or x - like structures 
 with a predominantly gly - out orientation between the helices ( figure 4 ) .

 4 g : red , green , and blue correspond to gly - in , gly - side , 
 and gly - out conformations for data of cg simulations . 
 the spot size 
 corresponds to the number of structures for that particular kk28 and kk54 conformation . 
 the black triangles are 
 the values of kk28 and kk54 obtained from the 
 experimentally derived nmr structure of 
 c992355 . on the lower section the most representative 
 -like ( far left ) and ll - like ( center left ) 
 conformations for the simulations in popc bilayer 
 x - like ( center right ) and y - like ( far right ) 
 conformations for the dpc micelle environment are shown in red . the 
 k28 and k55 residues are indicated with orange 
 spheres . results of additional cg simulations 
 performed using 70 and 108 
 dpc surfactant molecules are shown in figure 6 . 
 qualitatively , we see that the x - like strucures 
 are dominant for all micelle sizes . as the number of surfactant molecules 
 is increased , there is a broadening of the distribution of x - like states . 
 these results suggest that the micelle environment 
 suppresses the sampling of gly - in conformations and favors x- and y - like structures , largely independent 
 of the size of the micelle .

 the right 
 panel corresponds to kk28 and kk54 for the c991555 system in 108 dpc surfactant molecules . 
 the spot 
 size corresponds to the number of structures for that particular kk28 and kk54 conformation . 
 we performed 
 all - atom simulations using charmm36 in popc bilayer and dpc micelle 
 environments , starting from representative cg structures from the 
 gly - in , gly - side and gly - out homodimer conformational states . 
 experimental data suggest that the average stability of the tm helix 
 is similar for monomeric peptide and peptide associated as a homodimer . 
 average helicity of each peptide in the micelle 
 and bilayer is shown in figure 7 . 
 we also show 
 results for the simulated helicity of c991555 monomer 
 in dpc micelle and popc lipid for comparison , along with experimentally 
 derived helicity values for monomeric c99 in a micelle . 
 the average helicity in the tm domain of the 
 simulated peptide is in good agreement with the experimentally measured 
 helicity , while helicity in the juxtamembrane ( jm ) domain is somewhat larger in the simulated structures . 
 this could result from differing size of the hydrophobic core in the 
 micelle versus the bilayer , as the higher water accessibility in the 
 micelle is expected to impact the stability of the helix structure , 
 as well as the differing head groups and interfacial environments 
 of the dpc ( zwitterionic , simulation ) and lmpg ( anionic , experiment ) 
 micelles .

 and gly - out ) calculated from all - atom simulations of c991555 homodimer in a popc bilayer ( above ) and dpc micelle ( below ) . 
 thin 
 black lines show results for helicity of c991555 monomer in the corresponding micelle or bilayer . 
 the gray shadow 
 shows experimentally determined helicity based on c nmr chemical shift measurements for monomeric c99155 in an lmpg ( lysomyristoylphosphatidylglycerol ) micelle . 
 structural fluctuations in the kink angle are enhanced and 
 less 
 symmetric in the c991555 homodimer in a dpc micelle 
 relative to the homodimer in a popc bilayer , while fluctuations in 
 homodimeric c991555 are smaller in magnitude than 
 those observed for the c991555 monomer ( see figure 8) . 
 in particular , in the vgsn region we found more 
 substantial fluctuations in the helicity that can be related to the 
 surface curvature of the micelle environment . 
 our results 
 indicate that a structural kink appears near g37/g38 in the c991555 monomer in a popc bilayer and dpc micelle , as 
 has been proposed for the monomer structure based on experimental 
 results for c99155 in a lpmg micelle . 
 a structural kink is also observed near g37/g38 
 in the c991555 homodimer in the dpc micelle environment . 
 however , simulations of c991555 in dpc micelles 
 show additional structural kinks in the tm helix . 
 greater kink angles 
 are induced in an attempt to match the hydrophobic length of the tm 
 helix with the hydrophobic thickness of the small dpc micelle . 
 gly - in 
 conformations that destabilize the tm - c domain show a large kink at 
 t43 , while gly - out structures that destabilize the tm - n helix show 
 a large kink at g33 .

 the c991555 homodimer ( figure 9 ) . superimposed on the density profiles are distributions 
 of key peptide residues . 
 importantly , although the density profiles 
 of the lipophilic phase of the bilayer and surfactant micelle are 
 similar , the solvent distributions in the two environments are dramatically 
 different . 
 in addition , the relative positions of 
 key residues , including the -cleavage site , are significantly 
 shifted relative to the center of the lipophilic phase in the dpc 
 micelle when compared to the popc bilayer .

 the number of waters molecules ( nw ) within 
 4  of each amino acid of the dimers are indicated by blue bars . 
 the epr power saturation data derived from experimental measurements is shown for comparison ( black dashed line ) . a recent study involving h / d exchange 
 experiments on the c99 peptide , 
 complemented by molecular dynamics simulations of c992855 in a popc bilayer , provided insight into the stability of helical 
 regions of c99 including the tm helix . considering the hinge at g37/38 to be a flexible divider in the 
 tm helix , the n - terminal region of the tm domain ( tm - n helix ) showed 
 enhanced h / d exchange relative to the c - terminal portion ( tm - c helix ) . 
 our simulation results for the c991555 homodimer in a dpc micelle , in which a dominant  hinge  
 and less stable tm - n domain are observed , are consistent with those 
 experimental and computational results . 
 studies have indicated 
 that membrane protein structure in micelles 
 and membranes can be similar for certain systems . the gpa homodimer has been extensively studied in micelle 
 and bilayer environments , through both experimental and computational 
 approaches , making it an excellent reference system for understanding 
 environmental effects on the c991555 homodimer . 
 homodimerization of gpa in a micelle has been explored using all - atom 
 molecular dynamics simulation , yielding 
 good agreement with known experimental structures . 
 moreover , simulations 
 employing an all - atom model of the gpa homodimer in dpc surfactant 
 micelle and dmpc / dhpc lipid bicelles found 
 the general topology of the homodimer to be similar in both environments . 
 in contrast , other studies have noted a dependence of protein structure 
 and association on the differing structural environments of micelles 
 and bilayers , as well as the particular detergent composition of micelles 
 or lipid composition of membrane bilayers . there is substantial evidence 
 that for a particular membrane system , a careful choice of detergent 
 must be made to create a micellular environment in which the protein 
 conformational ensemble is similar to that in a membrane bilayer . 
 it has been observed that dimerization of gpa 
 can be modulated by detergents , with variations in 
 alkyl chain length and headgroup nature ( ionic , zwitterionic , and 
 nonionic ) potentially influencing helix stability and helix dimerization . 
 as a result , variations in detergent may impact helix dimerization 
 while having little impact on helix stability . finally , it is known 
 that tm helical structure and stability can show a strong dependence 
 on lipid composition in membrane bilayers . as in the case of c99 , dimerization of the gpa tm domain 
 has 
 been 
 proposed to be a consequence of favorable intermolecular interactions 
 facilitated by gxxxg motif repeats . 
 we have simulated the sequence 
 of gpa62101 using the same multiscale simulation 
 approach employed in our study of c99 . 
 the gpa62101 sequence includes a tm helical domain and n - terminal juxtamembrane 
 domain , as is the case in c991555 . 
 good order parameters 
 for the homodimer structures in gpa ( c99 ) are ( 1 ) dihedral angle gt formed by g18a - t26a - t26b - g18b , where a and b label the two gpa62101 monomers , ( 2 ) interhelical distance dgg between g22a and g22b , and ( 3 ) the crick angle 
 crick of the gxxxg motif . 
 the gt order parameter is positive for left - handed structures and negative 
 for right - handed structures . 
 structures stabilized by interpeptide 
 interactions facilitated by the gxxxg repeat region are characterized 
 by small values of the dgg parameter and 
 small values of gt . 
 experimentally derived nmr structures 
 are found to agree well with the simulation predictions in terms of 
 ( gt , dgg ) . 
 differences 
 of 15 are observed in the comparison of crick angles between experimentally derived and computationally predicted 
 structures . 
 the observed differences may result from inherent limitations 
 in the spatial resolution of both the coarse - grained model employed 
 in our study and experimental data . left : simulated distributions for a cg 
 model of the gpa62101 homodimer in a popc bilayer

 on the right corresponds to gt and dgg ( top ) and crick angles ( crick ) ( bottom )

 nmr structures derived from gpa62101 in dpc micelles 
 ( 1afo , black ) , gpa7098 in dpc micelles ( 2kpe , green ) , 
 and gpa6198 in dmpc / dhpc bicelles ( 2kpf , red ) . 
 our simulations results suggest 
 similarities between between the 
 dpc micelle and popc bilayer simulations of gpa62101 and c991555 homodimers , as well as sequence specific 
 effects differentiating the two dimer ensembles . 
 ( 1 ) the strucural 
 distribution of c991555 dimer is signficantly more 
 diverse than in the case of the gpa62101 homodimer . 
 ( 2 ) in both gpa and c99 homodimers , the structural ensembles are found 
 to be significantly more diverse in the bilayer environment , relative 
 to the micelle , consisting of multiple distinct conformational substates . 
 in the dpc micelle 
 , only one of the substates tends to be represented 
 as it is selectively stabilized by the micelle geometry and surface 
 curvature . 
 it is useful to note that while gpa explores gly - side and 
 gly - out homodimer conformations in a bilayer environment , the distribution 
 is substantially more focused and dominated by right - handed gly - in 
 structures than in the case of c991555 homodimer . 
 the results of this study , showing a clear dependence of c991555 homodimer structure on micelle and bilayer environment , are consistent 
 with this understanding . 
 the earliest predicted structures for the c992355 fragment , containing the tm helical domain , proposed a right - handed 
 coiled - coil structure consistent with the gly - in topology described 
 in this work . 
 a recent nmr structure 
 of the c992355 homodimer in a dpc micelle environment 
 is also a right - handed coiled - coil , although of the gly - out topology . 
 an earlier nmr structure for the c991555 homodimer in a dpc micelle environment led to the proposal of a 
 left - handed coiled - coil of the gly - out topology . 
 however , it was noted the homodimer ensemble may well contain 
 right - handed and left - handed coiled - coil structures . 
 it is expected 
 that both the length and sequence of the c99 fragment are critical 
 to the ultimate homodimer structure . while dimers formed from the 
 wt tm domain alone are almost certainly right - handed coiled - coils 
 in most environments , it is possible that introducing mutations within 
 the tm domain or the addition of the jm domain could lead to a shift 
 in the relative population of one of the various dimer states ( gly - in , 
 gly - side , or gly - out ) or a change in the handedness of the homodimer . 
 it has been observed that small changes in sequence can strongly impact 
 binding affinities for tm homodimers . 
 our study has focused on the 
 c991555 , while the work of the arseniev laboratory is based on gs - c991555 , in 
 which two non - native amino acids ( gs ) have been added to the n - terminus . 
 it is possible that the addition of these residues , not included in 
 our computational study , could impact the structure of the jm domain 
 and also the handedness of the resulting homdimer relative to c991555 . in this context , it is important to note that 
 our study focuses on c991555 rather than full - length 
 c99 . 
 therefore , our results must be considered to provide insight 
 into , but not fully represent , the properties of the full - length peptide . 
 additional analysis shows good agreement between chemical shifts 
 computed from our simulated homodimer structures and experimentally 
 derived chemical shifts ( see figures s3 and s4 ) . 
 however , the experimentally 
 derived noe data provide unambiguous support for a left - handed coiled - coil 
 structure of gs- c991555 homodimer in dpc micelle . 
 this suggests that the chemical shifts are largely 
 determined by the secondary structure of the peptide and local environment 
 and are weak reporters on the nature of the tertiary coiled - coil geometry . 
 the findings of this paper provide a complete and self - consistent 
 framework for organizing the existing experimental and computational 
 results . for structures of the tm domain represented by the c992355 peptide 
 , computational and experimental results 
 suggest that in most membrane and micelle environments the structure 
 is a right - handed coiled coil . 
 the particular homodimer topology will 
 depend on the membrane thickness or micelle size and curvature , with 
 thinner environments ( dmpc bilayer ) and those with substantial surface 
 curvature ( dpc micelle ) selecting gly - out topologies , with thicker 
 environments ( popc bilayer ) selecting gly - in structures . 
 evidence 
 from this study as well as the available nmr structures 
 suggest that the handedness of the coiled - coil structure adopted by 
 c991555 is ultimately primarily determined by ( 1 ) 
 a preference of the tm domain of the wt protein to form a right - handed 
 coilded coil , ( 2 ) characteristics of the membrane or micelle thickness 
 and surface curvature , and ( 3 ) the secondary structure and relative 
 position of the jm domain . in our study of the wt c991555 in popc bilyaer and dpc micelle 
 , we have largely assumed that the 
 jm domain is helical , leading to a preference for a right - handed coiled - coil 
 structure . 
 however , fluctuations in the structure of the jm domain 
 and its orientation relative to the tm domain may lead to a relative 
 stabilization of left - handed coiled - coil strutures . 
 overall , 
 the homodimer ensemble must be considered to consist of 
 left- and right - handed coiled coils , representing gly - in , gly - side , 
 and gly - out topologies . 
 the handedness and topology of the dominant 
 homodimer structure will be determined by the protein sequence and 
 the bilayer or micelle . 
 we find the c991555 homodimer structural ensemble 
 in popc micelles and dpc bilayers consists of multiple conformational 
 states that are structurally distinct and largely characterized by 
 the relative orientation of the peptide helices . a dynamic  hinge  
 near g37/g38 is observed to divide the tm helix , with structural fluctuations 
 being greater in the micelle than in the popc bilayer environment . 
 dimerization results in little change in helix stability in the popc 
 bilayer , but a measurable decrease in helix stability is observed 
 in the dpc micelle . although the dimer ensemble in either environment 
 is characterized by multiple conformational states , the dominant structures 
 observed in our simulations in both the dpc micelle and popc bilayer 
 are consistently right - handed coiled - coil structures , supporting the 
 conclusions of earlier experimental and 
 computational studies . 
 the relative importance 
 of particular states is modulated by the 
 c991555 homodimer environment . 
 the gly - in substate 
 ( stabilized by interpeptide contacts facilitated by the gxxxg motif 
 repeats ) is predominant in a popc bilayer environment , while the gly - out 
 conformation ( stabilized by interpeptide contacts consistent with 
 a heptad repeat motif including g38 and a42 ) is dominant in a dpc 
 surfactant micelle environment . 
 our results suggest the dpc micelle 
 environment suppresses interactions mediated by gxxxg repeats in the 
 tm region , leading to an x - shaped structure that best satisfies the 
 boundaries of the surfactant / solvent interface . in this way , 
 the environment 
  selects  a predominant substate through membrane thickness , 
 interfacial curvature , and peptide - lipid interactions . 
 past 
 computational studies of homodimers of the tm domain of c99 
 have noted similar heterogeneity in the homodimer ensemble . 
 moreover , it has been proposed that the tm domain 
 of c99 may be  processed to the  sites depending on 
 its dimerzation state and on the orientation of the tm helices in 
 the dimers  . 
 our findings support 
 these prior studies suggesting a role for membrane in modulating the 
 formation of specific c99 homodimer structures for processing by secretases , 
 as well as our interpretation of structures derived in diverse micelle 
 environments .","depiction c dimer popc lipid bilayer left dpc micelle right

 99 amino acid c - terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein 
 ( c99 ) , consisting of a single transmembrane ( tm ) helix , is known to 
 form homodimers . 
 homodimers can be processed by -secretase 
 to produce amyloid- ( a ) protein , which is implicated 
 in alzheimer s disease ( ad ) . while knowledge of the structure 
 of c99 homodimers is of great importance , 
 experimental nmr studies 
 and simulations have produced varying structural models , including 
 right - handed and left - handed coiled - coils . in order to investigate 
 the structure of this critical protein complex , simulations of the 
 c991555 homodimer in popc membrane bilayer and

 homodimer supports a variety of slowly interconverting structural 
 states .

"the advent of titanium implants resulted in a treatment modality with a high level of 
 applicability in several clinical situations . 
 although the original protocol was initially designed for the 
 treatment of completely edentulous patients , the need arose to extrapolate treatment 
 alternatives with osseointegrated implants to partially dentate patients . 
 implant 
 dentistry added a new alternative in oral rehabilitation , but at no time , have 
 osseointegrated implants been capable of resembling natural teeth with regard to their 
 characteristics . 
 this combination was applied to 
 partially edentulous patients , contradicting branemark 's protocol , which was based on 
 isolating implants from natural teeth . 
 however , the distribution of the teeth in the 
 arch may induce the adoption of combined prostheses . for decades , 
 tooth - implant - supported dentures have been questioned because of the 
 differences of mobility between the abutments , the risk of intrusion of the natural 
 abutment , as well as the atrophy of the periodontal ligament , and the high 
 general risk of technical complications . 
 the great difference between an osseointegrated implant 
 and a natural tooth is the form of the structural union with the bone and the different 
 mechanism of absorption and dissipation of force , which makes the tooth - implant bond a 
 biomechanical dilemma . 
 the possibility of connecting implants to teeth in fixed denture , with a favorable 
 prognosis has been studied by several authors who concluded that the tooth - implant bond does not have a 
 negative influence on the marginal bone and soft tissues . 
 therefore , it was not possible 
 to show any greater risk of deficiency for fixed tooth - implant - supported dentures 
 ( ftisd ) when compared with implant - supported dentures , which were well accepted , 
 particularly by patients in unfavorable financial situations , who were unable to have 
 the ideal number of implants placed . nevertheless , the connection of natural teeth and osseointegrated implants in a rigid 
 denture caused concern and publications , with studies and guidelines for both extremes . 
 there is a significant difference in the absorption and distribution of force between 
 natural teeth and implants . 
 this occurs because in tooth - supported dentures there is a 
 system of cushioning causing a micro - movement of 100 to 300 m due to the 
 presence of the periodontal ligament , as load will be transmitted to the bone with 
 beneficial stimulation by transforming the stresses of pressure into uniform traction on 
 the alveolar cortical . in implants 
 , the resultant stress is concentrated on the bone 
 crest , and this different dissipation of force may cause a lever arm , which depends on 
 the length of the pontic producing torque on the implant , causing loosening or fracture 
 of the retention screw . in view of such a situation , 
 the use of semi - rigid connections has been recommended , 
 taking into consideration that this type of connection could be more efficient in terms 
 of compensating for the difference in mobility between the abutments . 
 nevertheless , other authors have reported that the semi - rigid 
 connections are rarely indicated in unilateral fixed dentures . 
 this type of 
 connection does not improve the stress distribution between the abutments , and are the 
 cause of migration of the natural teeth . 
 ideal tooth - implant supported fixed dentures ( tisfds ) are those in which the space is 
 small , including one tooth and one implant with the possibility of a maximum of two 
 pontics . 
 nevertheless , other 
 authors have reported that the ideal tisfds are those with a larger number of natural 
 abutments to promote greater rigidity of this denture . 
 the aim of this study was to use finite element method ( fem ) to evaluate the generation 
 of stresses in a fixed tooth - implant - supported denture with a rigid connection , when 
 varying the number of teeth used as abutments . 
 over the last few years , fem applied to biomechanics has become an extremely useful tool 
 for numerically assessing stresses and deformations associated with the mechanical 
 behavior of biomaterials and human tissues . in this study , the 3-d model of the fem 
 is an approximate 
 representation of an in vivo geometry , with the physical 
 characteristics of a real model . in this study , 
 the ansys revision 5.7 program was used 
 to develop a model of a partially edentulous maxilla , conceived by means of 3-d fem , in 
 which an implant - tooth supported fixed denture was constructed . 
 representative volumes 
 of the implants , abutments , prosthetic crowns and cortical and spongy bone were created . 
 connection of this denture was simulated by means of a metal surface of a non - noble nicr 
 alloy , varying the number of teeth connected to an osseointegrated iti 
 strauman implant , 10.00 mm long , 4.1 mm in diameter , with a 4.8 mm 
 platform . to compose this denture , 
 metal - ceramic crowns were constructed in the shape of 
 premolars , which were connected by means of a pontic , using rigid connection , in order 
 to be analyzed in two configurations : the first configuration contemplated one tooth and 
 one implant ( model 1 ) , and the second configuration contemplated two teeth and one 
 implant ( model 2 ) . from the basic geometry created , the elastic properties of the various materials were 
 attributed , using approximate values found in the literature ( table 1 ) . 
 the elastic properties of the materials were adopted in a 
 linear system , whose hypothesis is that the deformation of elastic bodies is 
 proportional to the force applied . 
 furthermore , these properties were considered 
 constant and isotropic ( equal in all directions ) . 
 elastic properties of several materials that compose the model from the creation of the basic geometry , the finite element mesh composed of 297.096 
 knots and 213.129 elements for the model with one tooth and one implant ( model 1 ) and 
 529.930 knots and 383.670 elements for the model with two teeth and one implant ( model 
 2 ) were generated , according to figures 1 and 
 2 . 
 finite element mesh model 1 finite element mesh model 2 the study of biomechanics is , however , an analysis of the distribution of forces to the 
 bone when teeth are occluding . 
 it has been observed in tests that the intensity of the 
 bilateral and unilateral physiological force is 569 n and 430 n respectively and clinical observations have shown 
 that lateral forces are not well tolerated by the dental and bone structures , as occurs 
 with axial forces . in this model , a 
 vertical load of 100 n was applied on the occlusal face of the entire prosthetic set , 
 distributed uniformly according to the number of elements of the respective surfaces 
 ( figures 3 and 4 ) . 
 nodal load of 100 n on the denture containing 3 elements nodal load of 100 n on the denture containing 4 elements 
 this model was designed and submitted to a vertical load , in which its effect was 
 assessed quantitatively in n / mm ( mpa ) and qualitatively . 
 the images 
 generated by the program used in the present study made it possible to gain a broad and 
 significant understanding of the distribution of these stresses in the bone tissue , as 
 well as in the prosthetic components and associated structures . 
 the quantitative results are summarized in table 
 2 with plotting of the von mises stress ( seqv ) for the tooth - implant - supported 
 dentures with one and two teeth . 
 the table also shows the results of maximum 
 displacement ( dmx ) of the set . 
 quantitative analysis seqv = von mises stress ; dmx = maximum displacement in a qualitative analysis , it may be observed that the vertical displacement of 
 tooth - implant - supported dentures with one tooth and one implant , the tooth showed 
 greater movement in the apical direction ( figure 
 5 ) . 
 however , when a tooth was added in the mesial region of this denture , a 
 reduction in its vertical movement was observed ( figure 
 6 ) . movement of the set in the occlusal - gingival direction ( model 1 ) movement of the set in the occlusal - gingival direction ( model 2 ) in the analysis of the seqv stresses , it was observed that the maximum stress in the 
 tisfds containing one tooth ( model 1 ) was 47.84 mpa , whereas for the denture containing 
 two teeth ( model 2 ) the maximum stress was 35.82 mpa , both located in the region between 
 the tooth and the pontic , as shown in figures 7 
 and 8 . in selecting the images , 
 when the 
 structures that compose the prosthetic crowns are removed , we can verify that the 
 maximum seqv stress occurred on the mesial side of the implant neck region , at the 
 junction with the cortical bone , with values of 12.15 and 8.85 mpa for models 1 and 2 
 respectively , as illustrated in figures 9 and 
 10 . 
 it can be verified that in the denture 
 containing two teeth , the load is practically absorbed by the implant with a slight 
 increase in tension on the tooth closest to the pontic , however , these loads can be 
 considered insignificant . 
 von mises stress ( seqv ) in model 1 von mises stress ( seqv ) in model 2 von mises stress ( seqv ) in the implant region in model 1 von mises stress ( seqv ) in the implant and teeth in model 2 in the analysis of equivalent stresses of von mises ( seqv ) generated in metal , we note 
 that the maximum stress is found in the same region between the natural abutment and 
 pontic for both the models , with values of 50.0 mpa for model 1 and 34.14 mpa for model 
 2 ( figures 11 and 12 ) . 
 this location of the maximum value in metal indicates that there is 
 greater flexion of the metal bar in the region between the tooth and pontic . 
 von mises stress ( seqv ) in the metallic infrastructure ( model 1 ) von mises stress ( seqv ) in the metallic infrastructure ( model 1 ) in the electromyography study to assess the intensity of the bilateral and unilateral 
 physiological force , the result found for bilateral force was 569 n and 430 n when 
 measured unilaterally . 
 thus , according to table 3 , one may make a comparison for functional loads from the flow limit 
 of the materials . 
 this table allows one to observe that the porcelain with specific 
 properties used in this study , when submitted to load in model 1 , showed admissible 
 values for occlusal loads ( kx100n ) lower than the one found for maximum physiological 
 load . 
 maximum von mises stress ( seqv ) values compared with the se flow stresses and 
 admissible occlusal loads for the materials 
 starting from a real principle proposed in the literature , the connection between teeth 
 and implants must not be considered as the first alternative for rehabilitation and it 
 is preferable to adopt planning of isolated implant - supported dentures . 
 nevertheless , in case 
 of anatomic limitations that may require advanced surgical techniques at high costs or 
 if teeth already require restorative interventions and are favorably distributed in the 
 arch , a combination between teeth and implants may be adopted with success rates similar 
 to those of fixed implant - supported dentures . 
 there is a vast amount of literature with regard to the biomechanical challenge of the 
 connection between teeth and implants . 
 authors have reported that this complication is 
 due to the difference in mobility between them , different mechanisms of absorption and 
 dissipation of forces and mechanical - receptor properties . however , 
 biomechanical 
 responses in the face of a force are completely different , and in 
 tooth - implant - supported dentures , special care must be taken in planning to compensate 
 this difference . 
 nevertheless , according to the literature it is conclusive that 
 in fixed tooth - implant - supported dentures , connections of the semi - rigid type generate 
 more stress in the denture components so that the rigid 
 connection has been preferred instead of the semi - rigid type . from analysis of the results , 
 the present study allows one to observe that there was a 
 reduction in the displacement of the prosthetic set , as well as a lower stress , when a 
 natural abutment was added , confirming previous findings that if the placement of only 
 one implant were possible , then two natural abutments must be used as retainers to 
 support a pontic thereby improving the rigidity of the set . 
 this 
 difference in stresses can also be explained by the fact that although the loading value 
 had been equal , the loads were better distributed in model 2 . 
 according to the literature , the resulting stress in implants is concentrated on the 
 bone crest , which is in agreement 
 with the results obtained in this study , in which the maximum seqv stresses occurred on 
 the mesial side in the neck region of the implant , as reported elsewhere . 
 it has been stated that the ideal tooth - implant supported fixed dentures are those in 
 which the space between the abutments is small , including only one tooth and one 
 implant , with the possibility of a maximum of two pontics . 
 this configuration is necessary because the flexion of 
 the bar is proportional to the cube of the length of the edentulous space , in agreement 
 with the findings of this study , in which it was observed a greater displacement in the 
 pontic region , and higher tension located between the pontic and the abutments . 
 according to the quantitative and qualitative analysis of the present study , it may be 
 concluded that : tooth - implant - supported prostheses must be limited with regard to the edentulous 
 space and it is a feasible and biomechanically predictable treatment option ; the placement of additional teeth decrease the resultant stress values ; the type of alloy used in the metallic infrastructure plays a key role in denture 
 displacement , and preference should be given to those with the highest modulus of 
 elasticity . 
 the internal connection type of implant provides greater rigidity to the set 
 ( abutment / implant ) mechanically presenting lower stress levels .","ideal tooth implant supported fixed dentures tisfds space small including one tooth one implant possibility maximum two pontics

"in many instances , oral implants provide ideal replacement of missing teeth . although the overall implant outcome is favourable , implant - related mechanical and biological complications are still frequently encountered . 
 one of the contributing factors that influence the longevity of implant prosthesis is dental occlusion . 
 uncontrolled occlusal forces can lead to implant overloading and detrimental stresses development.1 strains beyond the physiological limit of bone can evoke bone loss around implants and eventual failure of the implant.2 mechanically , excessive strains on implants can cause different failure types involving the implant , its components , or the prosthesis.13 as a result , it is reasonable to propose an occlusion scheme that will minimize the stresses applied on the implant , without compromising the function and the esthetics of the prosthesis.123 in the literature , several occlusion schemes were described for natural teeth.45678 although they are similar in maximal intercuspation ( mi ) , they vary significantly during excursion . 
 the most commonly described occlusion schemes are canine - guided ( cg ) occlusion , group function ( gf ) occlusion , and balanced occlusion.4 cg occlusion occurs when the overlap between the maxillary and mandibular canine teeth disengages the posterior teeth during excursive movements.9 it relies on the anatomy and proprioceptive abilities of canine teeth.10 gf occlusion is described as multiple lateral occlusal contacts on the working side.9 the simultaneous contacts are thought to distribute occlusal forces.56 balanced occlusion is distinguished with the presence of simultaneous contacts on working and non - working sides during excursion.9 however , due to the expected risks associated with balanced occlusion , there has been a recommendation to avoid this scheme.11 another occlusion scheme described in the literature and has been observed naturally is the long centric ( lc ) occlusion , where many teeth maintain the contact in the initial stages of excursion , followed by cg occlusion at the later stages of excursion.12 these schemes are relevant as they have been commonly used to restore teeth and exist in the natural dentitions.13 biomechanically , key differences exist between natural teeth and osseointegrated implants . 
 the natural tooth root is retained within the alveolar bone by periodontal ligament ( pdl ) , which absorbs and distributes forces applied on the tooth . 
 furthermore , the pdl maintains inherent mobility of the natural tooth.1 in addition , the pdl provides proprioception feature , which allows for protection against occlusal overload . on the other hand 
 , pdl is missing between alveolar bone and implant , and the implant is directly anchored within the bone with a movement of 20 times less than natural tooth movement.1 due to the lack of pdl , the proprioception around the implant is reduced.1 therefore , due to the inherent lack of implant mobility and reduced proprioception , the implant and its prosthesis are prone to overloading . during normal mastication 
 , teeth become compressed in their sockets , leaving the implant prosthesis in hyperocclusion.13 as a consequence of overloading , the implant may suffer from alveolar bone loss14 and mechanical complications , such as ceramic chipping , screw loosening , or components fracture.21516 to overcome the inherent limitations of implant prosthesis , occlusal considerations were discussed in the literature for the purpose of reducing the implant overloading.1718192021 an occlusion scheme specific to implant prosthesis is termed implant - protected ( ip ) occlusion.123 in light occlusion , the prosthesis should not be touching the opposing tooth . however , under heavy biting forces , the prosthesis should be in light contact as the natural teeth are intruded.1 in the excursions , there should be no contact on the implant prosthesis laterally . instead 
 however , in order to provide objective recommendation , it is beneficial to validate the impact of different occlusion schemes . 
 therefore , the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of four different occlusion schemes and different excursive positions on peri - implant strains of a maxillary canine implant . 
 the hypotheses are ( 1 ) there is an effect of occlusion scheme on peri - implant strains , and ( 2 ) there is an effect of the excursive position on peri - implant strains . 
 the right canine of the maxillary model was trimmed . the maxillary and mandibular models were replicated by laboratory silicone ( pinkysil addition cured silicone ; barnes , bankstown , nsw ) . 
 methylmethacrylate resin ( vertex self - curing resin ; henry schein , waterloo , nsw ) was poured in the silicone moulds and heat flasked according to the manufacturer 's instructions . 
 methylmethacrylate resin was selected because it 's young 's modulus is relatively similar to human bone . 
 the generated maxillary and mandibular resin models were articulated on a hanau modular articulator ( 014503 - 000 ; whip mix , louisville , kentucky ) using average values . 
 the occlusion was rechecked for maximum intercuspation and lateral gf occlusion was achieved on both sides . 
 initial gf occlusion was selected as it allowed alteration of the occlusion scheme by modifying the canine palatal anatomy . 
 implant drills were used to create an ideal vertical hole in the area of the maxillary right canine , which was slightly larger than the implant diameter . 
 the hole was filled with freshly mixed methylmethacrylate resin and an implant ( 5.0 mm diameter , 13 mm long branemark mk iii external hex implant , nobel biocare ) was inserted in the hole simultaneously . 
 the model was returned to the heat flask to complete the curing of the resin . 
 four different crowns were fabricated for the purpose of achieving four different lateral occlusion schemes on the right side . 
 a wide platform prefabricated titanium abutment ( branemark snappy abutment , nobel biocare , macquarie park , nsw , australia ) was attached on the implant and torqued to a recommended value of 35 ncm . 
 a cross - pin design was used to avoid screw access in the area of loading and to allow ease of changing the canine crowns while maintaining the same loading set - up ( fig . 
 the abutment was scanned by 3shape scanner ( 3shape d-640 ; wieland - imes , pforzheim , germany ) and each crown was digitally designed to represent a defined lateral occlusion scheme . 
 the applied lateral occlusion schemes were : ( 1 ) cg occlusion , where the overlap between the maxillary and mandibular canines evokes immediate disclusion of the rest of the dentition upon excursion ; ( 2 ) gf occlusion , where all the teeth , including the canines , are in contact during excursion ; ( 3 ) ip occlusion , where the contact between the maxillary and mandibular canines exists only at maximal interscuspation , but not in excursion ; and ( 4 ) lc occlusion , where the occlusion is similar to gf occlusion for the first 1 mm of excursion , after which it changes to cg occlusion . 
 the digital fabrication method was followed to ensure the differences between the crowns were restricted on the palatal guiding surface . 
 a resin pattern for each crown was 3d printed , fitted on the abutment , and verified on the articulator . 
 the most apical part of the crowns was broadened to allow incorporation of the cross - pin . 
 the first point was on the cingulum and corresponded to the maximal intercuspation ( mi ) position . 
 the other points were 1 mm and 2 mm buccal from the mi , which corresponded to the loading after 1 mm and 2 mm excursion , respectively . 
 the three points were selected to allow simulation of occlusal contacts that occurred during functional and parafunctional range of movement.2223 one rectangular stacked 45-degree rosette strain gauge ( vishay precision group , raleigh , nc , usa ) was attached with cyanoacrylate resin ( m bond 200 adhesive vishay micro - measurements , raleigh , nc , usa ) to the mid - buccal crestal area overlaying the implant body . 
 the gauge was composed of three strain foils : horizontal , vertical , and diagonal foils . 
 the model was not moved until the completion of the loading . a linear variable differential transformer ( ldvt ) horizontal arm ( solartron , qc systems pty ltd . , vic , australia ) 
 was placed against the most convex area on the buccal surface of the crown to measure lateral movement under loading . 
 the purpose of the ldvt was to detect any displacement of the crowns during loading . 
 the ldvt was attached to a signal conditioning units ( solartron metrology pty , vic , australia ) . eventually , the data recorded from each measuring tool were monitored by computer software ( lab view 7 express , national instruments corp . , austin , 
 tx , usa ) . for each crown , a computer - controlled precision universal testing machine ( mts 810 materials test system ; mts systems corp . 
 , eden prairie , mn , usa ) was used to apply repeated vertical static load of 140 n at the three marked points ( fig . 
 a 140 n load was chosen as it fits within the physiological load range during mastication.1424 each crown was cycled 10 times to maximum load at each loading site . 
 therefore , a total of 30 readings were generated for every lateral occlusion scheme . for each loading condition , 
 the strain generated from each gauge foil ( vertical , horizontal , and diagonal ) was recorded . 
 subsequently , maximum and minimum principal strain values were calculated for each loading according to the following equations : maximum  principal  strain=1+32 + 12(1-2)2+(2-3)2 
 minimum  principal  strain=1+32 - 12(1-2)2+(2-3)2 where 1 is the horizontal gauge strain , 2 is the vertical gauge strain , and 3 is the diagonal gauge strain . 
 the shear strain was subsequently measured by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum principal strain values : shear strain = maximum principal strain - minimum principal strain the average shear strain and standard deviation were calculated for the 10 readings of each crown and loading site . 
 the effects of crown morphology ( cg , gf , lc , ip ) and loading site ( mi , 1 mm , 2 mm ) were evaluated and the interactions between them were investigated by the two - way analysis of variance test followed by tukey post hoc test at a significance level of 5% . 
 the statistical analysis was performed via spss software package ( ibm spss statistics , version 22 , spss inc . , chicago , il , usa ) . 
 the shear strain values for each crown were plotted in a box and whisker diagram . 
 for all the crowns and excursive positions , the lateral displacement did not exceed 70 m . there was no significant influence of the different occlusion schemes and excursive positions on the lateral displacement . 
 therefore , major crown displacement that could influence the strains measurements was not observed in any loading condition . 
 the shear strain data indicate that the occlusion scheme and the excursive position had effects on localized peri - implant strain magnitude . 
 however , greater impact was detected from altering the excursive position than from altering the occlusion scheme . 
 for all the occlusion schemes , it is clear that as the excursive position moves buccally , the peri - implant strains increases ( fig . 
 , there was a significant difference among the occlusion schemes ( p < .005 ) . 
 gf was associated with the least strains , followed by ip , cg , and lc . at 1 mm , 
 this was followed by ip , cg , and lc ( p < .005 ) . however , the difference was not significant between gf and ip ( p = .65 ) and between cg and lc ( p = .32 ) . at 2 mm , the difference was significant between them ( p < .005 ) . 
 a significant difference existed within the different schemes , except between the ip and lc occlusions ( p = .16 ) . 
 overall , the outcome reflected that at the earlier stages of excursion , gf and ip were associated with the least strain values . 
 however , as the excursion increased , the strains generated from ip became considerably high . 
 regardless of the occlusion scheme , as the excursion increased , the peri - implant strains increased linearly . 
 for all the schemes , the difference in peri - implant strains within the different positions was significant ( p < .005 ) . 
 the 2-way analysis of variance test revealed that there was a significant interaction between the occlusion scheme and the site of loading . 
 the schemes that had less strain values at the mi position tended to have less strain values for the rest of the positions . 
 this study confirms that variation in occlusion scheme and excursive position influences the peri - implant strains . 
 thus , the hypotheses that the peri - implant strain magnitudes would be influenced by the occlusion scheme and the excursive location were accepted . 
 axial forces are preferred as they place the peri - implant bone , implant components , and prosthesis under compression . 
 in addition , the forces are evenly distributed within the peri - implant bone.131516 on the contrary , the non - axial forces are associated with localized stress concentration 1516 and can eventually evoke greater peri - implant strains.14 much of the peri - implant bone strains will be in the crestal region , which is more susceptible to resorption.1516 in this investigation , the occlusion scheme was altered by modifying the canine palatal contour . furthermore , varying the site of load application simulated implant crown loading in maximal intercuspation and excursive positions . 
 it is very clear from this study that the palatal morphology and the excursive position can influence the peri - implant strains , which are most likely related to altering the proportion of axial and non - axial forces on the implant . applying forces on inclined morphology was proven to increase the non - axial forces and the bending moment applied on the implant and the crown,219 as opposed to applying forces on flat surface . as the inclination increases , the lever arm between the point of load application and the fulcrum point at centre of implant increases , which will eventually accentuate the torque . 
 in addition , the non - axial forces will increase by lateral loading of the implant crown . 
 as the occlusal forces move laterally from the implant centre , the implant and the relevant components will be subjected to additional flexion and torqueing.20 tooth morphology plays a considerable role in occlusion . 
 this is particularly evident for the canines due to their location in the corner of the arch , which allows them to control the eccentric movements and the pattern of lateral contacts.410 as an effect of altering the canine morphology , the lateral occlusion scheme can range from cg occlusion to gf or ip occlusions . 
 cg and lc occlusions are associated with greater overlap between the maxillary and mandibular canines to allow for posterior teeth disclusion.17 this has been established in this study by increasing the incline of the canine palatal contour . as a result , these occlusion schemes were associated with greater peri - implant strains at mi and the early stage of excursion . on the contrary , shallow canine palatal morphology , such as in gf or ip occlusions , tends to have less strains at mi and the early stage of excursion ( 1 mm ) . 
 , who found that premolar implant crowns with steeper cusp inclination had greater peri - implant strains than crowns with shallower cusp inclination.19 however , as the excursion extends to 2 mm buccally , a different pattern was observed , and the ip occlusion had experienced a considerable localized increase of peri - implant strains . 
 although ip occlusion is thought to evoke less peri - implant strains , this was not consistently observed through the whole excursion path . 
 this reflects the complexity associated with dental occlusion and palatal contour that can cause variation in the steepness along the excursion path . 
 the crowns were constructed to test the effect of bucco - lingual morphology , but the different crowns exhibited different mesio - distal morphology , which might have had effects on the results . 
 differences in the mesio - distal morphology can cause the load pointer to shift down the ridge mesially or distally . while it may appear minimal 
 , it will lead to strain fluctuation in experiments due to additional torsional strains being superimposed . 
 in addition , although the differences between the occlusion schemes are statistically significant , it is very difficult to speculate the clinical impact of such difference . the high statistical difference can be due to repeating the load application on single crowns . as a result , a low standard deviation was observed . 
 additional experimentation should evaluate multiple crowns in each scheme . in order to simulate the natural pattern of occlusal contacts , each crown was loaded in mi and two excursive positions . 
 these were adopted because it was thought to be clinically relevant and reflect the functional loading on the crown , as several reports pointed that functional occlusal contacts occurred within a range of few millimetres.2223 functional movements , such as chewing and physiological grinding , occur naturally within 0.5 mm from the mi position.78 the excursive range from 0.5 mm to edge - to - edge position is used during parafunctional activities . 
 therefore , the experiment covers the possible occlusal force occurrence during functional and parafunctional range of activities . 
 it is very clear that regardless of occlusion scheme , as the excursion increases , the peri - implant strains increase as well . at mi 
 , the force is directed parallel to the implant which will render the force of compressive nature . however , when the excursion occurs , the force direction will shift buccally , producing a coupling force to the centre of the implant and resulting in a larger bending moment1521 . 
 the increase of peri - implant strains in the excursive positions illustrates the negative consequences of localized stresses during parafucntional activities . 
 it is likely that the implemented occlusion scheme is a less important for implant overloading than the presence of parafunctional activities . 
 this is in accordance with a clinical study that reported a direct relationship between bruxism and increased implant prostheses complications.18 contrary to the occlusion scheme , the excursive position has a greater impact on peri - implant strains . 
 this indicates that the location of the load is much more significant in strain development than the palatal contour of the crowns . 
 therefore , altering the occlusion scheme for the purpose of changing the lateral contact pattern is more important than modifying the crown morphology and cuspal inclination . 
 while this study had loaded all the crowns in all the excursive locations , the load might be different in clinical situations . from the clinical perspective 
 , the canines in cg occlusion and lc occlusions are be the only teeth subjected to lateral forces in excursive positions.9 on the other hand , in gf occlusion , the lateral forces are distributed between the canine and the rest of the posterior teeth on the working side.9 an earlier study had reported that implant prostheses with gf was more comfortable than cg over a period of few months,17 which may be attributed to less restricted mandibular movement.5 while it is attractive to assume that gf is a safer occlusion , other investigators have reported increased chance to grind patients ' teeth in eccentric positions . 
 this has been observed by elevated emg readings of masticatory muscles and increased condylar displacement with gf occlusion.56 cg occlusion exhibits a protective mechanism from the proprioceptive feature of canine teeth . however , whether the proprioceptive mechanism will offset the negative effect of palatal steepness is yet to be determined . 
 nevertheless , ip occlusion will be safer for the implant due to the absence of lateral occlusal contacts . for implant prostheses , 
 several authors suggested using the natural teeth for occlusion guidance and alleviation of occlusal contacts on the implant prosthesis during excursive movement.120 this is envisioned to minimize the nonaxial forces on implant components and reduce the risk of mechanical complications through micromovement or flexure.20 although ip is likely to be beneficial in eliminating lateral contacts on implant restoration , utilizing this scheme for anterior implant restoration may result in shallow morphology and shortened clinical crown that can hinder the dental esthetics . 
 a recent systematic review did not confirm the superiority of any occlusion scheme for teeth or implant prostheses.11 in a retrospective study , kinsel and lin evaluated the effect of lateral occlusion on implant - supported prosthesis complications . 
 patients with gf occlusion had significantly greater chance of ceramic chipping than those with cg . 
 however , the investigators did not relate the ceramic chipping solely to the occlusion scheme . 
 in addition , they have reported more critical factors , such as bruxism and opposing implant prosthesis . on the other hand , 
 several authors have reported there is no specific occlusion scheme that should be implemented for implant restorations . instead , 
 the lateral occlusion scheme for implant prostheses can mimic the the occlusion scheme on tooth supported prostheses.113 as a result , no specific occlusion scheme will be selected for all implant prostheses . while this study has the advantage of simulating a clinical scenario , it has some limitations . 
 for example , a true representation of natural cortical bone and trabecular bone is impossible in a laboratory study . 
 this experiment assumes isotropic mechanical behaviour of bone . however , bone is inhomogeneous due to the variations in cortical bone thickness and trabecular bone porosity . as a result , 
 variation in bone quality may react differently to occlusal forces.14 in addition , laboratory experimentations assume complete implant integration , which does not represent actual implant osseointegration . 
 within the limitations of this preliminary study , it can be concluded that the occlusion scheme and the excursive position influence the peri - implant strains . according to the present experimental set - up 
 , it appears that the impact of eccentric position is greater than that of the occlusion scheme . implementing an occlusion concept that reduces the occurrence of occlusal contacts in excursive positions is preferable to reduce the strains within the peri - implant region .","commonly described occlusion schemes canine guided cg occlusion group function gf occlusion balanced occlusion cg occlusion occurs overlap maxillary mandibular canine teeth disengages posterior teeth excursive movements relies anatomy proprioceptive abilities canine teeth gf occlusion described multiple lateral occlusal contacts working side simultaneous contacts thought distribute occlusal forces balanced occlusion distinguished presence simultaneous contacts working non working sides excursion however due expected risks associated balanced occlusion recommendation avoid scheme another occlusion scheme described literature observed naturally long centric lc occlusion many teeth maintain contact initial stages excursion followed cg occlusion later stages excursion schemes relevant commonly used restore teeth exist natural dentitions biomechanically key differences exist natural teeth osseointegrated implants

"as is the most common cause of left ventricular outflow obstruction in children and adults . it is most common type of valvular heart disease in europe and north america , occurring in 27% of the population over 65 years of age . 
 medical therapy alone is not effective for the long - term management of aortic valve disease , thus valve replacement remains the standard of care in patients with an acceptable risk profile . 
 we present a case of critical as with significant symptom manifested as chest pain that was managed successfully without surgical avr or tavr . 
 we will also briefly review incidence , etiology , grading of as and current guidelines for avr . 
 a 91-year - old gentleman with history of hypertension , dyslipidemia and as presented to our office on 7/2015 with complaints of new onset sub sternal burning pain of 6 weeks duration . 
 prior to 6 weeks patient could walk 2 blocks on level ground without shortness of breath or chest pain . 
 blood pressure was 140/90 mm hg and pulse was regular at 60 beats per minute . 
 cardiovascular exam revealed a grade 4/6 ejection systolic murmur best heard in the right second intercostal region radiating bilaterally to the neck . 
 ecg revealed left ventricular hypertrophy ( lvh ) with non specific st - t wave changes in inferior leads ( figure 1 ) . 
 echocardiography ( echo ) done in may of 2014 had revealed critical as with aortic valve area of 0.6 - 0.7 centimeter square and ejection fraction of 65 percent . the aortic valve ( av ) was heavily calcified . 
 aortic valve peak velocity ( av vmax ) 4.66 m / s ( figure 2 ) . 
 the patient was directly referred for a cardiac catheterization to evaluate his coronary anatomy prior to avr . 
 hemodynamic measurement revealed left ventricle ( lv ) pressure 240/0 with left ventricular end diastolic pressure ( lvedp ) of 10 . 
 pulmonary artery wedge pressure ( pawp ) , mean of 24 , right atrium ( ra ) mean of 8 , right ventricle ( rv ) 60/10 with an right ventricular end diastolic pressure ( rvedp ) of 14 , pulmonary artery ( pa ) 60/17 . 
 the aortic valve area was calculated at 0.6 centimeter square , which was unchanged from echo done may 1 , 2014 . 
 the left ventriculogram in the right anterior oblique ( rao ) view revealed normal lv systolic motion and ejection fraction of 55 - 60 percent . left main coronary artery revealed a common ostium - giving rise to the left anterior descending ( lad ) and the circumflex . 
 right coronary artery ( rca ) revealed a 99 % ostial narrowing ( figure 3 ) . 
 lad revealed a 60 % narrowing in its proximal segment and a 90% ostial diagonal narrowing ( figure 4 ) . 
 after a detailed discussion involving the patient , his son , interventional cardiologist and the cardio thoracic surgeon , patient requested that only pci of the rca be considered , as the chest pain was of recent duration with no change in aortic valve finding . 
 thus , a successful pci was done in the proximal rca with a bare metal stent ( figure 6 ) . 
 patient did extremely well after pci of the rca and the patient has remained asymptomatic to date . 
 thus , this new onset chest pain in patient with critical as was due to concomitant coronary artery lesion and was amenable to stenting and thus spared this elderly patient from the aortic valve replacement which would have been a high risk surgery for him . 
 as is the most common valvular heart condition in the developed world , affecting 3% of people between ages 75 and 85 and 4% of people over age 85 . 
 congenitally unicuspid , bicuspid , tricuspid , or even quadricuspid valves may be the cause of as . in adults who develop symptoms from congenital as 
 the main causes of acquired as include degenerative calcification and , less commonly , rheumatic heart disease . 
 other , infrequent causes of as include obstructive vegetations , homozygous type ii hypercholesterolemia , paget disease , fabry disease , ochronosis , and irradiation . based upon a variety of hemodynamic and natural history data 
 , clinicians generally grade the severity of stenosis as mild , moderate , severe , or critical . 
 grading of as are as follows : i ) mild : valve area exceeds 1.5 cm ; transvalvular velocity 2.0 to 2.9 m / s ; mean gradient < 20 mmhg ; ii ) moderate : valve area of 1.0 to 1.5 cm ; transvalvular velocity 3.0 to 3.9 m / s ; mean gradient 20 to 39 mmhg ; iii ) severe : valve area is less than 1.0 cm ; transvalvular velocity 4 m / s ; mean gradient 40 mmhg . 
 the term critical stenosis was defined based upon theoretical considerations showing that the aortic valve area must be reduced to one - fourth of its natural size before significant changes in circulation occur . as a result , since the triangular orifice area of the normal ( adult ) aortic valve is approximately 3.0 cm , an area exceeding 0.75 cm would not be defined as critical . 
 avr and tavr remain the only treatment proven to reduce the rates of mortality and morbidity in this condition . under current guidelines , the onset of symptoms of exertional angina , syncope and dyspnea in a patient who has severe as is a class i indication for surgery . 
 the annual rate of sudden death in patients with this condition is estimated at 1% to 3% but the surgical mortality rate in avr has been as high as 6% . with improvements in surgical techniques and prostheses , mortality rates have been reduced to 2.42% making a case for earlier intervention . 
 tavr has become widely available , but further investigation into its use in this patient cohort is warranted . while assessing the cases of asymptomatic as we have both traditional as well as novel markers at our disposal now . left ventricular ejection fraction ( lvef ) < 50 percent , peak aortic jet velocity > 4.0 m / s , valve area < 1 cm and mean pressure gradient > 40 mm hg are the traditional markers to denote severe as in asymptomatic patients . while , indexed left atrial size > 12.2 cm / m , lvh with wall thickness > 15 mm , global left ventricular longitudinal strain < 15.9 , bnp ( b - natriuretic peptide ) level > 130 pg / ml and increase in mean pressure gradient of > 20 mm hg during exercise testing are the novel markers of asymptomatic severe as . 
 bnp level does not appear to be significantly associated with the degree of as severity but does reflect heart failure status . 
 the american college of cardiology and american heart association ( acc / aha ) have issued the following recommendations for avr , based on the severity of stenosis and on whether the patient has symptoms : i ) severe stenosis , with symptoms : class i recommendation ( surgery should be done ) . without surgery , 
 these patients have a very poor prognosis , with an overall mortality rate of 75% at 3 years ; ii ) severe stenosis , no symptoms , in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication ( example coronary artery bypass grafting , ascending aortic surgery , or surgery on other valves ) : class i recommendation for concomitant aortic valve replacement ; iii ) moderate stenosis , no symptoms , in patients undergoing cardiac surgery for another indication : class iia recommendation ( i.e. , aortic valve replacement is reasonable ) ; iv ) very severe stenosis ( aortic peak velocity > 5.0 m / s or mean pressure gradient 60 mm hg ) , no symptoms , and low risk of death during surgery : class iia recommendation ; v ) severe stenosis , no symptoms , and an increase in transaortic velocity of 0.3 m / s or more per year on serial testing or in patients considered to be at high risk for rapid disease progression , such as elderly patients with severe calcification : class iib recommendation ( surgery can be considered ) . 
 on revisiting the above case description we realize that the patient did have critical as but was asymptomatic . 
 his chest pain was only due to concomitant coronary artery disease but was not due to as per se . 
 age and comorbidity of the patient posed a high risk for coronary artery bypass graft ( cabg ) with avr . 
 besides , the patient s symptoms were of new onset and subsequent cardiac catheterization revealing critical rca stenosis and the patient s preference for treating the cause of his recent symptoms , encouraged us to think otherwise . the decision to perform pci alone with the belief that this chest pain and cad would be amenable to the minimal risk procedure paid dividends . 
 in addition , patient received a bare metal stent with the option of undergoing surgical avr if symptoms were not relieved . 
 awareness amongst physicians about the fact that all critical aortic stenosis with chest pain may not require aortic valve replacement is important . 
 this can lead to less invasive treatment tailored to the need of the patient especially in those with advanced age , significant comorbidities and an extremely high risk for cabg with avr and can also result in decreased cost of care . 
 pharmacological nuclear stress testing may be another modality that can be used to differentiate etiology of the symptoms .","echocardiography echo done may revealed critical aortic valve area centimeter square ejection fraction percent

 it is a class i indication that symptomatic patients with critical as undergo either surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( tavr ) . 
 we present a patient with critical as and new angina that was managed successfully with percutaneous coronary intervention ( pci ) of the right coronary artery . 
 physicians should consider that not all patients with critical as and angina necessarily require avr . 
 concomitant pathology leading to the symptoms should be carefully ruled out . 
 this leads to a less invasive , cost effective care plan especially in patients with advanced age and comorbidities for which any type of surgical valvular intervention may pose high risk ."

 end assay and measurements of type i interferon production : the end assay 
 was conducted using bfm cells as described previously . in brief , 
 bfm cells grown in 96-well plates were infected with bvdv and 
 incubated for 5 days at 37c in 5% co2 . 
 the end 
 phenomenon was regarded as positive , if strong cpe was observed in ndv - infected cells . 
 measurements of type i interferon production in bvdv - infected cells were performed using a 
 previously described plaque reduction method with vsv as a challenge virus , with some modifications . in brief , the supernatants 
 from bvdv - infected cells were inactivated by exposure to uv light ( 254 nm ) in the uv 
 crosslinker ( atto corporation , tokyo , japan ) under the condition of 500 mj / cm . 
 viral inactivation of samples was confirmed using indirect fa techniques with anti - bvdv ns3 
 monoclonal antibody # 46/1   after inoculation of 
 samples onto mdbk - hs cells and incubation for 2 days at 37c in 5% co2 . 
 then , 
 monolayers of sk - l cells in 12-well plates were inoculated with 1 ml of a 
 four - fold dilution of uv - inactivated supernatant and incubated for 24 hr at 37c in 5% 
 co2 . 
 interferon titers were expressed as reciprocals of dilutions that reduced the number of 
 challenge viral plaques by 50% . 
 detection of irf-3 in bvdv - infected cells by sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide 
 gel electrophoresis ( sds - page ) and western blotting : sds - page and western 
 blotting were performed as described previously . 
 bfm cells were infected with bvdv ( m.o.i . of 1 ) in six - well plates and incubated for 5 days 
 at 37c in 5% co2 . 
 after 
 transferring the proteins from the gels to the immunobilion - p transfer membrane ( millipore , 
 billerica , ma , u.s.a . ) , the membranes were treated with anti - human irf-3 rabbit polyclonal 
 antibodies ( genetex , hsinchu city , taiwan ) , goat anti - rabbit igg - hrp conjugate ( bio - rad ) and 
 immunobilion western detection reagents ( millipore ) , in that order . 
 the membranes were read 
 using lumi vision pro ( aishin seiki , kariya , japan ) , and specific bands for irf-3 were 
 detected . 
 cloning of a pair of end/ end viruses from the bvdv gbk 
 strain and determining their whole genome sequences : a pair of end 
 and end viruses ( gbk_e and gbk_e , respectively ) was 
 cloned from the bvdv gbk strain by means of reverse plaque formation techniques and limited 
 dilution . 
 the genomes of gbk_e and gbk_e viruses were both 12,284 
 nucleotides in length and encoded 3,897 deduced amino acids . 
 comparison of the complete 
 genome sequences of both viruses revealed only six nucleotide and four amino acid 
 differences ( d136 g , i2623v , d3148 g and d3502y , the numbers refer to the amino acid position 
 in gbk_e ) between the two viruses ( table

 generation and characterization of in vitro - rescued viruses : the 
 infectious bvdv vgbk_e was successfully rescued by electroporation of mdbk - hs 
 cells with viral rna transcribed in vitro from a full - length pcr amplicon 
 obtained from a cdna clone pgbk_e . 
 the mutant viruses 
 vgbk_e / d136 g , vgbk_e / i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y and 
 vgbk_e / d136 g ; i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y were also recovered from full - length cdna 
 clones . 
 sequencing of the complete genomes of these three viruses confirmed the mutations at 
 the desired amino acid positions and demonstrated the lack of any other mutations in 
 comparison with the parental gbk_e virus . to investigate the biological properties of the mutant viruses , 
 bfm cells were inoculated 
 with both the parental gbk_e and the in vitro - rescued 
 vgbk_e viruses . 
 the results revealed that both gbk_e and 
 vgbk_e were ncp ( data not shown ) and exhibited the end phenomenon

 gbk_e , vgbk_e / d136 g or vgbk_e / d136 g ; i2623v ; 
 d3148 g ; d3502y did not exhibit cpe ( end ) 
 in addition , titration of both viruses in mdbk - hs cells revealed that 
 vgbk_e exhibited the same growth characteristics as wild - type 
 gbk_e ( data not shown ) . 
 moreover , compared with the wild - type 
 gbk_e strain , other in vitro - rescued viruses grew equally in

 an end assay revealed that the 
 vgbk_e / d136 g and vgbk_e / d136 g ; i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y viruses were 
 changed to end ; bfm cells infected with these viruses did not exhibit cpe after 
 ndv superinfection . in contrast , the vgbk_e / i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y virus 
 remained end ; bfm cells infected with this virus exhibited clear cpe after 
 superinfection with ndv , as observed in bfm cells infected with gbk_e ( fig .

 vgbk_e / d136 g ; i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y was measured in sk - l cells . 
 secretion of 
 type i interferon was inhibited in bfm cells infected with gbk_e , 
 vgbk_e or the virus carrying the mutations without npro 
 ( vgbk_e / i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y ) , which is in consistent with the results 
 from the end assay . 
 cells infected with gbk_e or viruses carrying mutations in 
 n(vgbk_e / d136 g and vgbk_e / d136 g ; i2623v ; d3148 g ;

 these results clearly indicate that the aspartic acid of n(at position 136 
 of the gbk_e strain ) is the key amino acid residue that determines the capacity 
 to inhibit the production of type i interferon and induce the end phenomenon . 
 detection of irf-3 in cells infected with the parental or mutant viruses : 
 to investigate the expression levels of irf-3 in bvdv - infected cells , irf-3 in the lysates 
 of bfm cells infected with gbk_e , gbk_e , vgbk_e or one

 both bvdv and csfv inhibit the production of type i interferon in vitro 
 through proteasomal degradation of cellular irf-3 [ 1 , 
 4 , 8 , 28 ] . 
 cells infected with these ( end ) viruses 
 exhibit strong cpe after superinfection with ndv or some orbiviruses [ 15 , 20 ] . 
 one of the two domains of 
 pestivirus n , the c - terminal domain containing a zinc - binding trash motif 
 consisting of cys112-cys134-asp136-cys138 , is required for irf-3 binding and prevention of 
 type i interferon production [ 7 , 32 ] . for csfv , it has been reported that mutations at positions 112 , 134 , 
 136 or 138 in n of end viruses abolish the inhibition of type i 
 interferon production , while mutations at positions 112 or 136 in n of 
 end viruses restore this function [ 24 , 
 32 , 33 ] . for 
 bvdv 
 , previous studies have revealed that amino acid substitutions l8p , e22v or h49l in 
 n abolish its capacity to interfere with type i interferon production [ 2 , 6 ] . however , to 
 the best of our knowledge , there were no studies with bvdv that had approached the basic 
 mechanism of the inhibition of type i interferon production using the amino acid differences 
 between a pair of end and end viruses as well as viruses genetically 
 engineered on the basis of these differences . 
 pestiviruses are quasispecies ; single strains 
 consist of populations with various characteristics , such as end and 
 end . 
 we cloned a pair of 
 end and end viruses ( gbk_e and gbk_e ) from 
 the bvdv gbk strain using reverse plaque formation techniques [ 5 , 19 ] . 
 determination of complete 
 genome sequences of these viruses revealed that there were only four amino acid differences 
 between them ( table 1 ) . to clarify the molecular 
 mechanism of the inhibition of type i interferon production and the end phenomenon 
 , we 
 generated a full - length cdna clone of gbk_e ( pgbk_e ) as well as 
 three other full - length cdna clones with single ( d136 g ) or multiple ( i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y 
 and d136 g ; i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y ) mutations . 
 the ifn bioassay of vgbk_e and three mutant viruses revealed 
 that vgbk_e and vgbk_e / i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y exhibited the end 
 phenomenon and inhibited the production of type i interferon , whereas the n 
 mutant viruses vgbk_e 
 / d136 g and vgbk_e / d136 g ; i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y 
 were end and did not inhibit the production of type i interferon ( fig . 
 this result demonstrates that the single aspartic acid residue in the 
 zinc - binding trash motif of n , which occurs at position 136 of the genome of 
 the gbk_e virus , is the key to determine viral capacity to inhibit type i 
 interferon production and display the end phenomenon . 
 because it has been reported that the 
 n proteins of both bvdv and csfv inhibit the production of type i interferon 
 by proteasomal degradation of cellular irf-3 [ 1 , 4 , 8 , 28 ] , we assessed whether n of wild - type 
 gbk_e , wild - type gbk_e , vgbk_e and the three mutant 
 viruses reduced the amount of cellular irf-3 in infected cells by western blotting . an 
 apparent reduction in cellular irf-3 was observed in cells infected with wild - type 
 gbk_e , vgbk_e or vgbk_e / i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y , 
 whereas wild - type gbk_e and mutant viruses with mutations in n 
 showed no reduction in cellular irf-3 ( fig . 
 the results indicate that the inhibition of type i interferon production and the 
 end phenomenon displayed by gbk_e occurs by the degradation of cellular irf-3 
 caused by combining with the zinc - binding trash motif . 
 comparison of 
 vgbk_e / d136 g ; i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y ( the same amino acid sequence as 
 gbk_e ) with vgbk_e / i2623v ; d3148 g ; d3502y revealed that the 
 function of n was restored by a single g136d mutation in n of 
 the gbk_e virus . in the present study , 
 a comparison of the amino acid sequences of gbk_e , 
 gbk_e and viruses from ddbj / embl / genbank databases revealed that amino acid 
 residues cys112-cys134-asp136-cys138 in the zinc - binding trash motif of n were 
 well conserved among field bvdv isolates ( fig . 
 it is reported that these four residues are required for the inhibition of type i interferon 
 production [ 7 , 32 ] . taken together , the above - mentioned results suggest that these field isolates 
 inhibit the type i interferon production in infected cells , although there remains a 
 possibility that amino acid residues other than those of trash motif contribute to this 
 phenomenon . 
 the g strain contains the amino acid residue glu136 in the trash motif of 
 n ( fig . 
 4 ) , and this may affect 
 the structure of n and result in the production of type i interferon 
 in vitro . it was reported that 35 out of 45 ( 77.8% ) field isolates of 
 bvdv in japan contained end virus as the predominant virus population compared 
 with end virus and seven isolates ( 15.6% ) contained similar titers of 
 end and end viruses , whereas two isolates ( 4.4% ) contained only 
 end virus . 
 therefore , further 
 studies are needed to investigate how quasispecies of bvdv ( end and 
 end ) contribute in vivo . in conclusion , 
 our results indicate that a single mutation in the trash motif at position 
 136 of bvdv n abolishes its interaction with bovine irf-3 and halts the 
 degradation of irf-3 . 
 moreover , the mutation of the amino acid residue at position 136 of 
 gbk_e restores its function as an interferon antagonist , as shown for csfv . 
 however , how n interacts with irf-3 and the nature of the cascade after 
 interaction with n and irf-3 are hardly understood . 
 in addition , it is unknown 
 how the inhibition of type i interferon production contributes to the viral infection 
 strategy when cells are infected with bvdv in vivo . 
 therefore , an 
 additional study is also required to reveal the fundamental mechanism by which pestiviruses 
 inhibit the production of type i interferon and how this mechanism functions in 
 vivo .","cells infected gbke vgbke vgbke iv g dy exhibited distinguishable cpe superinfection ndv end whereas infected gbke vgbke g vgbke g iv g dy exhibit cpe end addition titration viruses mdbk hs cells revealed vgbke exhibited growth characteristics wild type gbke data shown

 inhibition of type i interferon in pestivirus - infected cells in vitro , 
 via proteasomal degradation of cellular interferon regulatory factor ( irf)-3 with the 
 property of the viral autoprotease protein npro . reportedly , the amino acid 
 residues in the zinc - binding trash motif of npro determine the difference in 
 characteristics between end - phenomenon - positive ( end+ ) and 
 end - phenomenon - negative ( end ) classical swine fever viruses ( csfvs ) . 
 however , 
 the basic mechanism underlying this function in bovine viral diarrhea virus ( bvdv ) has not 
 been elucidated from the genomic differences between end+ and end 
 viruses using reverse genetics till date . in the present study , comparison of complete 
 genome sequences of a pair of end+ and end viruses isolated from 
 the same virus stock revealed that there were only four amino acid substitutions 
 ( d136 g , 
 i2623v , d3148 g and d3502y ) between two viruses . based on these differences , viruses with 
 and without mutations at these positions were generated using reverse genetics . 
 the end 
 assay , measurements of induced type i interferon and irf-3 detection in cells infected 
 with these viruses revealed that the aspartic acid at position 136 in the zinc - binding 
 trash motif of npro was required to inhibit the production of type i interferon 
 via the degradation of cellular irf-3 , consistently with csfv ."
"the converge consortium has obtained a large number of samples ( including 5,303 cases of mdd and 5,337 controls , all chinese subjects ) for inclusion in genome - wide association studies ( gwas ) . 
 snp rs35936514 in the lhpp gene has been reported to be significantly associated with mdd at a genome - wide level . 
 lhpp encodes an enzyme known as phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate phosphatase ( lhpp ) , which was originally purified from swine brain tissue   and shows high levels of expression in the brain [ 3 , 4 ] . 
 this region of the genome has been implicated in the etiology of mdd using a combination of linkage and association analysis . 
 lhpp or a product of a collinear brain - specific transcript , therefore , may interact with htr1a in the pathogenesis of major depression . 
 a recent study has extended the findings of previous literature by supporting the role of lhpp in risk for mdd . 
 a single study has shown the expression of lhppase to be associated with thyroid function , which could be interesting given that thyroid disorder is thought to mediate the functional regulation of mdd patients . a link between thyroid function and depression 
 any impairment of thyroid function supply to the developing cns causes severe changes to the overall architecture and function of human brain , leading to various neurological dysfunctions [ 912 ] . 
 recently , genetic imaging has been used to investigate the association of genetic variation with neuroimaging endophenotypes . 
 genetic imaging is an emerging field that is rapidly identifying genes that influence the brain , cognition , or risk for diseases . along with clinical diagnosis , 
 it has fostered new enthusiasm in depression research , because this approach allows for assessing the neural impact of candidate genes in vivo and thus provides for a new level of evidence [ 17 , 18 ] . 
 resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rs - fmri ) is often used to examine mental disorders . 
 the amplitude of low - frequency fluctuations ( alff ) is thought to detect the intensity of spontaneous neural activity at rest . 
 it has been considered a reliable and sensitive measure to study both healthy and clinical populations [ 2022 ] . 
 the effects of the neural system and their association with lhpp variation in the context of mdd are not yet understood . 
 identifying previously unknown physiological pathways can open new avenues for the development of novel depression drugs . in the present study 
 , the association of lhpp rs35936514 with the resting - state brain activity was measured using alff . 
 it is here hypothesized that variations in rs35936514 may influence spontaneous brain activity at rest in mdd patients . 
 45 mdd patients ( mean age 27.13  sd  12.65 years , range 1359 years , 71% female ) were recruited from the outpatients at the department of psychiatry , the first hospital of china medical university , and the mental health center of shenyang . 
 the diagnosis of mdd was confirmed by 2 trained psychiatrists using the structured clinical interview for dsm - iv disorders ( scid ) . 
 scores on the 17-item hamilton rating scale for depression ( hamd ) were obtained from each participant except for one , who did not complete these evaluations . here , 115 healthy control ( hc ) subjects ( mean age 33.96  sd  14.25 years , range 758 years , 57% female ) without any personal history of any axis i disorder or first - degree family member with a major mood or psychotic disorders were recruited through surrounding communities . 
 exclusion criteria for both groups included history of neurological disease , loss of consciousness 5  min , any medical condition that might affect neurovascular function including hypertension , current substance abuse , or dependence , and having contraindications for mri . 
 all participants provided written informed consent after receiving a complete description of the study as approved by the institutional review board of the china medical university . 
 subjects were further divided into two groups : a cc group homozygous for the c allele ( 23 mdd , 57 hc ; mean age = 34.06  14.45 years , 60% female ) and risk t - carrier group ( ct / tt genotypes ; = 22 mdd , 58 hc ; mean age = 30.02  13.57 years , 61% female ) . 
 genotype frequencies were consistent with hardy - weinberg equilibrium expectation ( mdd :  = 2.894 , p = 0.08 ; hc :  = 2.52 , p = 0.11 ) . 
 the mri data were acquired using a ge signa hdx 3.0 t mri scanner ( general electric , us ) in the department of radiology of the first hospital of china medical university . 
 soft pads and earplugs were used when scanning to restrict head motion and reduce scanner noise . 
 participants were asked to relax with their eyes closed but remain awake throughout the resting - state scan . 
 three - dimensional t1-weighted images were obtained using a fast spoiled gradient - echo ( fspgr ) sequence : repetition time ( tr ) = 7.1  ms , echo time ( te ) = 3.2  ms , field of view ( fov ) = 24  cm  24  cm , flip angle = 15 , matrix = 240  240 , slice thickness = 1  mm , and no gap . 
 functional images were acquired using a gradient echo planar imaging ( epi ) : tr = 2000  ms , te = 30  ms , fov = 24  cm  24  cm , flip angle = 90 , matrix = 64  64 , slice thickness = 3  mm , no gap , and slices = 35 . 
 the first 10 volumes of each subject were discarded to allow participants to adapt to the scanning environment . 
 the remaining data were preprocessed including slice timing , head motion correction , and spatial normalization to the standard montreal neurological institute ( mni ) space ( resampling to 3  3  3  mm ) . 
 subsequently , the images were spatially smoothed with a 6  mm full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) gaussian kernel . 
 participants with head motion less than 3.0  mm in any dimension or 3 rotation at any point during the course of the scan were included for further analysis . 
 subsequent data preprocessing included removal of linear trends and temporal filtering ( band pass , 0.010.08  hz ) to reduce the effects of low - frequency drift and high - frequency noise . 
 the square root was calculated at each frequency of the power spectrum and averaged square root was between 0.01 and 0.08  hz . 
 the alff of each voxel was divided by the global mean alff value within a brain mask . 
 resting - state fmri data analysis toolkit ( rest ) ( http://www.restfmri.net/ ) was performed for further data processing and alff analysis . 
 demographic data ( sex , age , education , and hamd ) were analyzed using chi - square tests and two - way analysis of variance ( anova ) with diagnostic group ( hc , mdd ) and genotype group ( cc , ct / tt ) as between subject factors . a two - sample t - test was used to compare the durations of illness across genotypes within the mdd group . 
 a voxelwise anova ( 2  2 anova : diagnosis  genotypes ) was used to determine the effects of diagnosis and genotype on alff values , and age and sex were considered as covariates . 
 post hoc t - test was used to explore the details of the main effects and interactions . 
 correction for multiple comparisons was based on monte carlo simulation [ alphasim , analysis of functional neuroimages ( afni ) , cluster size > 3321  mm ] . 
 pearson correlation analyses and spearman correlation analyses were performed to determine the correlation of alff values between regions showing significant differences with the hamd scores , education , and illness duration in the two diagnostic groups . 
 there was no significant effect of diagnosis , genotype , or interaction between diagnosis and genotype for age , sex , or education . 
 the effect of diagnosis in hamd was significant , with significantly higher hamd scores in the mdd group than in the hc group . 
 two - sample t - tests showed no difference in the duration of illness between the mdd subgroups ( table 1 ) . 
 the influence of diagnosis and genotypes on alff in the cc and ct / tt genetic subgroups in the mdd and control subjects is listed in table 2 . after performing a two - way anova on the alff maps , 
 a significant main diagnosis group effect was observed ( f = 56.39 , p < 0.001 , corrected ) . 
 mdd patients showed significantly increased alff in the left middle temporal gyrus and left occipital cortex compared with individuals in hc group ( figure 1 ) . 
 there was also a significant main effect of genotype ( f = 31.80 , p < 0.001 , corrected ) . 
 the t - carrier group showed increased alff in the left superior temporal gyrus ( figure 2 ) . 
 significant diagnosis by genotype interaction was noted ( f = 22.24 , p < 0.001 , corrected ) . among patients with mdd , 
 the t - carrier group had significantly lower alff values in the bilateral lingual gyri than the cc group ( f = 2.92 , p = 0.006 ) . 
 within - genotype comparisons showed that t - carriers with mdd had significantly lower alff in the bilateral lingual gyri than healthy controls who were t - carriers ( f = 4.82 , p = 0.02 ) . 
 in addition , alff were highest in the brain regions of the bilateral dorsal lateral frontal cortex ( dlpfc ) and left medial prefrontal gyrus ( mpfc ) in mdd rs35936514 t - carriers compared to mdd rs35936514 cc homozygotes and both control genotype groups ( p < 0.001 ) ( figure 3 ) . 
 correlation analyses did not show any significant associations between alff and hamd scores , illness duration , or education in mdd or hc groups . 
 based on the large number of samples studied on lhpp rs35936514 associated with mdd in chinese subjects , it was here noted that lhpp was associated with thyroid disorders , which may affect depression . 
 multiple studies have reported that both hypo- and hyperthyroidism may potentially increase the risk of cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration . 
 the association between hypothyroidism and depression might be explained by higher rates of hypercortisolism in depression , which might lead to changes in the hypothalamic - pituitary - thyroid / adrenal ( hpt / hpa ) axes . 
 dysfunctional hpt / hpa axes regulation might be a trait in mdd patients , producing changes in the monoaminergic pathways that modulate hormonal responses . 
 autoimmune thyroiditis which is marked by the presence of thyroid antibodies with normal or abnormal thyroid hormone level is also a major cause for mdd . 
 a bidirectional association between depression and the immune system has been also reported [ 33 , 34 ] . 
 depression has been linked with increased inflammatory markers and depression risk alleles have been found to be associated with regulating genes of the immune response . 
 however , the current work did not show apparent relationship between lhpp , thyroid disorders , and mdd . 
 our present study may provide a new imaging genetics approach to explore their relationships . in order to assess the effects on the neural system associated with lhpp variation and mdd 
 , the current work demonstrated that lhpp rs35936514 snp polymorphism may influence the spontaneous brain activity in individual subjects with mdd and also healthy controls . 
 the spontaneous low - frequency fluctuations ( lff ) of blood oxygenation level - dependent ( bold ) signals at rest have been identified as a biological measure of baseline spontaneous activity in the brain [ 21 , 22 , 36 ] . 
 abnormal alff can reflect pathophysiological states in the regional brain area and may help to locate specific impaired brain regions during the resting state . as an additional advantage 
 , alff can be used to assess neuronal activity within the entire brain . in particular , by rs - fmri , the cortico - limbic - striatal circuits ( including the pfc , hippocampus , amygdala , and striatum ) have been implicated in the dysfunctional regulation in mdd . 
 the current study showed significant interactions between diagnosis and genotype in the bilateral lingual gyri , bilateral dlpfc , and left mpfc . 
 the alterations of alff in the mdd t - carrier group suggest that the risk t allele is associated with abnormal spontaneous activity in mdd . 
 more research is needed to identify the mechanisms by which these regional activities in individuals with mdd may be more vulnerable to the effects of variations in rs35936514 , which render them more vulnerable to genetic liability . 
 however , it remains unknown when and how this interaction could change alff , although many factors could influence the status of mdd [ 3840 ] , which are well established as a risk for mdd . 
 furthermore , expression of multiple genes involved in mdd , and their interaction with the lhpp genotype could make a change in the neural circuits of mdd patients . 
 the parts of the brain in the mpfc are believed to be the neural site of self - referential processing , like the anterior node of the default mode network ( dmn ) . 
 alterations to the mpfc functional networks are involved in the development of mdd [ 43 , 44 ] . 
 altered resting state in the dlpfc of mdd could adversely affect activity during emotional or cognitive regulation . 
 the lingual gyrus has been reported to participate in the visual recognition network and to play a role in the perception of emotions [ 45 , 46 ] . 
 many studies have reported decreased activity in the lingual gyrus [ 45 , 47 , 48 ] in patients with mdd . 
 this may be attributable to different roles and levels of expression of the lhpp gene in different regions of the brain , different structural or functional bases ( activities ) of different brain regions , the combined effects of the t - carrier genotype , and other unknown factors . in this study , 
 independent of genotype , increased alff was observed in the left middle temporal gyrus and left occipital cortex among mdd participants compared to that among hcs . 
 the increased spontaneous activity in the temporal and occipital lobe within mdd patients was consistent with the findings of rs - fmri studies examining depression [ 4951 ] . 
 genotype was found to have an effect on alff in the left superior temporal gyrus . 
 it was higher among t - carriers of the lhpp rs35936514 polymorphism in both the hc and mdd groups than in cc individuals within the respective diagnostic groups . 
 it is here suggested that the mdd rs35936514 t - carriers may function as one of several factors that can be used to diagnose mdd . 
 it is possible that variation in lhpp may contribute to the different alff values in temporal lobe in individuals with or at risk for mdd . in this way , 
 the subgroup with mdd that carries the t allele may be a risk factor to abnormal brain activity . 
 however , exploratory analyses did not reveal significant correlations between alff values in regions of significant group differences and clinical factors within each group . 
 we speculate that the relative small sample size or other clinical factors may limit our ability to detect the relation . 
 one lhpp snp , rs11245316 , was found to confer risk of mdd by qtl - specific association analysis . 
 however , these data do not provide preliminary indications of how genetic variation in high - risk regions influences susceptibility to neural circuits abnormalities in patients with mdd . 
 first , many snps and genes implicated in mdd were not included in the study . 
 gene - gene interaction studies and even pathway studies are needed to search for valid mdd - associated genetic and neuroimaging biomarkers . 
 second , owing to the small sample size , the study placed individuals with ct and tt genotype in a single group . as a result 
 , no analysis of the alff values among 3 genotype groups could be performed , and the effect of the risk t allele could not be established as dominant or codominant . a larger - sample study should be performed to further investigate the effect of genes . 
 in conclusion , the present study demonstrated for the first time that lhpp rs35936514 ct / tt genotype may affect regional brain activity in mdd patients . 
 this suggests that the influence of lhpp variation may be one mechanism that contributes to the neural circuits of mdd .","present study association lhpp rs resting state brain activity measured using alff

"parkinson disease ( pd ) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with widely heterogeneous manifestations , including motor , nonmotor and neuropsychiatric symptoms . 
 it affect~1% of the people older than 60 years.13 the major pathologic feature of pd is the loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta and , consequently , basal ganglia.4,5 sex differences in prevalence , clinical presentations and severity of pd have been reported in some previous studies.69 although the exact sources of these differences in pd are unknown , sex hormones , genetic factors and variations in dopaminergic pathways have been proposed as possible underlying reasons.1014 identifying sexual variations influences prevention , therapeutic strategies and understanding of sex - related neurobiological differences.15,16 exploration of sexual dimorphism in neurologic diseases such as pd has been recently announced as a research need.3 while studies are unanimous about the higher prevalence of pd among men , there are conflicting data regarding sex differences in clinical manifestations , progression and treatment outcome.1723 motor presentations ( ie , tremor and dyskinesia ) , psychological manifestations ( especially depression ) , sleep behavior disorders and cognitive impairment have been reported as potential aspects of sexual dimorphism in pd.1723 however , data are still controversial , inconclusive and even conflicting in some aspects . as an example , a recent randomized clinical trial did not find any sex differences in daily activities and main motor features.24 in addition to lack of comprehensive data , these controversies can be partly due to interrelationship and confounding effects of clinical and demographic variables.3 some clinical features that were previously reported to be sex related failed to show any difference between males and females with pd when controlled for other demographic and clinical variables . 
 for instance , cognitive impairment was reported to be more common in men;9 however , the difference was much less pronounced when the effect of age , level of education and disease severity were taken into account.23 in another large study , univariate analysis showed that daily activity was more impaired in females , but multivariate analysis revealed no significant sex difference.24 having collected comprehensive data on different pd- related and general features , we aimed to further investigate sexual dimorphism in pd . 
 our objective was to determine independent differences in clinical manifestations and subtypes , psychosocial functioning , quality of life ( qol ) and its domains between males and females with idiopathic parkinson s disease ( ipd ) using a powerful statistical approach . 
 our a priori research hypothesis was that females with pd experienced more severe nonmotor manifestations , which would also influence their qol and psychosocial functioning more prominently than males . 
 this study was conducted on 157 consecutive patients with ipd from an outpatient referral movement disorders clinic in tehran , iran , between october 2011 and december 2012 . 
 this was a collaborative project between iran university of medical sciences ( tehran , iran ) and karolinska institute ( stockholm , sweden ) . 
 the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the neurology department at firoozgar clinical research development center ( fcrdc ; affiliated to iran university of medical sciences ) . 
 prior to the launch of the study , all patients were informed about the aims and procedures . 
 all participants provided their verbal informed consent to participate in this study . since the project was designed as an observational research , verbal form of consent was approved by the aforementioned ethics committee . 
 participation in this study was voluntary , and the patients were free to withdraw from the project whenever they decided . 
 furthermore , the identity of research participants was protected , since the data files were anonymous and all names were omitted . 
 recruited patients fulfilled the following inclusion criteria : diagnosis of ipd based on the uk brain bank criteria,25 which was assessed by the same neurologist who was specialized in movement disorders for all participants ; current age of 30 years or older and motor disability in the mild - to - severe range but not in the advanced stages that needs wheelchair or hospitalization according to the hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) criteria ( stage < 5).26 patients with moderate to severe dementia were excluded from the study , as were those with atypical parkinsonism , including multiple system atrophy ( msa ) , progressive supranuclear palsy ( psp ) and vascular or drug - induced parkinsonism . 
 data collection was performed through face - to - face interviews with eligible patients by a trained group of medical interns by means of validated questionnaires and checklists . 
 patients were also examined for clinical assessments and diagnosis by one neurologist specialized in movement disorders . the demographic checklist consisted of baseline variables ( age and sex ) , educational status , history of smoking , comorbidities , duration of pd ( time passed from diagnosis ) and history of levodopa administration . 
 total comorbidity burden was calculated by summing up the number of chronic comorbid conditions in each participant , including depression , hypertension , interstitial heart disease ( ihd ) , diabetes , stroke / transient ischemic attack ( tia ) and osteoporosis . 
 data were collected based on participants self - reports and their medical records at the referral center . 
 clinical characteristics of pd were assessed using the following scales and/or definitions : 
 motor severity : unified parkinson s disease rating scale ( updrs ) subscales i  iv , dyskinesia score ( sum of updrs  part iv items 3234 ) , fluctuation score ( sum of updrs 
 part iv items 3639 ) , h&y staging and schwab and england activities of daily living ( adl);motor subtypes : postural instability 
 gait difficulty ( pigd ) score ( sum of updrs  part iii items concerning rise , gait and postural instability ) and freezing  speech  swallowing ( foss ) score ( sum of updrs  part ii items on freezing , speech and swallowing);predominance of core manifestations : proportion of updrs 
 part iii on motor scores accounted for tremor ( items 2021 ) , rigidity ( item 22 ) , bradykinesia ( items 2326 and 31 ) and gait ( items 2730 ) in percentage;asymmetry index : absolute differences in updrs between sides divided by the total updrs 
 part iii items 2026;axial / limb ratio : sum of updrs  part iii items 18 , 19 , 22 and 2730 divided by the sum of updrs 
 part iii items 2026;other motor symptoms : presence of falls and freezing andnonmotor manifestations : the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) questionnaire to measure anxiety and depression,27 fatigue severity scale ( fss ) to investigate fatigue,28 the mini - nutritional assessment ( mna ) questionnaire together with anthropometric measurements for nutritional status,29 persian - translated and validated version of the scales for outcomes in parkinson s disease 
 psychosocial ( scopa - ps ) questionnaire30 to assess psychosocial functioning and validated persian version of the 39-item pd questionnaire ( pdq-39)31 to evaluate health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) . 
 all clinical assessments were done when the patients were in the  on  state .

 psychosocial ( scopa - ps ) questionnaire30 to assess psychosocial functioning and validated persian version of the 39-item pd questionnaire ( pdq-39)31 to evaluate health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) . 
 all clinical assessments were done when the patients were in the  on  state . 
 statistical descriptions and univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed using the ibm spss statistics for windows , version 23 ( ibm corporation , armonk , ny , usa ) . 
 mean ( standard deviation [ sd ] ) and frequency percentages were used to describe numerical and categorical variables , respectively . 
 smirnov test was applied to check the normality assumption for continuous variables . since the normality of distribution was met , we used parametric tests for between - group comparisons . 
 univariate comparisons between males and females were performed using either independent samples t - test , chi - square test or fisher s exact test where appropriate . 
 we used multivariate linear regression model to adjust the between - group differences in some numeric variables of interest for the baseline differences in disease duration and level of education . a two - tailed p - value of < 0.05 was considered as the threshold to show statistical significant differences . in order to evaluate the strength of each variable to discriminate male and female patients with pd , we applied orthogonal partial least squares  discriminant analysis ( opls - da ) method using simca software , version 14.1 ( mks umetrics ab , ume , sweden ) . unit variance ( uv ) scaling was used to transform crude data prior to the opls - da modeling . 
 the opls - da method divides the systematic variation in the x - block consisting of a comprehensive list of demographic and pd - related features to separate males and females with pd into two model parts . 
 one part models the co - variation between x and y , and another part expresses the x - variation that is not related to y and is shown by the orthogonal component(s ) . 
 this method results in a better class resolution for a discriminant problem such as the case in our study . 
 furthermore , the opls - da method made it possible to compare the strength of different variables with various measurement units and scales to discriminate males and females with pd by means of values of standardized loading , their standard error ( se ) and 95% confidence interval ( ci ) . 
 we visualized findings from the opls - da method by three different plots with the following parameters : 
 score scatter plot : to show the performance of the entire opls - da model to separate males and females where t1 refers to the score of each participant from the main discriminant component in the x - block ( horizontal axis ) , while t2 shows the score of each participant from the y - orthogonal component ( vertical axis);loadings bars : this is a one - dimensional plot representing loading value ( p1 ) of each feature to discriminate males and females based on the main discriminant component of the opls - da model;loadings scatter plot : in this plot , p1 refers to the loading values of each feature from the main discriminant component to discriminate males and females ( horizontal axis ) and p2 represents the loadings of each variable from the y - orthogonal component for the differences between features that are not related to sex ( vertical axis ) .

 data were collected based on participants self - reports and their medical records at the referral center . 
 clinical characteristics of pd were assessed using the following scales and/or definitions : 
 motor severity : unified parkinson s disease rating scale ( updrs ) subscales i  iv , dyskinesia score ( sum of updrs  part iv items 3234 ) , fluctuation score ( sum of updrs  part iv items 3639 ) , h&y staging and schwab and england activities of daily living ( adl);motor subtypes : postural instability 
 gait difficulty ( pigd ) score ( sum of updrs  part iii items concerning rise , gait and postural instability ) and freezing  speech  swallowing ( foss ) score ( sum of updrs  part ii items on freezing , speech and swallowing);predominance of core manifestations : proportion of updrs 
 part iii on motor scores accounted for tremor ( items 2021 ) , rigidity ( item 22 ) , bradykinesia ( items 2326 and 31 ) and gait ( items 2730 ) in percentage;asymmetry index : absolute differences in updrs between sides divided by the total updrs  part iii items 2026;axial / limb ratio : sum of updrs

 all clinical assessments were done when the patients were in the  on  state . 
 statistical descriptions and univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed using the ibm spss statistics for windows , version 23 ( ibm corporation , armonk , ny , usa ) . 
 mean ( standard deviation [ sd ] ) and frequency percentages were used to describe numerical and categorical variables , respectively . 
 smirnov test was applied to check the normality assumption for continuous variables . since the normality of distribution was met , we used parametric tests for between - group comparisons . 
 univariate comparisons between males and females were performed using either independent samples t - test , chi - square test or fisher s exact test where appropriate . 
 we used multivariate linear regression model to adjust the between - group differences in some numeric variables of interest for the baseline differences in disease duration and level of education . a two - tailed p - value of < 0.05 was considered as the threshold to show statistical significant differences . in order to evaluate the strength of each variable to discriminate male and female patients with pd 
 , we applied orthogonal partial least squares  discriminant analysis ( opls - da ) method using simca software , version 14.1 ( mks umetrics ab , ume , sweden ) . unit variance ( uv ) scaling was used to transform crude data prior to the opls - da modeling . 
 the opls - da method divides the systematic variation in the x - block consisting of a comprehensive list of demographic and pd - related features to separate males and females with pd into two model parts . 
 one part models the co - variation between x and y , and another part expresses the x - variation that is not related to y and is shown by the orthogonal component(s ) . 
 this method results in a better class resolution for a discriminant problem such as the case in our study . 
 furthermore , the opls - da method made it possible to compare the strength of different variables with various measurement units and scales to discriminate males and females with pd by means of values of standardized loading , their standard error ( se ) and 95% confidence interval ( ci ) . 
 we visualized findings from the opls - da method by three different plots with the following parameters : 
 score scatter plot : to show the performance of the entire opls - da model to separate males and females where t1 refers to the score of each participant from the main discriminant component in the x - block ( horizontal axis ) , while t2 shows the score of each participant from the y - orthogonal component ( vertical axis);loadings bars : this is a one - dimensional plot representing loading value ( p1 ) of each feature to discriminate males and females based on the main discriminant component of the opls - da model;loadings scatter plot : in this plot , p1 refers to the loading values of each feature from the main discriminant component to discriminate males and females ( horizontal axis ) and p2 represents the loadings of each variable from the y - orthogonal component for the differences between features that are not related to sex ( vertical axis ) .

 overall , 157 individuals consisting of 108 males and 49 females with pd were recruited in our study . 
 table 1 summarizes the results for univariate comparison of the demography , motor severity and medications , motor subtypes , nonmotor features and qol indicators between the two subgroups . 
 the age at pd onset did not significantly differ between males and females ( 55.2 [ sd = 11.6 ] year vs 53.4 [ sd = 12.4 ] year , p=0.384 ) , however , disease duration was longer in females at the time of recruitment ( 6.1 [ sd = 4.9 ] year vs 8.2 [ sd = 5.7 ] year , p=0.023 ) . 
 univariate differences in motor features such as total updrs and freezing score disappeared after adjustment for baseline difference . among nonmotor features , 
 anxiety , depression , fatigue and psychosocial functioning were all significantly more severe in female pd patients ( table 1 ) . 
 after statistical adjustment for the baseline differences in disease duration and level of education , female individuals still showed significantly higher score in anxiety ( mean difference = 2.2 [ 95% ci : 0.54.0 ] , p=0.011 ) and borderline higher score in depression ( mean difference = 1.3 [ 95% ci : 0.22.7 ] , p=0.079 ) . 
 furthermore , female pd patients had significantly worse nutritional status and higher parkinson s disease summary index ( pdsi ) , both of which remained statistically significant after multivariate adjustment ( mean difference for mna score = 1.5 [ 95% ci : 2.5 to 0.4 ] , p=0.009 ; mean difference for pdsi score = 6.9 [ 95% ci : 1.911.8 ] , p=0.006 ) . among different domains of qol , 
 females were significantly worse in mobility ( 40.8 [ sd = 27.4 ] vs 22.5 [ sd = 24.0 ] , p<0.001 ) , emotional well - being ( 39.4 [ sd = 24.4 ] vs 23.5 [ sd = 21.7 ] , p<0.001 ) , social support ( 20.1 [ sd = 25.9 ] vs 7.5 [ sd = 15.9 ] , p<0.001 ) and bodily discomfort ( 33.0 [ sd = 25.3 ] vs 17.2 [ sd = 20.1 ] , p<0.001 ) . 
 all of these differences were still significant even after multivariate adjustment for the baseline differences in disease duration and level of education between males and females , resulting in the mean difference of 11.9 ( 95% ci : 3.520.3 , p=0.006 ) in mobility , 12.5 ( 95% ci : 4.720.3 , p=0.002 ) in emotional well - being and 11.0 ( 95% ci : 0.921.5 , p=0.001 ) and 14.2 ( 95% ci : 6.421.9 , p<0.001 ) in bodily discomfort domain of qol . 
 the opls - da model that fitted the best to our dataset had the overall cross - validated predictive r value of 0.33 . 
 the score scatter plot in figure 1 shows the performance of this model to discriminate males and females with pd . 
 the corresponding loading value of each variable in the opls - da model and its 95% ci are shown in figure 2 , and the loadings scatter plot is illustrated in figure 3 . based on the absolute loading value for each variable in the opls - da model , emotional well - being ( mean = 0.22 , se = 0.14 ) , bodily discomfort ( mean = 0.18 , se = 0.13 ) , social support ( mean = 0.17 , se = 0.19 ) , mobility ( mean = 0.17 , se = 0.04 ) and communication ( mean = 0.12 , se = 0.15 ) domains of qol , together with anxiety ( mean = 0.18 , se = 0.10 ) , depression ( mean = 0.17 , se = 0.08 ) and psychosocial functioning ( mean = 0.16 , se = 0.11 ) , were the strongest features with higher values in favor of females to discriminate the two sexes in pd population ( figures 2 and 3 ) . 
 nutritional status ( mean = 0.13 , se = 0.07 ) , schwab and england adl score ( mean = 0.06 , se = 0.13 ) , and orthostasis ( mean = 0.06 , se = 0.05 ) were also found to be strong discriminators in the model , nevertheless , with higher values in favor of the male pd patients .

 furthermore , female pd patients had significantly worse nutritional status and higher parkinson s disease summary index ( pdsi ) , both of which remained statistically significant after multivariate adjustment ( mean difference for mna score = 1.5 [ 95% ci : 2.5 to 0.4 ] , p=0.009 ; mean difference for pdsi score = 6.9 [ 95% ci : 1.911.8 ] , p=0.006 ) . among different domains of qol , 
 females were significantly worse in mobility ( 40.8 [ sd = 27.4 ] vs 22.5 [ sd = 24.0 ] , p<0.001 ) , emotional well - being ( 39.4 [ sd = 24.4 ] vs 23.5 [ sd = 21.7 ] , p<0.001 ) , social support ( 20.1 [ sd = 25.9 ] vs 7.5 [ sd = 15.9 ] , p<0.001 ) and bodily discomfort ( 33.0 [ sd = 25.3 ] vs 17.2 [ sd = 20.1 ] , p<0.001 ) . all of these differences were still significant even after multivariate adjustment for the baseline differences in disease duration and level of education between males and females , resulting in the mean difference of 11.9 ( 95% ci : 3.520.3 , p=0.006 ) in mobility , 12.5 ( 95% ci : 4.720.3 , p=0.002 ) in emotional well - being and 11.0 ( 95% ci : 0.921.5 , p=0.001 ) and 14.2 ( 95% ci : 6.421.9 , p<0.001 ) in bodily discomfort domain of qol . 
 the opls - da model that fitted the best to our dataset had the overall cross - validated predictive r value of 0.33 . 
 the score scatter plot in figure 1 shows the performance of this model to discriminate males and females with pd . 
 the corresponding loading value of each variable in the opls - da model and its 95% ci are shown in figure 2 , and the loadings scatter plot is illustrated in figure 3 . based on the absolute loading value for each variable in the opls - da model , emotional well - being ( mean = 0.22 , se = 0.14 ) , bodily discomfort ( mean = 0.18 , se = 0.13 ) , social support ( mean = 0.17 , se = 0.19 ) , mobility ( mean = 0.17 , se = 0.04 ) and communication ( mean = 0.12 , se = 0.15 ) domains of qol , together with anxiety ( mean = 0.18 , se = 0.10 ) , depression ( mean = 0.17 , se = 0.08 ) and psychosocial functioning ( mean = 0.16 , se = 0.11 ) , were the strongest features with higher values in favor of females to discriminate the two sexes in pd population ( figures 2 and 3 ) . 
 nutritional status ( mean = 0.13 , se = 0.07 ) , schwab and england adl score ( mean = 0.06 , se = 0.13 ) , and orthostasis ( mean = 0.06 , se = 0.05 ) were also found to be strong discriminators in the model , nevertheless , with higher values in favor of the male pd patients . 
 our study is one of the few attempts to comprehensively investigate sexual dimorphism in pd . 
 we applied powerful multivariate statistical methods to explore independent sex differences in clinical manifestations , hrqol and psychosocial functioning of people with pd . 
 in general , females with pd were significantly worse in psychological features such as anxiety and depression , nutritional status and specific domains of qol , namely , mobility , emotional well - being , social support and bodily discomfort . 
 studies have suggested that emotional symptoms of pd , especially depression , are more common and more severe in females than in males.3234 however , these findings were not approved by a large prospective study , which found no difference in the prevalence or severity of depression evaluated by beck depression inventory ( bdi ) between females and males.24 in our study , females with pd tended to be more affected from psychological symptoms . 
 we found that the scores for anxiety , psychosocial functioning and emotional well - being were all higher among females demonstrating a worse status . 
 conflicting results can be , in part , explained by ethnic , cultural and environmental differences as well as the use of different depression scales . in some cultures and environments , 
 women are more prone to be stigmatized by disabling conditions,35,36 which make them more vulnerable to emotional and psychosocial adverse effects of pd . 
 social and physical well - being , measured separately or as parts of qol questionnaires , are important contributors of patient s qol.37,38 in our study , physical discomfort , including mobility , fatigue and bodily discomfort , was more severe among female participants . 
 this finding is confirmed by previous studies of pd populations,17,34,39 as well as those of general population showing more severe physical discomfort in healthy older women compared to males of the same age group.4042 our results showed that despite the lack of statistically significant difference in social stigma , females displayed worse communication and psychosocial functioning . 
 these sex - related differences can be the consequences of more severe emotional disturbance , physical discomfort , and poorer social supports in females compared to males with pd . in our study , 
 self - reported cognitive impairment was higher in female participants based on the cognition dimension of pdq-39 . 
 in contrast , some studies have suggested that cognitive decline in pd is more severe among males.18,23 nonetheless , as different dimensions of cognitive performance have been shown to be sex related in healthy elderly adults ( for instance , males have better visuospatial ability , while females perform better on face and verbal recognition and semantic fluency tests4345 ) , different dimensions of cognitive performance must be investigated in order to clarify sexual dimorphism of cognition in pd . 
 tremor and dyskinesia are reported to occur more frequently in females,8,18,33 whereas gait disturbance is more common in males.19 however , in line to one prospective study that had also adjusted the differences for the confounding effects of demographics and clinical covariates,24 we also could not find sex - related differences in motor symptoms . 
 sleep quality is the other symptom of pd , which is believed to be sex related , but still remained a controversial issue . 
 rapid eye movement ( rem ) sleep behavior disorder ( rbd ) was reported as a male - related symptom in pd;33,4648 some other sleep disturbances were found to be more severe among females.34,49 we did not find any difference in sleep disturbance between males and females using the nonmotor items of the updrs . 
 a more thorough assessment with a valid and specific tool such as polysomnography is required to investigate sexual dimorphism in sleep disorders in people with pd . 
 the comprehensive list of pd - related features and general aspects of daily life is the most important strength of our study . 
 previous studies have investigated sexual dimorphism in manifestations of pd with rather small sample size not being controlled for the potential confounders.3,50 in our study , we evaluated a large list of variables ( some of which were considered for sexual dimorphism in pd for the first time ) and applied a strong multivariate statistical approach , opls - da , to take into account all potential confounding interactions 
 this study was designed as a cross - sectional research that restricts any causal inferences and going beyond associations . 
 there are other aspects of sexual dimorphism in pd that need to be addressed in future research , namely , course of progression and mortality . 
 there is a potential risk for selection bias since all recruited patients were from an outpatient neurology clinic where the majority of patients had mild - to - moderate ipd . as a result 
 , our findings may not be generalized to all people with pd , particularly those with end - stage disease . 
 considering time restriction for data collection spent in each participant , we ought to rely on the items from updrs for some variables , which might not be sensitive enough to show between - group differences on this summary scale . therefore 
 , more sensitive gold - standard tools might potentially show different results for such features . 
 our rather small sample size in comparison with few large previous studies should also be noted . 
 augustine et al24 reported that studies with smaller sample sizes were more likely to report sex differences in different clinical features . 
 we should also add the uneven number of males and females in our study as another limitation ; however , it could be expected for pd that affects men more frequently.51 yet the comprehensive list of variables and appropriate multivariate statistical methods of the present study overcame these issues and strengthened our findings . 
 this study provides a comprehensive understanding of sexual dimorphism in different motor and nonmotor features of pd and various domains of daily life by using sophisticated statistical analysis to evaluate the independent differences between males and females . after controlling for potential confounders , anxiety , depression , mobility , emotional well - being , social support , 
 on the other hand , male pd patients had better nutritional status ( though with rather small effect size for difference ) and adl but also more severe orthostasis . conclusively 
 concordance of depression , anxiety and overall psychosocial burden in being more severe in women is in favor of the presence of a considerable sex dimorphism in neuropsychiatric symptoms , which in turn suggest its clinical importance . 
 qol and psychosocial consequences of pd between males and females should be addressed for developing a more personalized caring approach . 
 these aspects of sexual dimorphism in pd also enlighten the features that are more likely to be affected in each sex and should be specifically targeted when managing male and female individuals with pd . as for clinical implication 
 , clinicians should consider sex differences in the evaluation and management of patients with pd . 
 for example , they should be aware of the higher risk of psychological manifestations in women and therefore should screen them accurately in a timely manner and , if necessary , refer them to a psychologist in the early stages of these manifestations . 
 sex - specific symptoms highlight the importance of sex - specific treatments ; hence , future studies should investigate the effects of specific interventions for females . 
 moreover , educational interventions are also needed in order to improve social support for women with pd and reduce their extra psychosocial burden .","visualized findings opls da method three different plots following parameters score scatter plot show performance entire opls da model separate males females refers score participant main discriminant component x block horizontal axis shows score participant orthogonal component vertical axisloadings bars one dimensional plot representing loading value p feature discriminate males females based main discriminant component opls da modelloadings scatter plot plot p refers loading values feature main discriminant component discriminate males females horizontal axis p represents loadings variable orthogonal component differences features related sex vertical axis

"the data presented are based on the retrieval of relevant medical literature by searching pubmed with the terms  deferasirox ( dfx )  and  non - transfusion - dependent thalassemia ( ntdt )  for studies published between 2000 and 2015 . 
 the cochrane database for systematic reviews and clinical trial registries was also searched , and pertinent reviews were identified ( searches last updated august 1 , 2015 ) . 
 thalassemia is a complex entity related to a group of inherited diseases , caused by defective or absent hemoglobin chain synthesis leading to anemia . in general 
 , the severity of the disease depends on the genotype inherited without a definite genotype 
 phenotype correlation due to the presence of several genetic , along with environmental factors , which can alter clinical expression jointly to secondary and tertiary genetic modifiers.1 however , patients with ntdt do not require regular rbc transfusions for survival , but may require occasional transfusions owing to infection or pregnancy or may require more regular transfusions later in life due to splenomegaly or other complications.2 therefore , ntdt encompasses a great variety of syndromes mixed in terms of their molecular background , clinical course , and severity , with the sole common characteristic of independence from regular transfusions.3 currently , beta - thalassemia intermedia , alpha - thalassemia ( mainly hbh disease ) , and mild / moderate forms of hbe / beta - thalassemia are the most prevalent forms in the world.4 despite the lack of a stable transfusional iron overload , the majority of patients with ntdt accumulate iron . 
 ineffective and expanded erythropoiesis are both responsible for the activation of known and unknown signals of epcidin suppression and of a consequent increased intestinal absorption of iron.5 thus , patients with ntdt progressively increase their iron stores which may become clinically significant in the second decade of life and is responsible , along with chronic anemia and hemolysis , for most complications observed in older untreated patients.6 however , it is conceivable that , particularly in the more severe forms , some complications could be ascribed to transfusion therapy ( either intermittent or regular ) as observed for the increased risk of endocrinopathy.7 patients with ntdt accumulate iron chiefly in the liver and scantly in the heart , which may explain the tendency to not develop myocardial siderosis as compared to patients with thalassemia major ( tm).8,9 however , the liver iron overload shown in patients with ntdt has been found to be similar to that of patients with beta tm.10 the elevated iron burden , despite occurring with differences in iron metabolism , pathophysiology and loading rate , is directly involved in the development of several complications or may add in some way to their severity.11 in fact , evaluating a series of unchelated patients by r2 and r2 * magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , a liver iron concentration ( lic ) of 5 or more mg / g dry weight ( dw ) was found to be the cut - off able to accurately discriminate between patients with and without morbidities.12 recently , patients with ntdt were also found to have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and those affected showed a lic of 8.5 mg / g dw ( median : 8.5 ; interquartile range : 4.517.8).13 
 obviously , chelation practice has been routinely performed in the management of iron overload in patients with ntdt , as their anemia contraindicates phlebotomy , but for a long time only as good clinical practice and without both the use of guidelines and the evidence of clinical benefit as observed in their tm counterparts . 
 the optimal care study was the first retrospective study highlighting a protective effect of iron chelation therapy against several complications of ntdt such as pulmonary hypertension and endocrinopathies and thus reinforced the indication to accurately chelate this category of patients.7 on the other hand , it was demonstrated that an increase in serum ferritin level over time was associated with worsening of hepatic fibrosis in patients with ntdt who are not receiving iron chelation treatment.14 the evidence of these studies suggested to scrupulously estimate iron loading particularly at liver level to control and prevent such iron burden with effective iron chelation therapy . 
 guidelines on ntdt chelation treatment have been recently established and recommend initiation of chelation therapy in patients with either ferritin levels higher than 800 ng / l or lic above 5 mg / g dw.15 however , measurement of ferritin may underestimate the level of iron and sometimes among the main ntdt subtypes an irregular correlation exists between ferritin level and lic , as measured by r2 mri or superconducting quantum imaging device.16,17 therefore , a decision - making algorithm has also been created to aid monitoring of iron burden and initiation of chelation therapy.18 until 2005 , the two drugs were available to treat iron overload in a variety of hematologic disorders : deferox - amine ( dfo ) , administered mainly using continuous slow subcutaneous infusion , and the oral iron chelator deferiprone ( dfp).19,20 the dfo , a hexadentate chelator binding iron at a 1:1 molar ratio , was introduced in clinical practice over 40 years ago to decrease iron overload.21 however , the need for frequent and prolonged subcutaneous administration has been associated with undesirable adverse effects and noncompliance to treatment resulting in elevated risk of iron - induced complications.22,23 the oral three times a day agent dfp , a bidentate hydroxypyridone with a small molecular weight , was first used and approved in europe in 1999 for the treatment of iron overload in tm when dfo was contraindicated or inadequate . us 
 food and drug administration approval for clinical use of dfp was delayed until october 2011 because of the lack of traditional safety and efficacy trials comparing dfp and dfo . 
 while dfo and dfp alone and in combination have been widely used in several trials involving patients with tm and proved to be effective in the reduction of iron burden,2427 the scientific evidence of their efficacy in the setting of ntdt is very incomplete and limited to specific subpopulations.28 recently , calvaruso et al described the first 5-year long - term randomized clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of dfp vs dfo in patients with thalassemia intermedia ( ti ) showing that long - term iron chelation therapy with dfp is similarly effective as dfo . 
 however , the use of dfp was accompanied by the occurrence of rare but serious adverse events during treatment , such as neutropenia and agranulocytosis.29 the once daily oral iron chelator , dfx ( exjade , novartis pharmaceuticals corporation , basel , switzerland ) , was introduced later , but has rapidly shown to be effective for reduction of body iron in iron - overloaded patients with transfusion - dependent anemias . 
 it is a tridentate chelator that mobilizes iron stores by binding selectively to the ferric ( fe ) form of iron.30,31 the efficacy of dfx has also been demonstrated in sickle - cell disease and in bone marrow failure syndromes , such as myelodysplastic and aplastic syndromes , diamond  blackfan and fanconi anemia.3234 in a phase i / ii trial with 49 patients with hf - related hereditary hemochromatosis , dfx also proved to be effective in reducing iron overload.35 in the past few years , several clinical trials have shown that accurate monitoring and dose adjustment of dfx was safe and effective in the long - term management of iron - overloaded patients with tm . briefly 
 , it has been assessed that dfx at a dose of 20 mg / kg per day can stabilize serum ferritin levels and lic , while at doses of 3040 mg / kg per day is able to reduce these parameters and achieve negative iron balance in patients with transfusional iron overload.36 
 pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of dfx have been mainly assessed among patients with tm and have been extensively reviewed elsewhere.37,38 however , studies from the myelodysplasia population seem to indicate that dfx has a constant pharmacological profile , independently from the underlying disease or race.39 the dfx is currently the only chelator to have gained approval for the treatment of iron overload in patients with ntdt in the usa ( patients 10 years of age with an lic 5 mg fe / g dw and sf > 300 ng / ml ) and in europe ( lic 5 mg fe / g dw and sf > 800 ng / ml with inadequate response or contraindication to dfo).40 to date three small studies and one large randomized trial have evaluated the safety and efficacy of dfx in patients with ntdt with iron overload ( table 1 ) . in the prospective open label study by voskaridou 
 et al 11 patients received dfx at a starting dose of 1020 mg / kg per day , according to the baseline iron burden , with subsequent dose adjustments according to efficacy and adverse events . after 1 year of treatment , significant improvement of mean liver t2 * ( p=0.02 ) was observed in the eight patients who completed the study.41 in the study by ladis et al,42 eleven patients were enrolled to receive dfx at 10 or 20 mg / kg per day for 24 months . 
 mean lic , measured by mri - t2 * , and mean serum ferritin were significantly reduced ( p=0.005 and p<0.05 , respectively ) in the nine patients completing the study both at 12 and 24 months and five patients achieved lic <3 mg fe / g dw . in both studies , cardiac t2 * and left ventricular ejection fraction remained normal in all patients.41,42 thalassa , a randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled phase ii trial , is the largest study to investigate the safety and efficacy of dfx in reducing iron overload in patients with ntdt.43 the trial included 166 patients with -thalassemia intermedia ( n=95 ) , -thalassemia ( n=22 ) and hbe/-thalassemia ( n=49 ) , and was conducted over 1 year . 
 iron - overloaded patients ( 10 years of age with lic 5 mg fe / g dw and serum ferritin > 300 ng / ml ) were randomized to dfx starting doses of 5 or 10 mg / kg per day or matching placebo . 
 after 1 year of treatment with dfx mean lic decreased significantly from baseline in both starting dose groups ( dfx 5 mg / kg per day : 2.330.70 mg fe / g dw ; p=0.001 and 10 mg / kg per day : 4.180.69 mg fe / g dw ; p<0.001 ) compared to placebo . 
 the decrease in lic , measured by r2-mri , was more significant ( p=0.009 ) for the dfx 10 mg / kg per day group compared with the lower dose group ( 1.850.70 mg fe / g dw ) . 
 similarly , serum ferritin decreased significantly with dfx from baseline to week 52 compared to placebo ( least squares mean 121 ng / ml in 5 mg / kg per day group , 222 ng / ml in 10 mg / kg per day group , + 115 ng / ml for placebo ; p<0.001 ) . 
 patients who completed the thalassa core study were eligible to enter the 1-year extension phase , where patients were continued on dfx or were switched from placebo.44 verall , 133 patients entered the extension phase , including 48 who crossed over from placebo . 
 patients randomized to receive dfx in both phases ( n=110 ) achieved a mean absolute reduction of lic of 7.14 mg fe / g dw from baseline and a mean decrease of serum ferritin of 450 ng / ml . 
 patients who switched over from placebo achieved a mean absolute reduction of 6.66 mg fe / g dw from baseline . at the end of the extension phase 
 the proportion of patients achieving an lic of < 5 mg fe / g was 38.6% overall ( 39.1% randomized to dfx in the core study ; 37.5% originally randomized to placebo ) . 
 a subanalysis was performed evaluating lic reduction in various subgroups , based on baseline lic , baseline serum ferritin , age , sex , race , splenectomy status , and underlying ntdt syndrome.45 across all subgroups , patients receiving dfx showed a greater reduction in lic compared with patients who received placebo with better results in patients in the 10 mg / kg per day starting dose group . 
 the most frequently reported adverse events were mild to moderate in severity . in the thalassa 
 study adverse events assessed to be drug related by the investigators were reported in 24.1% of the patients and were mostly gastrointestinal disorders ( mostly nausea and diarrhea ) , which resolved spontaneously or with dose adjustment or drug interruption . 
 as for renal function , no progressive increases in serum creatinine were observed . in patients 
 treated for 2 years , five experienced two consecutive increases > 33% above baseline and above upper limit of normal.43,44 no similar reports by voskaridou et al41 and ladis et al,42 although in the latter at the end of the 2nd year of treatment serum creatinine increased and creatinine clearance decreased compared to baseline , but neither reached abnormal values . 
 in all three studies mean alt levels decreased over time , suggesting a corresponding improvement in liver function . 
 only one patient in the thalassa extension study experienced hepatitis , which was suspected to be drug related.42 in general efficacy was achieved at relatively lower doses compared to patients with transfusional iron overload . 
 however , monitoring for efficacy and adverse events with adequate dose adjustments remains pivotal in all patients . 
 the most recent study was a multicenter trial performed in iran by karimi et al who treated 50 -thalassemia inter - media patients with serum ferritin > 1,000 ng / ml with dfx for 12 months , observing a significant decrease of ferritin starting at 4 months of treatment.46 
 the recent definition of serum ferritin thresholds to predict clinically relevant lics together with more and more wide access to mri technology have led to the frequent diagnosis of iron overload in patients with ntdt , where initiation of chelation therapy is indicated . as a consequence , to control iron imbalance and to prevent iron toxicity , 
 the long term use of a safe and effective chelator is required . an extensive experience gained from studies in patients with tm with over 150,000 patient years of drug exposure 
 has definitively shown that dfx has a favorable side - effect profile in patients with transfusion - dependent thalassemia ( tdt ) , with treatment - related adverse events comprising gastrointestinal , renal and dermatologic effects that were generally mild and reversible on cessation of treatment.47 in this review the restricted experience from the results on 238 patients with ntdt under continuous dfx treatment were evaluated . 
 these studies involve small numbers of patients followed for 13 years who generally had never been transfused and encompasses two pilot studies , a prospective , placebo - randomized trial with its 2-year extension study and a retrospective study.4146 overall , dfx , at doses ranging from 10 to 20 mg and in a dose - dependent manner , was effective in reducing lic and/or ferritin in patients with different subgroups of ntdt . similarly to tdt , drug - related adverse events reported during these studies , were manageable , self - resolving , and typically did not necessitate discontinuing therapy , even as patients achieved low lic levels toward the end of the study.48 following monthly monitoring , incidences of liver and renal abnormalities were low and nonprogressive . 
 mild , nonprogressive increases in serum creatinine levels were also observed in a few patients ; these increases were generally within the normal range and rarely exceeded twice the upper limit of normal . 
 taken together , these data suggest that the use of dfx can successfully manage iron overload in patients with ntdt . 
 however , further data and larger study populations are needed to explore the safety profile of this drug in this group of patients ( table 2 ) . 
 post - marketing surveillance studies and information from the ongoing thetis trial will provide additional assessment of the long - term efficacy and safety of dfx.49 given the need for lower doses as compared to tm , less toxicity and less morbidity are expected in ntdt than that observed when dfx was initially administered in patients with tm . 
 obviously , in most ntdt forms , lifelong treatment with iron chelation may not be necessary and several attempts at improving drug efficacy and reducing drug toxicity have been given particular attention , as the need to interrupt chelation if treatment goals are reached . 
 in fact , a prudent and conservative approach has been adopted in the thalassa trial in the sense that lic <3 mg fe / g dw was used as an indicator to interrupt iron chelation therapy in the hypothesis that it could represent a low , acceptable iron burden.43 in the described post hoc analysis , a consistent safety profile was nevertheless demonstrated as patients approached this target , indicating that such low iron burdens may be obtained with minimal risk of overchelation.48 this approach , now included in current guidelines for chelation therapy in ntdt , obviously will guarantee from the observed risk in tdt that overchelation could further reduce glomerular filtration rate also in ntdt.50 however , it should be taken into account that cases of glomerular hyperfiltration may be observed in patients with ntdt and that the administration of dfx could bring the glomerular filtration rate levels under control.51 thus , it could be argued that occasionally a potential adverse event may become a useful strategy against the potential damage of persistent glomerular hyperfiltration . 
 while a severe or > 5 mg fe / g dw lic was clearly associated with complications , the level of  acceptable  iron burden and iron associated toxicity in ntdt may be different and transiently modifiable by occasional transfusional requirement . 
 currently , in line with the thalassemia international federation guidelines for dfx use in patients with ntdt , iron chelation should be stopped in patients reaching lic of 3 mg fe / g dw or sf of 300 ng / ml , when mri is unavailable , as safety data do not exist to support continued chelation with dfx below this level.15 on the other hand , due to the permanent progressive iron accumulation , therapy should be restarted when patients re - achieve a lic of 5 mg fe / g dw thus realizing a gray zone ( from 3 to 5 mg fe / g dw ) , where patients are either interrupting treatment or waiting to restart it . 
 it has also been observed that each genetic entity of ntdt has different erythroid activity , hepcidin levels and occasional transfusional iron loading , which may generate in some cases and in the presence of nearly normal lic level , high levels of saturation of transferrin which in turn produces labile iron species and potential organ damage.52,53 given that dfx has been shown not only to control iron burden but also labile plasma iron , the chelatable form of non - transferrin - bound iron , there could be the space to test dfx for a maintenance and or a transient therapy in such circumstances.54 as dfx remains within the therapeutic range over a 24-hour period , it offers a complete chelation coverage at standard doses and can therefore better control labile plasma iron.55 further studies are needed to fully evaluate the efficacy and the safety of alternative administration schedules ( ie , alternate days , three times / week ) and/or reduced doses of dfx to control iron stores in this gray zone , where a maintenance chelation therapy could be acceptable . 
 further studies are also needed to better delineate the appropriate schedule of treatment of dfx to induce a neutral iron balance according to the increased risk of renal injury when a considered safe or normal iron burden has been reached . on the other hand , consideration should be given in the future also to better tailor initial dfx therapy to the basal iron depot , to different subtypes of ntdt , to splenectomy status and to the rate of occasional transfusional iron intake , all conditions which may affect iron balance in ntdt . 
 of particular interest , over the long - term use of dfx , will be also the prospective determination of the impact of iron chelation on most common complications and survival in patients with ntdt . 
 the thetis trial will focus on the effects of 5-year treatment with dfx on the endocrine profile . 
 the favorable outcome of dfx on osteopenia and osteoporosis observed in patients with tm could be expected also in ntdt.56 similarly , the reported long - term effects of dfx treatment on liver fibrosis should be also readdressed in ntdt.57 currently , to improve anemia and reduce the occasional transfusional requirements , patients with ntdt are frequently treated with  older  drugs such hydroxycarbamide58 and new agents such as those interfering with the activity of several transforming growth factor- family cytokines involved in late stages of erythropoiesis59,60 and jak2 inhibitors.61 thus , the efficacy , safety , and pharmacokinetics of dfx should also be evaluated in patients concomitantly receiving some of these drugs , taking into account that the potential interference of such drugs with mechanisms regulating the iron absorption , could further address and limit iron overload . in conclusion , following the results of the thalassa and extension studies , dfx has become the current gold - standard for iron chelation in patients with ntdt . 
 however , prospective data from a randomized comparison with other chelating agents and from a magnitude of drug - exposure comparable to that obtained for patients with tm should be performed to obtain a more accurate and complete evaluation of its profile in patients with ntdt .","ineffective expanded erythropoiesis responsible activation known unknown signals epcidin suppression consequent increased intestinal absorption iron thus patients ntdt progressively increase iron stores may become clinically significant second decade life responsible along chronic anemia hemolysis complications observed older untreated patients however conceivable particularly severe forms complications could ascribed transfusion therapy either intermittent regular observed increased risk endocrinopathy patients ntdt accumulate iron chiefly liver scantly heart may explain tendency develop myocardial siderosis compared patients thalassemia major tm however liver iron overload shown patients ntdt found similar patients beta tm elevated iron burden despite occurring differences iron metabolism pathophysiology loading rate directly involved development several complications may add way severity fact evaluating series unchelated patients r r magnetic resonance imaging mri liver iron concentration lic mg g dry weight dw found cut able accurately discriminate patients without morbidities recently patients ntdt also found increased risk hepatocellular carcinoma affected showed lic mg g dw median interquartile range obviously chelation practice routinely performed management iron overload patients ntdt anemia contraindicates phlebotomy long time good clinical practice without use guidelines evidence clinical benefit observed tm counterparts

"hormones , paracrines , autocrines and other mediators define the permeability of the endothelial barrier , the anti - thrombotic nature of the endothelial cell surface and endothelium - dependent blood pressure regulation ( reviewed in current special issue ; and in libby 2002 ; luscher 1990 ; landmesser and drexler 2007 ; vierhapper et al . 1990 ; wojciak - stothard and ridley 2002 ; palmer et al . 
 endothelial mechanobiology is a young field of research and little is known about mechanics - dependent signaling pathways . 
 this is mainly due to the lack of proper techniques to quantify mechanics in living cells . over the last decade , 
 however , considerable progress has been made in various techniques , such as atomic force microscopy , laser tweezers , optical trap , pipette aspiration and microrheology . 
 experimental science is now equipped with a full tool kit facilitating the investigation of cellular mechanics and its physiological relevance ( lee and lim 2007 ; van vliet et al . 
 . this review will highlight recent advances in the field of endothelial nanomechanics and its impact in endothelial physiology . 
 mechanobiology of the vascular system can be separated into cell mechanics and mechanical stimuli . on the one hand , external forces like fluid shear stress ( fss ) , vessel wall tension , 
 vascular hydrostatic pressure and cell  cell contacts determine the mechanical stimuli in the cardiovascular system . 
 these stresses affect endothelial function via mechanotransduction , i.e. , activation of mechanosensitive pathways ( tzima 2006 ; ando and yamamoto 2009 ; shyu 2009 ; johnson et al . 
 the corresponding mechanosensors exhibit various elements , including mechanosensitive ion channels , adhesion proteins , tyrosine kinase receptors , or caveolae ( liu et al . 2013 ) . 
 cell mechanics , on the other hand , describes the dynamics of cell ( and tissue ) elasticity , measured as mechanical stiffness and its impact on endothelial physiology . in more detail , 
 the four most prominent and mechanically distinct compartments in the endothelium are ( 1 ) the glycocalyx , ( 2 ) the cell cortex , ( 3 ) the cytoplasm and ( 4 ) the nucleus ( kasas et al . 2005 ; dahl et al . 2008 ; oberleithner et al . 2009 , 2011 ; martins et al . 2012 ; weinbaum et al . 2007 ) . 
 recently , nanomechanics has come into the focus of research as it turned out that the stiffness of the single cellular compartments has a crucial impact on endothelial cell function . 
 to understand the exact meaning of cell mechanics and its impact upon physiological mechanisms , it is important to define the molecular basis of the nanomechanical properties and to characterize their influence on cellular signaling processes . 
 the endothelial glycocalyx ( egc ) is a thick carbohydrate - rich layer , lining the luminal side of the endothelial surface that consists of proteoglycans and glycoproteins . 
 the proteoglycans are decorated with long carbohydrate side chains , the glycosaminoglycans , among which heparan sulfate is the most prominent in the egc . 
 this mesh serves as a host for specific plasma proteins , soluble proteoglycans and hyaluronic acid . 
 together , they form a dynamic and complex interface between blood and tissue ( fig .  1 ) . 
 the total volume of the egc in the human body is about 1.7  l and its thickness varies from a few hundreds of nanometers in capillaries to a few micrometers in arteries ( van den berg et al . 
 2006 , 2008 ) . due to its high water content and the loose network , 
 the egc is several times softer than the underlying subcellular structures ( oberleithner et al . 
 glycocalyx and cytoskeletal organization of endothelial cells determine the mechanical characteristics of the endothelium cellular nanomechanics . 
 glycocalyx and cytoskeletal organization of endothelial cells determine the mechanical characteristics of the endothelium one hallmark function of the egc is the transmission of biochemical and biomechanical signals from the blood into endothelial cells . 
 different processes are known that alter the nanomechanical properties of the egc . as a polyanionic bio - gel , 
 its volume and mechanics are regulated by the respective electrolyte concentration ( wolf and gingell 1983 ; peters et al . 
 it has been shown that an extracellular sodium concentration in the upper physiological range leads to a compact egc ( = collapse ; oberleithner et al . 
 in contrast , treatment of endothelial cells with the polyphenol - rich compound ws1442 induces an increase in volume ( = swelling ) of the egc ( peters et al . 
 . the specific mechanisms of collapse and swelling depend on dominant interactions in the system ( hydrogen bondings , ionic interactions , hydrophobic / hydrophilic properties , etc . ) 
 ( quesada - perez et al . 2011 ) . other processes , which modulate the nanomechanics of the egc , are shedding and biosynthesis . 
 both can be induced by biochemical factors like hormones and enzymes ( reitsma et al . 
 2007 ) or by fss ( gouverneur et al . 2006 ; zeng and tarbell 2014 ) . 
 enzymatic digestion of heparan sulfate as well as treatment of endothelial cells with thrombin , lipopolysaccharides , or tumor necrosis factor  compromises the structural integrity of the egc leading to reduced egc volume and stiffness ( peters et al . 
 in contrast , the biosynthesis of the egc after enzymatic degradation leads to an increase in volume and a decrease in stiffness , as has been shown in vitro ( bai and wang 2012 ) . 
 the egc is the very first layer of the endothelium that comes into contact with blood . 
 thus , alterations of egc nanomechanics lead to a change in the mechanical interaction between blood cells and the egc constituents . 
 it is likely that a collapsed egc can be less deformed by fss and thereby becomes unable to transmit signals into the cell adequately , a condition that can promote cardiovascular disease . 
 additional to their function as fss transmitters , the proteoglycan - associated heparin sulfate residues serve as attachment points for sodium ions and substances like albumin and other blood - borne proteins , hormones and enzymes ( siegel et al . 
 1996 ; reitsma et al . 2007 ; quinsey et al . 2004 ; kato 2002 ; li et al . 1998 ; ballinger et al . 2004 
 for instance , increased plasma sodium concentration leads to a stiffening of the glycocalyx and simultaneously increases cellular sodium uptake ( korte et al . 
 2a ) is supposed to stand for a fully - functional endothelium , whereas a shedded or collapsed egc most likely exerts adverse effects on the vascular system . 
 2b ) , facilitates edema formation ( salmon and satchell 2012 ; strunden et al . 
 2010 ) , cell vessel wall interactions ( constantinescu et al . 2003 ; henry and duling 2000 ; mulivor and lipowsky 2004 ) , loss of fss perception ( thi et al . 2004 ; mochizuki et al . 
 2003 ) and endothelial dysfunction ( nieuwdorp et al . 2005 , 2006 ; drake - holland and noble 2012 ) . 
 2c ) has been discussed as being a promoter of vascular diseases ( peters et al .

 c acute collapse leads to similar functional changes as described in b but egc nanomechanics are different 
 crossing the cell membrane , the first significant mechanical compartment inside the cell is , directly underneath the plasma membrane , the cell cortex . 
 due to the three - dimensional cytoskeletal organization , the cell cortex as well as the cytoplasm and the nucleus , can be characterized by their distinct cytoskeleton - dependent nanomechanical properties ( oberleithner et al . 
 2009 ; kasas et al . 2005 ; dahl et al . 2008 ; martins et al . 2012 ) . directly beneath the plasma membrane ( 50200  nm ) , actin 
 is organized in form of a dynamic network ( fig .  1 ) ( miranda et al . 1974 ; koning et al . 2008 ) . the cortical web , also known as peripheral actin , is made of cross - linked actin filaments ( f - actin ) that provide a supportive structure to the plasma membrane and its embedded proteins ( pollard and cooper 2009 ) . 
 the organization of the cortical cytoskeleton is highly dynamic as the actin filaments are regulated by a variety of actin binding proteins ( dos remedios et al . 
 additionally , actin polymerization is stimulated by cdc42 and rac1 , both members of the rho gtpase family . 
 cortactin and other proteins , such as filamin or fascin , stabilize the actin web by cross - linking filaments . 
 destabilization of the cortical actin network due to filament disassembly is induced by cofilin , gelsolin , or rhoa . 
 finally , motor proteins are able to cross - link actin filaments and simultaneously facilitate the force administration to the cortical web ( dos remedios et al . 
 . a high rate of actin polymerization and a dense filament organization go along with a relatively stiff cortex , whereas a depolymerization of f - actin results in cortical softening ( kasas et al . 2005 ) . 
 filamin a and/or -actinin cross - link actin filaments and subsequently lead to an increased stiffness of the actin web ( esue et al . 2009 ; kasza et al . 
 furthermore , motor proteins ( e.g. , non - muscle myosin ii ) contribute to cortical stiffness as they generate contractile forces within the filament network . by this 
 , motor proteins induce a lateral tension within the cortical network leading to an inward directed tension ( paluch et al . 
 there is evidence that nanomechanics of the cell cortex has significant influence on endothelial physiology ( hoffman and crocker 2009 ; paluch et al . 
 in particular , nitric oxide ( no ) release and barrier function , both hallmarks of endothelial function , appear to be influenced by cortical nanomechanics . 
 in the vascular endothelium , a softening of the cell cortex induces no synthesis and thereby is likely to facilitate vasodilation followed by an increase in tissue perfusion and decrease of blood pressure ( oberleithner et al . 
 2007 , 2009 ; szczygiel et al . 2011 ) . under certain physiological conditions , 
 plasma potassium concentration can increase locally up to 12  mm , e.g. , due to muscle or neuronal activity ( nordsborg et al . 2003 ; kofuji and newman 2004 ) , which induces a rapid decrease in cortical stiffness ( oberleithner et al . 2009 ) . 
 this softening of the cell cortex is driven by a membrane potential - dependent depolymerization of the submembranous actin web ( callies et al . 
 a decrease in cortical stiffness is generally caused by a destabilization of the cortical actin web , which verifies the physiological link of elasticity , actin organization and endothelial function ( fels et al . 2012 ) . 
 simultaneously , the activity of the endothelial no synthase ( enos ) increases ( fig . 
 firstly , it has been shown that enos activity is stimulated by an association with g - actin while it is inhibited by an association with f - actin ( kondrikov et al . 
 a decrease in cortical stiffness due to f - actin depolymerization may increase the association of enos with g - actin and therefore directly stimulates no release ( fels et al . 
 mechanosensitive calcium channels in a  flexible  membrane are supposed to be readily activated by shear stress and subsequently increase intracellular calcium levels ( knudsen and frangos 1997 ; kuchan and frangos 1994 ; galan et al . 2011 ) . as enos 
 is activated by the calcium - binding protein calmodulin , a soft cortex is likely to promote no release . since no is a vasodilating gas , softening - induced enos activity will lead to increased tissue perfusion 
 furthermore , blood pressure may decrease in case of systemic softening of the endothelial cortex.fig . 
 softening of the cell cortex , induced by cortical actin depolymerization , decreases membrane abundance of enac and endothelial sodium uptake and increases enos activity and increases endothelial barrier function cortical stiffness influences endothelial function . 
 softening of the cell cortex , induced by cortical actin depolymerization , decreases membrane abundance of enac and endothelial sodium uptake and increases enos activity and increases endothelial barrier function interestingly , these modulations of cortical stiffness and enos activity are independent of the bulk nanomechanics of the endothelial cells ( oberleithner et al . 2009 ; fels et al . 2012 ) . 
 while , under physiological conditions , potassium concentrations may rise to a larger extent only locally , other mediators potentially act more systemically , i.e. , on the whole vasculature . 
 the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone , as well as the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( tnf ) , induce transient cortical softening associated with an increase in no release ( fels et al . 
 interestingly , sustained exposure to aldosterone or tnf results in an opposite effect , described in detail in the subsequent section . 
 in addition to the regulation of enos activity , other vascular mechanisms such as endothelial permeability are influenced by cortical nanomechanics . 
 since the link between no synthesis and cortical stiffness is the dynamic reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton , it was hypothesized that the stiffness - dependent barrier function is again based on cortical actin dynamics . 
 this hypothesis is verified by the finding that exposure to sphingosine-1-phosphate increases peripheral ( cortical ) stiffness in pulmonary endothelial cells and thereby increases barrier function . 
 the barrier - enhancing effect is most likely mediated via a signaling cascade including cortactin activation and subsequent actin filament formation in the cell cortex ( arce et al . 
 in contrast , thrombin acts as the counterpart in regulation of endothelial permeability as it decreases cortactin in the cortex and at the same time increases permeability ( arce et al . 
 stimulation of myosin activity , as a second important determinant of cortical stiffness , leads to an increase in barrier function ( dudek et al . 
 hence , it may be concluded that a soft cell cortex indicates a physiological function of the endothelium . in analogy to cortical 
 softening , increased polymerization of cortical actin and concomitant stiffening of the endothelial cell cortex has ( patho-)physiological consequences in the control of endothelial permeability and the response to hormone action ( hall 1984 ; birukova et al . 
 endothelial stiffening by the c - reactive protein and the cathelicidin ll-37 peptide is found to have anti - inflammatory effects , possibly due to a decrease in endothelial permeability ( kusche - vihrog et al . 2011 ; byfield et al . 
 these effects contribute to maintaining tissue fluid homeostasis and hence counteract the increased no production and subsequent drop in blood pressure often accompanying acute inflammatory processes and septic shock . 
 3b ) , as a cell with a stiff cortex produces reduced amounts of no ( oberleithner et al . 
 2007 , 2009 ; kidoaki and matsuda 2007 ; fels et al . 2010 ) . 
 the phenomenon  increased endothelial cortical stiffness / reduced no release  was recently termed  stiff endothelial cell syndrome ( secs )  ( lang 2011 ) . 
 diminished no release and thus a shift of endothelial action towards increased vasoconstriction , is also the hallmark of endothelial dysfunction , a clinical predictor for expecting cardiovascular diseases later in life ( endemann and schiffrin 2004 ; schachinger et al . 
 one of the crucial prerequisites leading to an increase in endothelial stiffness and a reduced no production is a rather high plasma aldosterone level , a major risk factor for vasculopathies . 
 upon prolonged treatment ( > 20  min ) with aldosterone , endothelial cells swell ( oberleithner et al . 
 both of these effects are blocked either by the specific epithelial sodium channel ( enac ) blocker amiloride or by the aldosterone antagonist spironolactone . 
 both prevent a ( further ) augmentation in endothelial stiffness upon raising extracellular sodium concentrations from 135 to 145  mm in the presence of aldosterone ( oberleithner et al . 
 incidentally , these two factors , aldosterone and high sodium , also cause an increase in enac surface expression ( kusche - vihrog et al . 2008 ; korte et al . 2012 ) , indicating a key role of aldosterone in controlling enac activity by increasing the channel s abundance at the endothelial cell surface ( alvarez et al . 2002 ; snyder 2002 ) . 
 enac is widely abundant in various tissues throughout the human body , including epithelia tissues where this sodium channel mediates the rate - limiting step of sodium transport ( garty and palmer 1997 ; golestaneh et al . 
 2001 ) . in vascular endothelium , enac is different , as the major portion of sodium exits the blood capillary system through a more or less  leaky  paracellular pathway ( mehta and malik 2006 ) . also , the enac expression level is clearly lower as compared to epithelial tissues ( kusche - vihrog et al . 
 recently , a direct link between enac expression and no release has been established , suggesting the functional role of enac in the vascular endothelium ( jeggle et al . 
 2013 ) . cells with elevated enac expression exhibit an increase in mechanical cortical stiffness in vitro and ex vivo . taken together 
 , enac determines cortical endothelial stiffness and plays a major role in endothelial ( dys)function contributing to the control of vascular tone . 
 the mechanistic basis of the link between enac and endothelial stiffness most likely relies on the direct interaction of enac with f - actin located in the subapical pool underneath the plasma membrane ( mazzochi et al . 
 alterations in cortex formation upon changes in the enac surface expression could thus also be ascribed to this interaction , as it might increase actin polymerization in this compartment and hence increase cortical stiffness . 
 the sequence of events , whether enac membrane insertion promotes actin polymerization or vice versa , has not yet been elucidated . 
 in addition to chemical mediators , mechanical stimuli affect actin organization ( most likely influencing cortical stiffness ) and endothelial function . 
 an in vitro increase in hydrostatic pressure , mimicking blood pressure in vivo , induces actin reorganization and affects endothelial permeability ( shin et al . 
 fluid shear stress influences actin reorganization ( seebach et al . 2007 ) and alters the endothelial barrier ( tarbell 2010 ; katoh et al . 
 finally , substrate stiffness was shown to induce actin polymerization , modulating barrier function in a dose - dependent manner ; substrate stiffness simulating  physiological conditions 
 improves barrier function while stiffer and softer substrates disrupt barrier function ( birukova et al . 
 the elasticity of the cell cortex can be seen as a parameter that determines endothelial physiology in a more general way . 
 for instance , aging cells lose their elasticity due to an increased cytoskeletal organization ( sokolov et al . 2006 ; schulze et al . 
 2010 ) . even basic processes that usually occur in cellular life , such as mitosis , differentiation and development , can be related to changes in cortical stiffness ( stewart et al . 
 2011 ; patel et al . 2012 ; kidoaki and matsuda 2007 ; hoffman and crocker 2009 ) . 
 fountain of youth  and guarantees a reasonably low blood pressure and a healthy organism . 
 apparently , the physiological impact of cortical stiffness on physiological mechanisms is highly tissue - specific . 
 in contrast to the endothelium , a soft cortex can even indicate a pathophysiological state of a cell . in ventricular myocytes , for instance , the relationship between elasticity and no release appears to be different . 
 there , an inhibition of myosin by blebbistatin decreases cell stiffness and simultaneous inhibits nos activity ( walsh and cole 2013 ; dedkova et al . 
 furthermore , it has been shown that the metastatic behavior of cancer cells directly correlates with the cell s elasticity . 
 cancer cells with a low elasticity ( soft cells ) are more likely to spread than stiffer ones ( ketene et al . 
 additionally , breast cancer cells induce softening of the endothelium to ease extravasation , leading to facilitated metastasis formation ( mierke 2011 ) . 
 while single actin filaments are predominantly found in the cortex , actin stress fibers ( bundles of 1030 filaments ) span the whole cytoplasm . 
 they also contribute to focal adhesions and thus are involved in the mechanisms of cell motility ( pellegrin and mellor 2007 ; fletcher and mullins 2010 ; prasain and stevens 2009 ) . 
 microtubules are tube - like polymerized protein ( tubulin ) filaments facilitating the transport of organelles and vesicles . 
 both microtubules and intermediate filaments determine cytoplasmic ( bulk ) stiffness ( wang 1998 ; janmey et al . 1991 ; kasas et al . 2005 ; herrmann et al . 
 the molecular nature of the contribution of tubulin to cell nanomechanics has been investigated in detail ( gardel et al . 
 so far , the microtubule network is supposed to represent a compressive load - bearing component that counteracts the tensile forces generated by the cortical actimyosin web ( ingber 2003 ) . 
 the physiological relevance in stiffness - dependent signaling pathways in endothelial cells is , however , still unclear . 
 what is known so far is that microtubule - associated proteins ( e.g. , map65 ) directly influence the flexibility of single microtubules , most likely resulting in a change in cellular elasticity ( portran et al . 
 furthermore , in the developing organ of corti , the fibroblast growth factor induces a microtubule - dependent decrease in cell stiffness leading to hearing loss ( szarama et al . 
 intermediate filaments , of which vimentin is the dominant network - forming member in the endothelium , support the three - dimensional organization of the cell and its organelles ( kamei 1994 ) . their mechanical properties as well as their contribution to cell mechanics have been reviewed by herrmann et al . 
 intermediate filaments play a key role in mechanotransduction as mutation or deletion of several intermediate filament proteins leads to cell fragility , heart failure and muscle dystrophies . 
 even leucocyte diapedesis and endothelial nitric oxide release depend on proper intermediate filament formation ( herrmann et al . 
 although the role of intermediate filaments in ( endothelial ) physiology is well documented and the molecular contributions to cell mechanics are known , evidence for a direct link between intermediate filament - dependent mechanics and endothelial function is still missing . data on intermediate filament and microtubule mechanics and its impact on endothelial physiology indicate that several different nanomechanical signaling pathways exist that await future investigation . 
 each individual component of the cellular cytoskeleton described in the previous sections is directly linked to the cell nucleus . 
 plectin ( nesprin-3 ) provides a link to the cytoplasmic network of intermediate filaments ( wilhelmsen et al . 
 2005 ) , whereas nesprin-1/2 mediates binding to microtubules and the actin network ( padmakumar et al . 
 nesprins connect cytoskeletal networks with the intranuclear lamin network via sun 1/2 proteins ( haque et al . 
 it is therefore conceivable that all of the mechanical stimuli perceived by the cell through actin , microtubule , or intermediate filament networks are integrated on the level of the nuclear lamina . 
 similar to the cortical mechanics , the nucleus of an eukaryotic cell could also be an important contributor to the overall mechanics of the cell . 
 nuclei of several cell types have been shown to be two- to ten - fold stiffer than the respective cytosol ( martins et al . 
 , the cell nucleus could be envisioned as being a supramolecular shock absorber capable of withstanding considerable stress ( dahl et al . 
 a connection between cytoskeleton and the nuclear envelope further strengthens the notion of a direct involvement of the nucleus in mechanosensing and mechanotransduction ( maniotis et al . 
 recently , the pioneering work from the laboratory of dennis discher demonstrated that the nucleus can serve as an intracellular  mechanostat 
 ( swift et al . 2013 ) , a structure that is able to sense and respond to changes in the mechanical properties of the cellular environment by changing its own stiffness ( fig . 
 elasticity of the cell nucleus regulates gene expression and endothelial function nuclear elasticity in endothelial function . 
 elasticity of the cell nucleus regulates gene expression and endothelial function in the light of recent advances in the field of  nuclear mechanics  , it is tempting to speculate that nuclei of endothelial cells could be directly involved in mediating physiological functions in response to mechanical stimuli . 
 nuclei of endothelial cells are particularly large in comparison to those of other cell types . 
 nuclei bulge into the lumina of blood vessels , thus being directly exposed to the shear strain exerted by the blood flow . 
 consequently , any change in nuclear volume and/or stiffness could have a strong influence on blood flow , in particular in vessels of small inner diameters . according to hagen - poisseulle s law 
 thus , a small change in nuclear volume , as shown and quantified in vascular endothelium in response to aldosterone ( oberleithner et al . 
 bulging nuclei could be a significant hindrance for blood flow , in particular when the nuclei stiffen at the same time . 
 in addition , nuclei of the cells exposed to shear stress stiffen ( fig . 
 apparently , flattening and stiffening of the nuclei could be the consequence of a shape change induced by shear forces . 
 however , the  recovery in shape  and , at the same time , the maintenance of nuclear stiffness upon release of the shear forces , point towards a more complex nuclear remodeling mechanism . the question , whether the expression of the lamin a network at the nucleoplasmic side  a major determinant in the control of the nuclear envelope plasticity ( lammerding et al . 2006)is responsible for the nuclear  mechanostat function , remains open ( swift et al . 
 there is another reason indicating a potential role of lamin a in the regulation of nuclear plasticity . 
 a mutation of lamin a , which results in an irreversible ( permanent ) anchoring of the mutated product in the nuclear envelope , results in a severe clinical manifestation termed hutchison - gilford progeria syndrome ( hgps ) ( merideth et al . 
 affected individuals undergo drastically accelerated aging and die in their teens of cardiovascular - related diseases such as stroke or myocardial infarction ( gerhard - herman et al . 2012 ) . at tissue level , 
 major arteries of hgps patients demonstrate a severe degeneration of the smooth muscle cell layer ( stehbens et al . 
 the role of endothelial cells in the development of the syndrome has not been fully assessed to date . 
 however , at the level of individual cell nuclei , the presence of a mutated rigid lamin a network at the inner side of the nuclear envelope has been linked to significant stiffening of such nuclei ( philip and dahl 2008 ) . 
 it is therefore tempting to speculate that  stiff nuclei  cause an overall stiffening of the endothelial cell . 
 this could result in a severe form of the stiff endothelial cell syndrome ( lang 2011 ) . in this case , the ability of the endothelial cell of sensing and responding to mechanical stimuli might be disrupted . as a result 
 , the downstream signaling directed towards vascular smooth muscle is expected to be impaired , possibly explaining the degradation of vascular smooth muscle cell layer in hgps . in summary , the question , whether nuclear mechanics follows mechanical alterations evoked from the exterior environment as postulated by the  nuclear mechanostat  theory ( swift et al . 
 2013 ) and/or whether any changes in nuclear elasticity could primarily alter endothelial function , will be an exciting area of cell research in the near future . 
 in conclusion , the elastic properties of the four compartments , ( 1 ) glycocalyx , ( 2 ) cortex , ( 3 ) cytoplasm and ( 4 ) nucleus , are mainly determined by the composition of the respective structural elements . 
 the dynamic interactions between those elements with cross - linker and motor proteins determine the mechanical properties of the respective region . 
 nanomechanics provides information on the physiological state of the endothelial cell in terms of nitric oxide release and barrier function . 
 a soft cell cortex , combined with a soft , well - hydrated glycocalyx , increases no formation , which is a prerequisite for a functionally intact vasculature . 
 any changes in elasticity at the level of the egc glycocalyx , the cell cortex and the cell nucleus , can have a significant influence on endothelial function in terms of local blood flow , tissue perfusion and , finally , arterial blood pressure .","dahl et al

 there is accumulating evidence that endothelial nanomechanics of these individual compartments control vascular physiology . depending on protein composition , filament formation and interaction with cross - linker proteins , 
 these four compartments determine endothelial stiffness . 
 structural organization and mechanical properties directly influence physiological processes such as endothelial barrier function , nitric oxide release and gene expression . 
 this review will focus on endothelial nanomechanics and its impact on vascular function ."
"self - esteem is an important state of mind which allows individuals to accept themselves as they are and be self - confident . 
 rosenberg ( 1965 ) considered self - esteem as the positive or negative attitude of an individual toward himself . 
 if an individual has a positive attitude in self - assessment , his self - esteem would be high ; if he has a negative attitude , then his self - esteem would be low . 
 self - esteem is a psychological phenomenon that has a definite effect on the emotional and cognitive dimensions of an individual . 
 the individuals with a high self - esteem tend to perceive themselves worth being respected and approved , important and beneficial . on the other hand , the individuals who have a negative idea about themselves or who have low self - esteem tend to perceive themselves as not very important , lacking lovability , and with no comfort in themselves and their capabilities . 
 high self - esteem is considered important because it is associated with higher levels of psychological health and functioning and low level of self - esteem is undesirable because it is associated with lower levels of psychological health and functioning . 
 one of the major reasons for researchers interest on self - esteem is its effects on health . 
 damaged self - esteem makes it impossible to endure the harsh conditions of everyday life and produces adverse physical and psychological outcomes . 
 therefore , there is always the risk of appearance of mental disease in the postpartum period . 
 the postpartum depression is a disorder of non - psychosis depression according to the study of hendrick et al . as per the american psychiatric association [ diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder - iv ( dsm - iv ) ] , 
 brown et al . reported that about 50% of women are affected by depression at the first 3 months after delivery , whereas one - third of them are affected by depression after 3 months of delivery . 
 although several factors influence depression , the psychosocial factors play a strong role in prediction of this disorder . 
 self - esteem is one of the variables that affects deleteriously on the pregnancy outcomes and postpartum period . 
 's study showed that self - esteem may be a useful predictor of disorders such as anxiety and depression . 
 depression and self - esteem tend to be highly correlated with each other . it has been accepted that depressed people think in a negative manner and report lower self - esteem than non - depressed people . 
 the robustness of the effect also strengthens the potential importance of self - esteem interventions ,  said sowislo . 
 she believes that treatments aimed at reducing depression by way of improving self - esteem could provide not only short - term gains for clients but also long - term protection from depression for those most at risk . 
 it was found that individuals who have effective and positive social problem - solving approach have a high self - esteem . 
 the individuals with high self - esteem generally have more confidence in their initial approaches to the problems and , therefore , they seek less information before offering solutions and making decisions . 
 problem - solving approach is a cognitive behavioral process . by means of problem - solving skills 
 , people can identify and recommend the effective strategies to face stressful situations in everyday life . social problem solving 
 can be viewed as an important conformity mechanism that serves to increase behavioral competence and it leads to decrease in psychological distress . 
 dzurilla suggested that self - esteem may play an important role in the relationship between self - appraised social problem - solving ability and psychological adjustment . 
 also , mccabe et al . found that social problem solving was predicted by self - esteem and depressive symptoms . in aylward 's study , 
 self - esteem emerged as the most important predictor of social problem - solving model . 
 some evidence was found to link the relationship between self - esteem and problem - solving skills . in the study of mahmoudi rad 
 entitled the role of social problem solving and communication skills training on enhancing self - esteem level and its relationship to mental functioning and academic achievement of students ,  it was found that self - esteem scores of the two groups showed significant difference before and after intervention . 
 the researchers stated that the findings suggest a direct effect and positive role of training of communication skills and social problem - solving abilities when a person faces social and personal problems . 
 the study of abuhamzeh entitled  the effect of problem solving training on increasing the self - esteem of students in school  showed that training of problem solving significantly increases overall , academic , social , and family self - esteem in the intervention group than in the control group . 
 this effect remains for up to 2months after the education . in the study of sharifi 
 , it was found that problem - solving training positively affected the self - esteem of students with behavior problems . 
 based on studies , we can conclude that with higher problem - solving skills and social problem solving , we can increase a person 's self - esteem and decrease the depressive symptoms . 
 several studies showed that low self - esteem is associated with increased anxiety and depression . 
 rees conducted an exploratory study of the effectiveness of guided imagery protocol with relaxation on reducing anxiety and depression and increasing self - esteem in primiparas during the first postpartum month . 
 not only relaxation and imagery decrease stress , pain , and anxiety , but also they generate a more positive understanding and a more strong feeling about well - being . with relaxation 
 , the person can attach importance to herself and she can perceive everything that she needs . 
 this develops self - appraised process which is the first important step toward self - esteem . 
 although there is little evidence about the effect of relaxation on self - esteem , its positive effect is somewhat proved . 
 the relaxation training is simple technique and easy to practice at home ; it can increase the self - esteem and decrease psychological problems . 
 relaxation and problem - solving training are behavioural  cognitive interventions that help to decrease depressive symptoms and increase self - esteem ; also , the self - esteem of depressed women is low during postpartum period . 
 hence , a study should be performed for determining the more effective and simpler technique . 
 this study was done with the aim of comparing the effects of problem - solving skills training and relaxation on the self - esteem of women in postpartum period . 
 this was a clinical trial with a control group in 39 weeks in postpartum period and was conducted after getting permission from the ethics committee of mashhad university of medical science . 
 all women on days 1520 after delivery who referred to mashhad health centers from december 2009 to june 2010 participated in the study after completing the consent form . 
 the inclusion criteria were : literate women , 1835 years old , with the term neonate , singleton , healthy infant , the history of lack of chronic medical illness , without history of previous depression , and no smoking . 
 at first , edinburgh postnatal depression scale ( epds ) was completed by the subjects . 
 women whose get score 10 or above , completed beck depression inventory ( bdi ) . 
 those who obtained a score of 1428 and confirmed to be depressed by a clinical interview conducted by a psychologist ( based on dsm - iv criteria ) in the health centers were divided into three groups randomly : problem - solving training ( n = 26 ) , relaxation ( n = 26 ) , and control group ( n = 28 ) [ figure 1 ] . 
 eysenck self - esteem scale which has seven items and a score of 140 was completed by the women at the onset of research . 
 interventions in the two groups of problem solving and relaxation were performed by a researcher ( midwife ) . 
 the researcher had been taught by a clinical psychologist and after gaining the skills , she received a certificate of performance of relaxation and problem solving skills . 
 a pilot study had been done on depressed women in ebne - sina hospital in mashhad before conducting the main study . 
 chart of sampling process intervention was performed in the problem - solving group , which consisted of six sessions weekly in the healthy centers . 
 the researcher notified the appointment by telephone to the research units before the intervention . in the problem - solving group , at the first session which lasted 1 h , the participants were trained in five skills of problem solving ( general orientation , problem definition and formulation , generation of alternatives , decision making , and verification ) . in the next sessions which lasted 4550 min , depressive symptoms of women were studied according to the beck inventory ; different solutions were presented by women and the best solution was selected for performing until the next session . 
 the recording checklist of problem - solving sessions was completed by the researcher in each session . in the relaxation group , 
 the first two sessions of relaxation were performed in the health center , and each session lasted about half an hour ; the other sessions took 1020 min . in the first session of relaxation training , the causes of postpartum depression and the ways of controlling it were discussed and the relaxation purposes were explained . 
 also , women were trained about how to contract and relax their 16 groups of muscles similar to jacobson 's method , and the practice was demonstrated by the researcher 
 . then the practice was repeated once in the presence of a researcher by a training mother . in the second session 
 , progressive muscle relaxation technique was performed once again by a mother in the presence of the researcher and after correction and ensuring the accuracy of the technique , the cd of progressive muscle relaxation was given to the women to perform the exercise daily at home . 
 in the next four sessions , in addition to the exercises of relaxation performed at home , the imagery techniques ( forest visualization , beach , pilgrimage sits , and green space with good climate ) were performed by the researcher . 
 the relaxation exercise was performed by the women at home for about 20 min daily . 
 the form of recording the exercises performed at home was given to women and it was emphasized to bring it along with them in each session . at the beginning of each session , the positive and negative experiences of women were considered and they asked about how they could perform relaxation techniques . 
 the control group recoursed to health center weekly and they bring the recording checklistof postpartum depressive symptoms with themselves and routine care after delivery is performed for them according to the booklet of safe mother . 
 nine weeks after delivery , each of the three groups completed the eysenck self - esteem scale again as a post - test . in this research , 
 the instruments of data collection included the edinburgh depression scale , beck depression inventory - ii , eysenck self - esteem scale , the socio - demographic questionnaire , recorded checklist of depressive symptoms , and recorded checklist of problem - solving sessions . 
 the edinburgh scale is a standard instrument for screening depressive women in the postpartum period . 
 this instrument assesses the feeling of women in the past 7 days and it has 10 items and each item has a score of 03 . 
 it assesses the feeling of women in the past 1 week and its answers are scored between 0 and 3 . 
 eysenck self - esteem scale has 7 items and each item has a score of 020 . 
 the first two sections included 20 questions about personal characteristics , pregnancy , and recent childbirth , which were completed before implementing interventions and its two questions were completed on referring to patients files . 
 the third section included four questions that collected information on the availability of someone to help at home , sleeplessness difficulties , and breastfeeding , and it was completed 9 weeks after delivery . 
 the validity of beck depression test was confirmed by mohammad khani in tehran , and in this study , the alpha coefficient was 0.827 . 
 the data obtained in this study were analyzed using descriptive statistics , analysis of one - way variance , chi - square test , and spearman correlation coefficient by spss software .

 the data obtained in this study were analyzed using descriptive statistics , analysis of one - way variance , chi - square test , and spearman correlation coefficient by spss software . 
 each of the three groups showed no significant statistical differences regarding their age ( p = 0.680 ) , husband support ( p = 1.000 ) , satisfaction in marital life ( question by likert scale ) ( p = 0.506 ) , unwanted pregnancy ( p = 0.392 ) , neonate sex ( p = 0.253 ) , social support ( cassidy social support scale ) ( p = 0.078 ) , self - esteem ( p = 0.145 ) , and the score of edinburgh depression scale ( p = 0.258 ) [ table 1 ] . in this study , 
 53.8% women had high , 42.5% had moderate , and 3.8% had low self - esteem . 
 descriptive characteristics of problem - solving training , relaxation , and control groups before intervention the mean of self - esteem score was 103.7  21.6 before intervention in the problem - solving group that increased to 117.9  9.7 after the intervention . also , in the relaxation group , the mean of self - esteem score was 112.1  16.7 before the intervention , which increased to 117.0  11.8 after the intervention . in the control group , 
 the mean of self - esteem score was 111.8  13.1 in the beginning of the study and it changed to 113.5  10.4 at the end of the study . by means of self - esteem scale , 
 the self - esteem levels in each group were obtained . in our study , the self - esteem of relaxation group was moderate ( 42.3% ) and high ( 57.7% ) before the intervention and reached a moderate level in 23.1% and a high level in 76.9% of the cases after the intervention . 
 results showed relaxation can increase moderate self - esteem to high self - esteem . in the present study , 
 the self - esteem score was low in 11.5% , moderate in 34.6% , and high in 53.8% of the problem - solving group before the intervention , which became moderate in 15.4% and high in 84.6% of the cases after the intervention . in the ninth week after delivery at which the intervention of relaxation and problem - solving training groups was completed , the statistical results of one - way variance analysis showed that the three groups had no significant differences at the end of study ( p = 0.288 ) . but according to the mean difference of self - esteem score before and after the intervention ( by one - way anova test ) , it was found that there was significant difference among the three groups [ table 2 ] . 
 the tukey test showed that the two groups of relaxation and problem solving had significant difference ( p = 0.018 ) . also , the intervention groups had significant difference compared to the control group ( p = 0.000 ) [ table 3 ] . 
 comparison of mean difference of self - esteem scores in three groups before and after intervention comparison of three groups based on tukey test 
 generally , the three groups showed a significant difference regarding the mean difference of self - esteem score . in this study , both the interventions of relaxation and problem solving could increase the self - esteem score , while the control group showed no increase in self - esteem score . 
 these findings indicate that both types of training ( problem solving and relaxation ) can produce a positive change in the overall self - esteem and improve the behavioral problems of women later in the postpartum period . 
 findings and the methods used in the study of ress are similar to those of our study . 
 unfortunately , no other study has been found that examined the effect of relaxation on self - esteem . 
 aylward et al . found that self - esteem is the most important predictor of social problem - solving model and high self - esteem plays a major role in the relationship between problem - solving ability and psychological balance . 
 the study of abuhamzeh showed that training of problem solving significantly increases the overall self - esteem in the intervention group than in the control group . 
 although abuhamzeh worked on healthy students , the method of performing problem - solving skills is similar to our study . 
 also , sharifi showed that problem - solving training could increase the self - esteem in students with behavioral problems . 
 the present study showed similar results , but sharifi performed problem solving in 9 weeks , each session lasting 90 min , and we performed six sessions of 4560 min duration each . 
 in addition , although the type of instrument used to evaluate self - esteem and the sex ( male and female ) and number of individuals were different in this study compared to our study , the results of both studies showed the effectiveness of this type of training in increasing the self - esteem score . 
 we observed that the training of problem - solving skills increases the self - esteem score of depressed women more than relaxation training in the postpartum period . 
 although problem solving had more effect on self - esteem , the relaxation method is simple and easily practiced at home . 
 relaxation is accepted by most people and no need to haunt or many facilities . while in problem - solving method , an average of 214 min per patient visit with a psychiatrist or a general practitioner is required , and thus is time consuming . 
 however , no study is found that compared the effect of relaxation and problem solving on self - esteem . 
 although relaxation technique is simpler than the procedure of problem solving , the constitution of the classes and meetings for women can increase the self - esteem of subjects because women reach better understanding of the problem and solve it , while the relaxation technique was performed at home in a shorter time ( 20 min vs. 45 min sessions ) . 
 in addition to the above studies , the study of stephens in southern connecticut state university shows problem - solving training can boost the self - esteem of the participants . in this study , 
 self - esteem scores were measured by a scale rating 21 questions before and 3 months after intervention . 
 the average of self - esteem score increased after the intervention ( from 1.76 before intervention to 3.53 after intervention ) . 
 the results of study showed that this type of training can increase the self - esteem scores in men , as well as in special occasions such as domestic violence and mental health problems such as postpartum depression . 
 overall , the findings of the present study confirm that relaxation training and problem solving are successful as they can have an effect on a person 's self - concept and increase his / her self - esteem . 
 also , women with postpartum depression often use dysfunctional problem - solving styles in stressful situations . the styles and techniques of treatment that are representative of the style of problem solving including cognitive behavioral therapy are fit and advantageous for the treatment of psychiatric and behavioral problems and can help women suffering from postpartum depression . because of the importance of self - esteem during pregnancy and postpartum period , it is recommended that these two types of training programs are performed in pregnancy and the postpartum period with longer follow - up period . since the midwife as a primary carer in the postpartum period could play a role in the prevention and promotion of self - esteem in women with depression , it is recommended to consider and apply both types of training programs in health centers by trained midwives . 
 one of the study limitations was the time limit for performing this research in the pregnancy period . 
 also , this study was not practical as a double - blind method ; the researcher herself was responsible for training the women . 
 in addition , the relaxation technique was performed at home on a daily basis and so careful control by the researcher was not possible . 
 so , we attempted to ensure that these techniques were performed on a daily basis only with repeated phone calls and by encouraging women , as well as by providing educational cds . also , it was not possible to use from clinical interview by psychiatrist due to high costs during two stages ( before and after the intervention ) ; therefore , such as similar studies , only depression was measured using a standard questionnaire . 
 the strengths of this study is performance in three groups randomly and at various health centers . due to the lack of bias in the results 
 consideration of postpartum depression using two questionnaires in the first step and confirmation by the clinical psychologist in the next phase of the study is another strong point . 
 based on the results of this study and the relationship of self - esteem with depression and the major role of problem - solving skills in improving the self - esteem score , we suggest that this simple technique is performed in the health centers by midwives for increasing the self - esteem and decreasing the depressive symptoms , and thus improving the mental health . also , relaxation was effective in increasing self - esteem . 
 therefore , relaxation is proposed as an auxiliary or replacement method along with other methods in increasing the self - esteem .","study mahmoudi rad entitled role social problem solving communication skills training enhancing self esteem level relationship mental functioning academic achievement students found self esteem scores two groups showed significant difference intervention

"around the time of independence , the metaphor of madness is best exemplified by pandit jawaharlal nehru , who , in his address to the nation on january 31 , 1948 , the morning after the assassination of mahatma gandhi , said ,  a madman has put an end to his life , for i can only call him mad who did it . 
 events between 1857 and 1947 brought to the fore , both metaphorical concepts of madness and sanity as well as psychopathological manifestations of contemporary political preoccupations . 
 in 1857 , john nicholson planned his long march from his cantonment in punjab to delhi , to recapture delhi and overthrow the last mughal emperor , bahadur shah zaffar , who had become the center for the first war of independence . 
 nicholson was an irishman , an army commander , rather colorful , someone who could be called almost psychopathic . 
 he had allegedly impressed the sikhs so much with his reckless valor and dash , that he had a sect named after him as nickel - seyni 's , who were prepared to obey his orders to the end . 
 a year earlier , while at bannu in the north - west frontier , when a man with a long sword had rushed him one morning , nicholson , grabbing a musket from one of his guards , ordered him to put the sword down . 
 when the man refused , and insisted that  either he or i must die , 
 nicholson shot him dead , and commented in a letter that  the poor wretch turns out to be marwutee who had been religiously mad for some time  his spiritual instructor disappeared entirely , and i am afraid , gone into the hills . 
 in the aftermath of 1857 , in addition to the various hangings , beheadings , and blowing away from cannons , some individuals did find their way into lunatic asylums . as a soldier visiting the asylum in benares on august 24 
 , 1861 described :  among the many idiots there confined was one calling himself a pundit , who talked so fast and long as to the destruction of the europeans in india that one would almost credit him with sanity , were he not known to be otherwise ; vehement in his manner of delivery as to his determination in regard to all white faces he certainly must have had some knowledge of what had transpired in the mutiny and as we saw that he desired to continue his conversation on that topic the warder cut him short by ordering him into his cell and locking him up . 
 h , an irishman living in delhi , began saying that he had become a duke , and that his pay had been stolen by the british government and spent on buying oranges ( ! ) . 
 he converted to islam at the jama masjid , and took the name ahmed din . 
 he said he was on the way to kabul , as the russians were expected to help the muslims to overthrow the british . 
 he exhorted the muslims to unite , and get ready for the event , and meet the russians in peshawar . 
 across the road , in the garrison at the red fort , the british became very worried . 
 h had a deeper knowledge of the  great game  of kipling , or a prescient vision of the afghanistan and south asian power games of the europeans is unclear ! 
 this caused much consternation , and furore in delhi , because it was widely believed that he had been labeled insane for deciding to convert from christianity to islam , rather than the other way around . 
 the population of delhi was thought to be  highly excitable ,  as the events of 1857 had shown , and it was thought prudent to not keep him in the delhi asylum . 
 he was shifted to the asylum at colaba , bombay ( where there was a small asylum for the british , en route to the asylums in the uk ) maintained by the east india company . 
 the authorities perhaps realized the political impact of certain ideas , even though the source of these ideas could be defined to be bereft of reason . 
 in contrast , another patient in the delhi asylum wanted to help queen victoria , by interceding in the north west , and rule kabul on her behalf . mr . 
 imrit , in the delhi asylum in 1883 , claimed he was the descendant of the sen dynasty ( a hindu dynasty that ruled bengal in the 1112 centuries ) . 
 he said that he had leased india on contract to the british for 80 years , after which he would divide it between the russians and the chinese ( predating the dissensions among bengals intellectuals between marxist and maoist ideas by a century ) . 
 habib shah , who was discovered one morning in 1883 on the emperors throne at the diwan - e - am in the red fort , claiming to be the emperor , and the last of the mughal dynasty as he had been sent by nizam - ud - din ( the sufi patron saint of the mughal empire ) . 
 how he reached there , the fort being an army encampment , remained a mystery . in any case , when rulers call each other mad , madmen have every right to be rulers too ! ! whether the  great game  had already seeped into the consciousness of the community , including those who were admitted into the asylums ; or was it the creation of madmen that spread from the asylums into the community is still open to conjecture . 
 ideas about the independence of india gradually spread all over india and even in in the kingdom of mysore , patients were to occasionally describe such preoccupations . 
 as the politics of the region became more fractious and unreasonable , the growing communal problem was often viewed as a sign of madness . a tract written in 1943 set about describing the various machinations going on as the political insanity of india ( vakeel 1943 ) . 
 commenting on the  orgy of vituperation , slogans , alternating threats of civil disobedience and retirements into wilderness  indulging in torrents of verbosity 
 vakeel bemoans that by  exploiting passions on all sides  a  few are guiding the many to disaster  as they are responsible with their fantastic hallucinations and interpretations of freedom and slavery for a good deal of unhappiness in the country . 
 he was very worried that in the near future , many would suffer for the sins of a few and warned that  what i am writing is portentous  a few years later , when all that had been predicted had indeed come to pass , many commentators did indeed invoke the vision of madness as being responsible for the violence during the partition . early in september 1947 , gandhi referred to the violence following the declaration of independence as  let it be said of them that the inhabitants of delhi had gone mad temporarily but that sanity had now returned  . 
 since this recovery was short lived and frequent relapses of pointless violence and intemperate speech occurred , he again issued a plea for a  return to sanity ,  a few days before he was assassinated . 
 a reporter covering the funeral of mahatma gandhi , and sitting with nehru on the deck of the gun carriage that formed the cortege , commented on how the procession was delayed on the banks of the yamuna , by a madman dancing in front of the carriage . 
 the whole procession came to a halt , while the man was ( presumably kindly ) led , away . 
 many ideas that have guided recent history were once thought to be inimical to social order , even dangerous , or symptoms of madness . 
 we are all familiar with the persecution of galileo for overturning the shared belief that the sun revolved around the earth , and the many ideas of newton which transformed the world . 
 newton formally believed in alchemy , and wrote principia mathematica during a prolonged period of seclusion , allegedly an episode of nervous breakdown . 
 the world of politics is also well populated by accounts of the madness of kings , but it is the madness of the people often reflects the madness of their kings . 
 such notions of what stands in the realm of reality , wishful thinking , imagination and what borders on over - valued ideas or even delusions are resonant in contemporary times . 
 several books with titles such as imagining india and re - imagining india have emerged over the past two decades 
 . the borders between imagination and delusion being somewhat hazy , as these accounts show , in the clinical context , they could obviously be of concern , particularly in political and religious contexts . as pope pointed out in the 19 century , that being  irrational , the insane though in the state are not of the state . on the other hand , 
 although not of the state the insane are yet in the state.9  in view of this complexity , it is only logical that the borders between madman and the state are somewhat permeable , and both their histories intertwined .

"a 60-year - old lady presented to our sister department of medical gastroenterology at a tertiary health care institute with a history of an increasing mass in the right upper abdomen of one and a half year duration . 
 she also had a history of weight loss due to early satiety and decreasing appetite . 
 she had been evaluated with abdominal cect 14 months before by some local doctor which had shown a mass lesion in the right lobe of the liver . 
 all her systemic examinations were normal except a big nodular mass in the right hypochondrium merging with the liver . 
 the department of medical gastroenterology considered her for a repeat workup , with abdominal mri , rbc trigged nuclear scan of the liver , serum tumor markers and routine base investigations . 
 mri showed a nodular mass lesion arising from the right lobe of the liver , crossing towards the left lobe with involvement of the right portal vein , with areas of cystic changes and hemorrhage within the lesion ( fig . 
 her tumor markers , including -fetoprotein , cea , ca 19 - 9 and hcg , were all within normal limits . 
 she was also subjected to upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy to rule out any occult primary lesion in the gastrointestinal tract . 
 routine laboratory investigations including liver function tests , hemogram , kidney function , chest x - ray and ecg were within fairly normal limits , her coagulogram revealing pt elevated by 3 s. serology was negative for hepatitis b and c. she was also subjected to usg guided fnac which was inconclusive and revealed only blood cells . 
 after complete workup with a tentative diagnosis of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma the patient was referred to our department for surgical intervention . she was offered a diagnostic and if possible curative laparotomy after repeat imaging ( abdominal cect ) as she had again lapsed a period of 34 months after her workup . due to monitoring constraints 
 , her attenders did not agree to get an abdominal ct but were ready for any possible surgical intervention with the minimum of a biopsy to plan further treatment . on exploration 
 the patient was found to have nodular bilobular disease occupying almost all of the liver . 
 there were areas of boggy swelling in between firm nodules predominantly on the inferior surface of liver suggestive of bleeding within the tumor on aspiration . 
 the lesion involving both lobes of the liver was too big and multicentric for any resectional procedure and so a biopsy from the lesion was taken safely . 
 after getting her histopathological report the patient was referred to a medical oncologist for further treatment . 
 this is the first case of fibrosarcoma of the liver reported at our institute . on light 
 microscopy the tumor revealed homogeneous , spindle - shaped cells with abundant collagen fibers showing a classic herringbone pattern ( fig . 
 tissue samples were then sent to another referral cancer hospital for immunohistochemistry where immunoreactive vimentin was found in the tumor cells . 
 electron microscopically , the tumor cells were rich in rough endoplasmic reticulum without a basement membrane and were surrounded by large amounts of collagen fibers . 
 the purpose of this case report is to share information on a rare tumor of the liver , a primary fibrosarcoma , as up to the late seventies the literature about this entity was restricted to autopsy diagnosis . to our knowledge 
 there are case reports from various parts of the world [ 2 , 3 ] , but there are no series of cases of primary fibrosarcoma of the liver . 
 etiologically exposure to cadmium has been linked to carcinogenesis of this disease in animal models . 
 described a series of 20 cases of sarcomatous tumors of the liver , of which angiosarcoma was the commonest , and concluded that primary treatment is surgery with survival depending on the degree of differentiation . from the available literature , primary treatment to be considered for fibrosarcoma of the liver 
 is surgery with curative intent . in a recent article from sloan - kettering cancer center , between 1981 and 2004 they identified only 30 cases of primary liver sarcomas of which 
 most cases ( 10 ) were hemangioendotheliomas and only 3 were diagnosed to be primary fibrosarcoma . 
 only 11 of these patients underwent r0 resection and this group of resected tumors had a 5-year survival rate of 65% . 
 unfortunately our patient presented quite late in the course of disease even if we consider her first ct scan done one and a half year back . 
 there is a report of one patient with primary fibrosarcoma presenting with frequent episodes of hypoglycemia , where insulin - like growth factor ii was intensely stained in the golgi area of the tumor cells , suggesting its role in the mechanism of hypoglycemia . 
 on histopathological examination these neoplasms show typical light microscopic features like that of malignant rhabdoid tumor with filamentous cytoplasmic inclusions ( fig . 
 4 ) , and on electron microscopic examination show staining for both cytokeratin and vimentin by immunohistochemistry . after making a diagnosis of primary fibrosarcoma of the liver at an inoperable stage , 
 an extensive review of the literature regarding the role of other treatment modalities was done which was not encouraging [ 5 , 8 ] . though few reports recommend chemotherapy   in liver metastasis of retroperitoneal fibrosarcoma consisting of cyclophosphamide , vincristine , farmorubicin , and dacarbazine , there is no definite role as treatment for primary lesion of liver . 
 overall the prognosis reported by most of the authors is dismal [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 10 ] . 
 we conclude by passing on the message that this rare entity does exist and is an area for workup to make guidelines for management of such tumors . 
 this may be one of the few reported cases of primary hepatic fibrosarcoma confirmed by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy .","first case fibrosarcoma liver reported institute

"molecular photochromism 
 and high photostability are among the crucial 
 requirements for optically driven molecular memories , photoswitches , 
 and data processing materials . in this context special attention 
 is paid to aromatic schiff bases 
 whose photochemistry is governed by an ultrafast excited - state intramolecular 
 proton transfer ( esipt ) . in these molecules , 
 the decay of the initially formed excited - state 
 tautomer to the ground state can either lead back to the original 
 species by proton transfer or trap a portion of the excited molecules 
 in a ground - state metastable photochromic form . 
 basic 
 prerequisites for an efficient molecular photoswitch are 
 the presence of at least two stable photochromic forms in the ground 
 electronic state , lack of overlap between their absorption bands in 
 the relevant excitation region , and radiationless decay routes from 
 the franck 
 condon regions of both isomers leading to the other 
 switching form . in the literature 
 there are two main groups of chemical 
 compounds investigated in the context of molecular photoswitching , 
 which differ in their internal conversion mechanism : ring opening  ring 
 closure versus cis 
 esipt - exhibiting aromatic schiff bases introduce 
 a novel way to optically driven switching control : here , the cis  trans 
 photoisomerization is enabled ( at least from one side ) by the initial 
 excitation of an enol - form allowing for a chemical bond rearrangement 
 through proton transfer ( pt ) . 
 chemical structures relevant for the photoswitching 
 process and 
 general scheme of the photochemistry of salicylidene methylamine . in recent years 
 the photophysics 
 of aromatic schiff bases has been 
 intensively studied both experimentally and theoretically , and much 
 progress has been made toward an understanding of the underlying mechanisms . 
 however , in the context of molecular photoswitching , there are still 
 important questions to be answered . in this paper 
 we investigate the 
 photochemistry and photoswitching properties of an isolated molecule 
 containing the minimal schiff base chromophore 
 despite its simple structure , sma has been 
 studied less than other 
 model aromatic schiff bases , such as salicylidene aniline ( sa ) or 
 larger systems of similar type . from the experimental side , 
 the enol - form of sma has been identified 
 as the most populated ground - state isomer , and the photochromic behavior 
 observed in solution has been attributed to the formation of the keto - form . 
 the available experimental data ( absorption and transient absorption 
 spectra recorded in some nonprotic solvents ) indicate that no fluorescence signal is found upon uv  vis 
 excitation in the absorption band of the enol - form of sma . 
 moreover , 
 only a very weak emission is observed for lower - energy excitation 
 in the absorption band of the keto - form . 
 this suggests that sma undergoes 
 a barrierless esipt process followed by efficient nonradiative internal 
 conversion to the electronic ground state . 
 theoretical investigations 
 of sma photophysics performed so far include static energy landscape 
 calculations and wave packet photodynamics simulations of the esipt 
 process . 
 these studies 
 confirm barrierless pt in the first singlet excited state of sma and 
 point to the presence of a conical intersection arising from cc double 
 bond rotation as the main route for radiationless decay to the ground 
 state . in this work we present results of semiempirical on - the - fly 
 photodynamics 
 simulations for the two sma tautomers relevant to photoswitching : 
 the global minimum enol - form and 
 the photochromic keto - form ( denoted 
 later as  and  ; for chemical structures see figure 1 ) . 
 our main goal is to investigate the full switching 
 cycle and to determine the characteristic time scales and photoproduct 
 distributions of both the forward and back switching transformations . 
 the semiempirical calculations were performed using 
 the om2/mrci 
 method , as implemented in the mndo99 code . during dynamics simulations , all required energies , gradients 
 and nonadiabatic coupling elements 
 fock ( hf ) 
 formalism was applied in the self - consistent 
 field ( scf ) treatment ( i.e. , the orbitals were optimized for the leading 
 configuration of the s1 state with two singly occupied 
 orbitals ) . the active space in the multireference configuration interaction 
 ( mrci ) calculations included 10 electrons in 10 orbitals ( see the supporting information for plots of these orbitals ) . 
 in terms of the scf configuration , it comprised the four highest doubly 
 occupied orbitals , the two singly occupied orbitals , and the four 
 lowest unoccupied orbitals . 
 three configuration state functions were 
 chosen as references for the mrci treatment , namely the scf configuration 
 and the two closed - shell configurations derived therefrom ( i.e. , all 
 singlet configurations that can be generated from the homo and lumo 
 of the closed - shell ground state ) . 
 the mrci wave function was built 
 by allowing all single and double excitations from these three references . 
 this semiempirical om2/mrci approach has been recently shown to perform 
 well in a comprehensive general evaluation of excited - state properties and in a number of recent excited - state studies . in trajectory 
 surface - hopping dynamics the initial conditions 
 are 
 usually generated by wigner sampling , which defines 
 initial coordinates and velocities based on classical or quantum harmonic 
 vibrational modes , or by employing canonical classical molecular dynamics 
 ( md ) simulations , in which the canonical distribution is satisfied 
 with the use of a thermostat . here 
 , we adopted the second approach 
 applying the nose - hoover chains algorithm ( with a chain length of 10 ) for thermostatting . 
 we used the default 
 characteristic time of 0.01 ps for the thermostat and a time step 
 of 1 fs for nuclear motion . for both target molecules (  
 and  isomers ) , 
 4 ps of equilibration 
 dynamics were followed by a 100 ps production run , from which 600 
 initial atomic coordinates and velocities were randomly selected for 
 each molecule . 
 the starting points for the subsequent om2/mrci nonadiabatic 
 dynamics were chosen from this set on the basis of the computed s0 to s1 transition probabilities and the vertical 
 excitation energies . 
 a total of 321 surface - hopping trajectories for the  
 isomer and 333 for the  isomer were run up to 1 ps with all 
 relevant energies , gradients , and nonadiabatic coupling vectors being 
 computed on - the - fly as needed . for points with an s1  s0 energy 
 gap of less than 10 kcal / mol , 
 the time step was chosen 
 to be 0.2 fs for nuclear motion and 0.0005 fs for electronic propagation . 
 the unitary propagator evaluated at the middle point was used to propagate 
 electronic motion . 
 the empirical decoherence correction 
 ( 0.1 au ) proposed by granucci et al . was employed . 
 the final evaluations were done for the 259  and 
 306  trajectories that finished successfully and satisfied 
 our energy continuity criterion ( no changes greater than 30 kcal / mol 
 between any two consecutive md steps ) . 
 the scc - dftb sampling with 
 the nose - hoover chains technique was done with chemshell 3.4 and the nonadiabatic om2/mrci dynamics simulations were conducted 
 with mndo99 . 
 for specific validation of the om2/mrci method for sma , the relevant 
 isomers ( see figure 1 ) were optimized in the 
 ground and first excited states . 
 the first excited state is always of  * character in the om2/mrci calculations . for full geometrical structures 
 and corresponding ab initio results 
 the om2/mrci results are consistent 
 with the previously calculated 
 energy landscape . in the ground state 
 the  
 conformer is confirmed to be the most stable form and all other isomers , 
 except for  , are found to be planar  as indicated by 
 the given dihedral angles . in the first singlet 
 excited state the 
  isomer does not correspond to a minimum but transfers the 
 oh proton to the n atom upon geometry optimization , forming the  
 isomer in a barrierless esipt process . 
 in the course of the excited - state 
 optimization the  conformer relaxes to the ci2 conical intersection . 
 the calculated vertical excitation energies to the s1 state 
 are reasonably close to the published values obtained from high - quality 
 ab initio methods ( cc2/aug - cc - pvtz on mp2/cc - pvdz geometries ) , which are documented in the supporting information for easy reference . 
 vertical energy profiles 
 for sma calculated at the om2/mrci and 
 cc2/aug - cc - pvtz levels ( see text ) . for further validation 
 , vertical 
 potential energy profiles were 
 calculated at the om2/mrci level and compared with corresponding ab 
 initio data . 
 the profiles were computed 
 for the variation of three geometrical parameters most relevant to 
 sma photochemistry : the c1c7nc8 dihedral 
 angle relating isomers  and  ( denoted as cn from now 
 on ) , the oh distance relating isomers  and  , and the 
 c2c1c7n dihedral angle relating isomers 
  and  ( denoted as cc from now on ) . for each point on 
 the profile , the corresponding parameter was constrained to a fixed 
 value and a full ground - state optimization was carried out for all 
 other degrees of freedom . 
 the energy of the first excited state was 
 then obtained from a single - point calculation . 
 the profiles obtained 
 from the semiempirical om2/mrci calculations and from single - point 
 ab initio cc2/aug - cc - pvtz calculations on mp2/cc - pvdz geometries are 
 very similar to each other and agree with regard to all important 
 features pertinent to sma photochemistry . in particular , they show 
 a barrierless proton transfer path in the first excited state and 
 exhibit only very small barriers for the excited - state deactivation 
 via ci1 and for the ground - state proton back transfer . 
 the small bumps 
 in the regions near the conical intersections are due to minor sudden 
 changes in the optimized geometries . 
 after vertical excitation to the 
 first singlet excited state , both the  enol - form and the  
 keto - form of sma undergo an ultrafast deactivation to the ground state . 
 in both cases 
 the average state populations during the  and  photodynamics 
 are plotted in figure 3 against the simulation 
 time . 
 the data are fitted by a sigmoid function ( see eq 1 ) which provides an approximate decay time . 
 the lifetime of 
 the excited state is defined as the point at which half of the trajectories 
 have decayed to the ground state . 
 the parameter k denotes the fraction of trajectories 
 that decay until the end of the simulation.1 the deactivation of the  isomer 
 may be realized through two different phototransformations 
 ( i ) the esipt process followed by cc bond twist or ( ii ) the photoisomerization 
 around the cn bond ( direct cis  trans transformation ) . 
 150 fs which 
 makes it slower by around 50 fs in comparison with the excited - state 
 decay of the  form ( see figure 3 ) . within 
 the total simulation time of 1 ps 
 , the internal conversion to the 
 ground state is very efficient for both sma forms  less than 
 6% ( 9% ) of the trajectories are left in the excited state for the 
  (  ) photodynamics , respectively 
 . the slightly higher 
 number of such trajectories in the  case may be attributed 
 to the very flat shape of the s1 potential energy surface 
 ( pes ) in the franck 
 condon region and the lack of excess kinetic 
 energy from esipt ( compared with the  case ) . 
 average state populations 
 for the two sets of trajectories ( left : 
  isomer ; right :  isomer ) . 
 figure 4 and 
 figure 5 show the time evolution of key 
 parameters characterizing the photodynamical trajectories of the  
 and  isomers , respectively . 
 the plots for the two sample runs 
 include : the dihedral angle of cc and cn rotations , the oh and nh 
 distances , the s0 and s1 energies relative to 
 the global ground - state minimum of the  isomer , and the energy 
 gap between these two states . 
 blue vertical lines mark the hopping 
 events between the two energy surfaces , while the red lines indicate 
 an intramolecular proton transfer . to facilitate the analysis of the 
 graphs , the geometrical structures present at each stage of the dynamics 
 are indicated by a corresponding label ( i.e. ,  ,  ,  , 
 or  ) . 
 after photoexcitation occurs an 
 ultrafast proton transfer to the n atom ( finished within 30 fs ) accompanied 
 by a clear reduction of the s1/s0 energy gap . 
 a subsequent rotational motion takes the system toward the ci1 conical 
 intersection , where it hops to the ground state at a simulation time 
 of ca . 
 700 fs ) ; cc rotation is not feasible in the ground 
 state , because during s1  s0 deactivation 
 the 
 * orbital localized at the cc bond becomes unocuppied and 
 thus the energy barrier for cc rotation rises significantly . 
 the ground - state 
 proton transfer from the nitrogen back to the oxygen atom then occurs 
 at ca . 
 850 fs , regenerating the  isomer and restoring the interstate 
 energy gap to its initial value . at this point ,

 mark multiples of 180 ; top right : distances ; bottom left : state 
 energies ; bottom right : energy difference . 
 the trajectory starting from the  isomer in figure 5 shows a faster , single - step deactivation involving 
 only cc bond rotation ( there is no need for esipt to open the route 
 toward the ci ) . 
 70 fs and 
 thereafter exhibits a similar behavior as on the previously discussed 
  trajectory . a difference between the two  and  
 simulations can be seen in the oh and nh stretching amplitudes , which 
 should be associated with the ease of proton back transfer in the 
 ground state . after roaming on the s0 pes in the vicinity 
 of the  isomer for ca . 
 350 fs , the proton is transferred from 
 the n back to the o atom , and the system ends up in the  form . 
 top left : dihedrals , horizontal dashed lines 
 mark multiples of 180 ; top right : distances ; bottom left : state 
 energies ; bottom right : energy difference . in line with a previously 
 proposed scheme 
 , we have analyzed the 
 sma isomers observed during the dynamics simulations in terms of photochemical 
 classes . depending on the values of the three key internal degrees 
 of freedom ( cn dihedral , cc dihedral , and oh distance ) we assign the 
 starting , hopping , and final structures from each trajectory to the 
  ,  ,  , or  sets ( for precise class definitions 
 see the supporting information ) . within 
 one particular photochemical class 
 all sma conformers are interconvertible 
 by rotations around single bonds that usually require only little 
 energy . 
 all class members have similar uv absorption spectra which 
 are , however , distinct from those of different - class representatives . 
 figure 6 shows results of such a structure 
 population analysis for the  photodynamics . at the starting 
 point 
 , the two key dihedral angles do not differ much from the optimum 
 values of 0 and 180 of the initial  isomer ( left panel ) . by 
 contrast , the hopping points ( middle panel ) have twisted structures , 
 with at least one of the two key dihedral angles differing strongly 
 from 0 and 180. these hopping points are concentrated in two 
 areas : cc  90 and cn  [ 120 160 ] 
 and cn  90 and cc  [ 0  30 ] . 
 this reflects the competition between two internal conversion pathways 
 proceeding through the ci1 and ci2 conical intersections . 
 the first 
 one , involving esipt followed by cc bond rotation , happens much more 
 frequently than the second one , involving cn bond photoisomerization 
 ( ca . 
 condon point to ci1 is essentially barrierless and 
 initiated by the ultrafast esipt process , while at the same time there 
 is a small barrier on the route to the alternative ci2 conical intersection . 
 in the right panel with the final structures ( final points of the 
 simulation )

 forms   and   are strongly preferred 
 over the other two structures . 
 the small amount of the  form 
 represents the photoproducts of the alternative deactivation mechanism 
 via ci2 . on a somewhat longer time scale , 
 the initially produced  
 isomers are expected to undergo a nearly barrierless ground - state 
 proton back transfer transforming them into the  photochemical 
 class . 
 the collected data also allow an estimate of the splitting 
 ratio at both conical intersections . comparing the overall number 
 of final structures classified as  and  that arise from 
 hopping around ci1 with the number of final  isomers , one gets 
 a 1:1 ratio . 
 an analogous analysis for the ci2 conical intersection 
 ( involving the  and  structures coming from the deactivation 
 at ci2 ) also gives a 1:1 ratio . 
 again , 
 the trajectories start in the vicinity 
 of the initial minimum ( left panel ) .

 to the ci1 conical intersection ( middle panel ) .

 color code for assignment to isomers :

 blue  . the product distribution in the two photodynamics simulations 
 gives 
 valuable information about the expected photoswitching efficiency 
  the extent of the initial - to - final transformation at the 
 end of the simulation may be considered as one of its possible measures . 
 comparison of the ::: ratio for the onward 
 (  photodynamics ) and backward (  photodynamics ) switching 
 shows better performance of the latter . the initial - to - final conversion 
 ( counting the  population as future  class ) amounts 
 to 50% for the    and to 90% for the  
   phototransformation . 
 these percentages almost perfectly 
 reflect the splitting ratio at ci1  the conical intersection 
 responsible for the dominant internal conversion mechanism in sma . 
 therefore , it is worthwhile to focus attention on the structural bifurcation 
 at ci1 . the splitting ratio may be explained in terms of the interplay 
 between the effects of momentum conservation and coupling to the local density of states . 
 the first factor , 
 understood as favorable continuation of the rotational motion driving 
 the system to a conical intersection , always supports direct passing 
 through the ci and , thus , the photoswitching . 
 the second one , a purely 
 quantum effect , enters the dynamics through vibrational mode relaxation 
 that occurs after the hop to the ground state . 
 this vibrational cooling 
 is more efficient for the more pronounced ( deeper and/or wider ) of 
 the minima adjacent to the splitting ci point , which in our case is 
 the  isomer . 
 one should notice that in the  photodynamics 
 these two effects act against each other leading to a rather even 
 splitting distribution , while in the  case they act in the 
 same direction and thus favor formation of the  isomer . 
 figure 8 shows the time evolution of the 
 photochemical class populations for both photodynamics : 
 after excitation of the 
  form , one observes an ultrafast  to  transformation 
 ( esipt ) occurring mainly in the first 30 fs of the simulation ; this 
 is in very good agreement with previous theoretical results and with experimental findings for similar systems . 
 50 fs after the excitation , 
 the population of the  form starts to grow which , after rising 
 to a 5% value , stays constant until the simulation ends . 
 this confirms , 
 as expected , that in the s1 state an intramolecular ballistic 
 transfer of a light proton occurs faster than a rotation around the 
 cn bond . 
 consequently , the internal conversion through ci1 plays a 
 predominant role in sma photodynamics . 
 further analysis of the left 
 panel of figure 8 ( 100 fs < t < 200 fs ) shows that the  population , after reaching its 
 maximum arising from the esipt process , decreases rapidly . at the 
 same time 
 70 fs after the pt ) the amount of  
 isomer starts to grow with a similar rate . 
 this reflects the internal 
 conversion process with a bifurcation between the  and  
 forms and is consistent with the previously estimated s1 excited - state lifetime . 
 after 200 fs the  population stabilizes 
 at its final value , and one observes an almost linear decrease ( increase ) 
 in the population of the  (  ) isomer , which continues 
 until the end of the 1 ps simulation . assuming this trend to continue , 
 the full switching process would be finished around 1.6 ps after the 
 initial photoexcitation of the  isomer , which is again in agreement 
 with experimental observations for analogous schiff base systems . from the right panel of figure 8 one 
 may 
 learn about the time characteristics of the back - switching process 
 starting with an excitation of the  form . 
 at the very beginning 
 the system stays close to the initial structure and then , again after 
 ca . 
 this happens 
 through internal conversion at ci1 with bifurcation between these 
 two forms , similarly as in the previously discussed  photodynamics . 
 population of the  isomer initializes the subsequent  
 to  transformation , which again proceeds almost linearly with 
 time . 
 concomitantly , the  population reached after the s1 to s0 deactivation remains constant , and no traces 
 of the  form are observed . in analogy 
 to the analysis for the 
  case , the overall  switching time scale may be estimated 
 as ca . 2.0 ps . 
 in this paper we investigated 
 the full photoswitching cycle of 
 an isolated sma molecule by means of the semiempirical on - the - fly 
 photodynamics simulations . 
 for the two isomers that play a crucial 
 role in the switching (  and  ) , we find a very efficient 
 internal conversion ( 90% nonradiative decay of the excited 
 state ) that indicates excellent photostability and promising switching 
 efficiency of sma . 
 the computed time scales characterizing the crucial 
 phototransformations of this model schiff base system are all in the 
 ultrafast regime ( 1 ps and subpicosecond ) . 
 the simulations 
 predict that the switching process is reversible in sma and that the 
 competing photoisomerization around the cn bond plays only a minor 
 role in the photochemistry of this system . 
 the detailed analysis of 
 structural time evolution provides direct insight into the internal 
 conversion and switching mechanisms . 
 the strong dependence of the 
 splitting ratio at the ci1 conical intersection on the photoswitching 
 direction probably originates from the ground - state pes topology of 
 the  and  switching forms . 
 ; cyan   +  ; violet   ; 
 blue . the esipt - based photoswitching mechanism in sma involves 
 pronounced 
 reorganization of the electron density accompanied by only minor changes 
 in its geometrical structure . 
 this should allow for switching selectivity 
 due to the strong photochromism and should also ensure structural 
 stability , which are both important factors in the design of molecular 
 electronics devices . in summary 
 , we believe that aromatic schiff bases 
 may have advantages over many previously proposed molecular photoswitching 
 systems because of their ultrafast photochemistry , high photostability , 
 and good excitation selectivity , and that they may thus be considered 
 as promising candidates for future photodriven molecular electronics 
 materials .","studies confirm barrierless pt first singlet excited state sma point presence conical intersection arising cc double bond rotation main route radiationless decay ground state

"takotsubo cardiomyopathy is characterized by transient left ventricular ( lv ) regional wall motion abnormalities and usually involves apical segments in the absence of significant coronary artery stenosis . in the recent years , several cases on atypical forms of transient lv ballooning syndrome have been reported . 
 the pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear , however , the catecholamine excess and increased sympathetic activity are likely to play a pivotal role in triggering this syndrome.1 - 3 ) in this report , we describe an unusual case of a 38-year - old woman who had pulmonary embolism ( pe ) and reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy . 
 pe has been listed as stressors of stress - induced cardiomyopathy,2)3 ) because the pain and the decreased perfusion within the lung related to pe probably cause a release of catecholamines.4)5 ) however , it is uncommon to present reverse types of stress - induced cardiomyopathy in the setting of pe for our patient . 
 a 38-year - old woman with no history of cardiac diseases or cardiac risk factors was referred to our emergency department because of chest discomforts , arrhythmia and shortness of breath after the surgery . a few days before she had fallen off the ladder and underwent surgery for right lateral malleolar fracture under spinal anesthesia . 
 physical examination revealed vital signs as follows : blood pressure 90/60 mm hg , heart rate 75 beats / min , body temperature 36.7 , respiratory rate 22/min and oxygen saturation 88% on room air . 
 the electrocardiogram ( ecg ) recording showed sinus rhythm , st - segment depression in v3 through v5 , and there were no typical features of ecg abnormalities associated with pe such as sinus tachycardia , s1q3t3 pattern , complete and incomplete rbbb , and t wave inversion ( fig . 
 chest radiography showed diffuse increased bronchovascular lung markings with mild congestion and edema , d - dimer was elevated to 1572 ng / ml ( normal reference range 0 - 243 ng / ml ) and altered results of the arterial blood gas analysis ( ph 7.42/pco2 25.8 mm hg / po2 69.7 mm hg / hco3 16.4 mmol / l ) aroused suspicion of pe . 
 it was confirmed by computed tomography and thus , therapy with heparin infusion was initiated ( fig . 
 other laboratory findings indicated white blood cell counts of 10000/mm ; hemoglobin 9.7 g / dl ; platelet count 275000/mm ; c - reactive protein 0.0 mg / dl ; alanine aminotransferase 18 u / l ; aspartate aminotransferase 39 u / l ; total bilirubin 0.46 mg / dl ; and serum creatinine 0.7 mg / dl . 
 the cardiac enzyme levels were elevated with a peak level of creatine kinase - mb isoform 27 ng / ml ( normal reference range 0 - 3.6 ng / ml ) and troponin i 5.30 ng / ml ( normal reference range 0 - 0.1 ng / ml ) . 
 transthoracic echocardiography showed hypokinesia of mid / base segments of lv with hypercontraction of apical segments and reduced ejection fractions estimated at 47% with no significant valvular dysfunctions . 
 right ventricular systolic dysfunction or dilated right ventricle was not found , and yet an estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure increased mildly to 43 mm hg on the assumption of right arterial pressure of 10 mm hg ( tricuspid regurgitation peak velocity : 2.87 m / s ) ( fig . 
 coronary angiography was immediately performed within an hour of admission and ruled out obstructive atherosclerotic diseases . 
 she was managed with medical therapy using -blocker and diuretics.2)3)6)7 ) angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors was not indicated because of mild hypotensions . after the medical treatment , the patient was presented free of symptoms for the following few days . 
 transthoracic echocardiography was undergone 1 week after her admission and showed improvements in ejection fractions of 58% with no wall motion abnormalities ( fig . 
 the patient was discharged in good clinical conditions and remained well after 3 months of follow - up . 
 takotsubo cardiomyopathy , also known as apical ballooning syndrome , is generally characterized as severe , reversible lv dysfunctions of apical segments . 
 variants , the non - apical ballooning syndrome , have been recognized as reversed , mid - ventricular , and localized type based on the involvement of the left ventricular.8 ) our case is consistent with the reverse type , hyperdynamic apex and akinesia of the mid / base segments of lv . 
 compared to typical lv ballooning syndrome , this atypical form of transient lv ballooning syndromes have different characteristics of patients.6)8 ) hahn et al.6 ) described that patients with atypical transient lv ballooning syndrome were younger with the mean age of 36 and had fewer coronary risk factors such as hypertensions , diabetes , and smoking habits . 
 also , t wave inversion in an ecg was found as less similar to our patient . 
 however , according to the recent reviews and many published clinical cases , the excessive catecholamine and exaggerated sympathetic activities are greatly accountable.1 - 3)9 - 11 ) differences in anatomical location and density of cardiac adrenergic receptors and the degree of sympathetic activity may explain the wall motion abnormalities as seen in the typical and reverse types.8)11)12 ) clinical presentations and transient nature of lv wall motion abnormalities in reverse type are similar to those of classic takotsubo cardiomyopathy which could indicate a possibility of sharing pathophysiological mechanisms , and yet , none of related evidences has been revealed . 
 estrogens , which have a protective effect on cathecholamine - induced toxicity , appear to have influences on the preponderances of postmenopausal women toward takotsubo cardiomyopathy.1)2)13 ) however , further researches for the interaction of catecholamines and estrogen are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms of stress - induced cardiomyopathy at a younger age without estrogen deficiency , and the specific reasons for rare presentations of men with physiologically estrogen - deficient . 
 takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been described with a wide range of emotional or physical stressful triggers . 
 herein , we report a middle - aged woman with inverted takotsubo cardiomyopathy in the setting of pe , which is a rare coexistence for this association . 
 the exact mechanisms of the relation between pe and atypical takotsubo cardiomyopathy are not clear . but increased catecholamine levels during severe pain and perfusion defect within the lung related to pe seem to result in the development of lv wall motion abnormalities.4)5 ) in this case , it is difficult to detect pe and reverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy independently , due to the fact that both clinical features mimic acute coronary syndromes . despite of the poor sensitivity and specificity of ecg abnormalities to diagnose pe and inverse takotsubo cardiomyopathy , there are several frequent features including sinus tachycardia , both complete and incomplete rbbb , s1q3t3 pattern , and st - segment elevation , non specific t wave abnormalities , respectively.2)4 - 6 ) a transthoracic echocardiography ( tte ) provide the evidence of pe such as right ventricular systolic dysfunctions and pulmonary hypertensions,4)5 ) and stress - induced cardiomyopathy may have right ventricular involvement which is associated with more severe impairments in lv systolic functions.14 ) thus , it is important to carry out ecg promptly , tte and coronary angiography based on a high degree of clinical suspicions . 
 further research is needed to elucidate this relationship and different pathophysiological mechanisms for various ventricular morphologies of stress - induced cardiomyopathy . 
 diagnosing pe especially in a patient with characteristics of acute coronary syndrome such as stressinduced cardiomyopathy can be difficult . 
 it needs to be highlighted that pe should be considered as a potential stressor once the reverse takotsubo syndrome is suspected .","takotsubo cardiomyopathy characterized transient left ventricular lv regional wall motion abnormalities usually involves apical segments absence significant coronary artery stenosis

"the successful isolation 
 of individual layers of graphene in 2004 has triggered an intense interest in its unique 
 structural and electronic properties . a 
 very high carrier mobility along with weak spin 
 orbit and hyperfine 
 interactions predestinates graphene as a promising material for spintronics , 
 mainly if magnetic ordering can be introduced 
 . however , due to the delocalized  bonding network , ideal graphene 
 is intrinsically nonmagnetic . 
 therefore , developing effective methods 
 for synthesizing ferromagnetic ( fm ) graphene with high magnetization 
 is vital for applications in novel spintronic devices combining charge 
 and spin manipulation . 
 a number of factors including atomic vacancies , 
 zigzag edges , sp functionalization , and 
 chemical doping of foreign atoms can induce localized magnetic moments 
 in graphene , which are indispensable for the existence of magnetic 
 ordering . among these strategies , doping of the graphene lattice with noncarbon 
 atoms has been identified as a promising approach for imprinting magnetic 
 ordering into graphene while preserving / enhancing its electric / optical 
 properties , as desirable for spintronic , optoelectronic , and magnetooptical 
 applications . 
 substitutional doping of graphene by light elements 
 has recently 
 attracted much attention ( see , e.g. , refs ( 1114 ) ) . 
 in particular , 
 nitrogen doping of the graphene lattice has been extensively studied , 
 aimed at tuning the graphene electronic features , and hence its physical 
 properties , in order to meet the requirements of a given application . 
 n - doped graphenes have been tested as active materials for li - ion 
 batteries , fuel cells , field - effect transistors , ultra- 
 and supercapacitors , and in the fields of photocatalysis and electrochemical biosensing . 
 chaban and prezhdo have argued that graphene structures containing 1/3 of nitrogen atoms or less 
 should be stable up to 1000 k provided n 
 having similar atomic size and one 
 additional electron compared to a carbon atom , nitrogen acts as an n - type ( electron - donating ) dopant by increasing the number 
 of electrons when substituted into the graphene lattice , thus affecting 
 the graphene electric conductivity . 
 the substitution of carbon by 
 nitrogen atoms in the graphene lattice necessarily leads to changes 
 in the electronic density of states , and graphitic nitrogen can provide 
  electrons close to the fermi level of graphene . 
 if the itinerant 
 electrons occupy narrow bands at the fermi level , stoner magnetism 
 can emerge , as recently shown for graphene doped with sulfur . 
 indeed , it has been theoretically proposed that depending on the concentration and packing 
 geometry of doping nitrogen atoms , it is possible to induce a magnetic 
 response in graphene . 
 however , the physical mechanism governing the 
 emergence of magnetically ordered structures was not discussed . until 
 now , all the experimental attempts to imprint magnetism into graphene 
 through n - doping have failed . recently , a detailed theoretical and 
 experimental magnetic study revealed that introduction of pyrrolic 
 nitrogen into the graphene lattice decreases the magnetization values 
 compared to those observed for defective graphene . 
 % ) was identified to enhance ferromagnetism in highly oxidized 
 graphene ( i.e. , graphene oxide ) synthesized via hydrothermal reaction . 
 fm behavior has also been reported in other 
 nitrogen - doped graphene oxide systems . however , n - doped graphene oxides are unsatisfactory because a high 
 amount of oxygen ( sp functionalization ) 
 is regarded as a dominant source of magnetism , overwhelming the effects 
 of nitrogen doping itself . 
 moreover , oxygen - containing functional 
 groups drastically reduce the electric conductivity of graphene  the 
 main prerequisite for spintronic technologies . 
 thus , development of 
 fm n - doped graphene with negligible oxygen content and elucidation 
 of the effect of various nitrogen configurations ( pyrrolic , pyridinic , 
 graphitic , chemisorbed ) remains a key challenge in the fields of nanotechnologies , 
 magnetism , and spintronics . in this work , 
 we first report the emergence of a magnetically 
 ordered 
 state in graphene doped solely with nitrogen . 
 % of nitrogen , the doping - induced paramagnetic 
 centers commenced to interact magnetically , resulting in establishment 
 of fm ordering at temperatures below 69 k. in the fm state , 
 the saturation magnetization reached 1.09 emu / g , which is 
 among the highest values reported so far for doped graphene - based 
 systems . 
 dft calculations demonstrated that graphitic nitrogen was 
 dominantly responsible for evolution of the magnetically active configurations . 
 in contrast , pyridinic and chemisorbed nitrogen had a considerably 
 lower effect on imprinting the magnetism into graphene . 
 this finding 
 opens possibilities for an extensive research in spintronic and magnetooptical 
 technologies based on graphitic n - doped graphene . 
 graphite microparticles 
 ( 215 m , 
 99.9995% , alfa aesar ) were used for all syntheses . sulfuric acid ( 98% ) , 
 nitric acid ( 68% ) , potassium chlorate ( 99% ) , hydrochloric acid ( 37% ) , 
 silver nitrate ( 99.5% ) , and barium nitrate ( 99.5% ) were obtained from 
 penta , czech republic . 
 nitrogen ( 99.9999% purity ) and ammonia ( 99.9995% 
 purity ) were obtained from siad , czech republic . 
 briefly , sulfuric acid ( 98% , 87.5 
 ml ) and nitric acid ( 68% , 27 ml ) were added to a reaction flask ( pyrex 
 beaker with thermometer ) containing a magnetic stir bar . 
 graphite ( 5 g ) 
 was then added to the mixture under vigorous stirring and , keeping 
 the reaction flask in the ice bath , potassium chlorate ( 55 g ) was 
 slowly added . after a complete dissolution of potassium chlorate , 
 the reaction flask was loosely capped to allow the escape of gas evolved 
 and the mixture was continuously stirred for 96 h at room temperature . 
 the 
 obtained graphene oxide was then redispersed in hcl solution ( 5% , 
 3 l ) to remove sulfate ions and repeatedly centrifuged and redispersed 
 in deionized water until a negative reaction on chloride and sulfate 
 ions with silver and barium nitrate was achieved . 
 the resulting graphite

 were prepared by combined exfoliation and 
 reduction of graphite oxide in an ammonia atmosphere .

 to a magnetic manipulator and mounted in a horizontal quartz glass

 afterward , 
 the mixture was transferred into a 10 ml volumetric flask , diluted 
 with water and any undissolved graphene was separated using a 200 
 nm millipore filter . 
 the measured concentration of metals in the solution 
 was recalculated to the amount in the tested sample ( analogically , 
 diluted nitric acid was used as a blank ) . the atomic percent 
 of c , o , and n , and types of bonds were assessed by x - ray photoelectron 
 spectroscopy ( xps ) , employing a phi 5000 versaprobe ii xps system 
 ( physical electronics ) equipped with a monochromatic al k source ( 15 kv , 50 w ) with a photon energy of 1486.7 ev . 
 all the xps 
 patterns were measured in a vacuum of 1.4  10 pa and at room temperature ( 22 c ) . for high resolution xps

 xps patterns were evaluated with a multipak ( ulvac , phi , inc . ) 
 all binding energy values were referenced to the c 1s peak 
 at 284.80 ev . 
 raman spectra were acquired using a dxr raman 
 spectroscope ( thermo

 the respective sample was first deposited on a glass platform 
 and the excitation laser was focused on its surface . 
 the laser power on the sample was set to 5 mw and the exposition time 
 was 20 s. each measured raman spectrum was an average of 16 experimental

 measurements were performed in an open -al2o3 crucible under an argon atmosphere ( 80 cm min ) . 
 a temperature program from 40 to 1000 c with 
 a heating rate of 5 k min was used .

 were performed using a physical property measurement system ( ppms ) 
 equipped with a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm ) from quantum design ,

 hysteresis loops were measured over the temperature range from 
 5 to 300 k and under static external magnetic fields ranging from 
 50 to + 50 koe . 
 temperature profiles of the mass magnetic susceptibility , 
 mass , were recorded in a sweep mode over a temperature 
 range from 5 to 300 k in a field of 1 koe after cooling in a field 
 of 1 koe . 
 magnetization values were corrected assuming the response 
 of the sample holder , sample capsule , and respective pascal constants . 
 atomistic calculations were performed 
 using a spin - polarized density functional theory ( dft ) and projected 
 augmented wave potentials ( paw ) representing atomic cores as implemented 
 in the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) . 
 electronic 
 exchange and correlation effects were treated by using the perdew , 
 burke , and ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized - gradient 
 approximation ( gga ) with a plane wave cutoff of 600 ev . 
 brillouin 
 zone integrations were performed with a 6  6  1  
 point - centered monkhorst 
 pack k - point mesh 
 per conventional 4  3 rectangular cell ( structure and cell optimization ) . 
 the electronic density of states was calculated using the tetrahedron 
 method with a 21  21  1 k - point mesh . 
 partitioning of the ground state electronic 
 density into contributions attributed to the different atoms was performed 
 exploiting the bader analysis . 
 total magnetic moments were calculated 
 from the difference between the number of electrons in occupied majority- 
 and minority - spin states . 
 local magnetic moments were calculated by 
 projecting the plane - wave components of all the occupied eigenstates 
 onto spherical waves inside an atomic sphere and integrating the resulting 
 local density of states . 
 a full structural optimization was 
 performed using a quasi - newton algorithm until the residual atomic 
 forces were lower than 25 mev  . 
 simultaneously , 
 the electronic and magnetic degrees of freedom were converged to an 
 energy of less than 10 ev . 
 the stability of the 
 reported configurations was analyzed in terms of the formation energy , ef , of the n - doped complexes using the formula 
 given as ef = 1/n[edpd  egraph + n(c  n ) ] , where edpd and egraph stand for the total energies of the doped and pristine 
 graphene sheet , respectively , c and n are the chemical potentials of c and n atoms , respectively 
 ( here , approximated by the atomic energies of c and n ) , and n is the number of substituted atoms . 
 a positive ef indicates that the doping process is endothermic , 
 although it does not hinder the formation of thermodynamically stable 
 complexes . 
 the adsorption energy ( ead ) per n atom 
 ( n = 1 and 2 ) on a pristine layer was calculated 
 as the total energy difference between the energy of an adatom - graphene 
 complex , en / graph , a clean graphene layer , egraph , and an isolated n atom in the gas - phase , en , i.e. , ead = 1/n(en / graph  egraph  nen ) . 
 similarly , the adsorption energy of on - surface nitrogen 
 on n - doped graphene was calculated as the total energy difference 
 between the energy of a doped graphene with an adatom , en / dpd , a doped graphene sheet , edpd , and a gas - phase n atom , i.e. , ead = en / dpd  edpd  en . 
 to study the role of n - doping on imprinting 
 magnetic features into 
 graphene , three samples differing in nitrogen content were prepared ; 
 the level of doping was solely controlled by the temperature , while 
 all other synthetic parameters were kept constant . 
 the trgo sample 
 was synthesized as a reference blank sample for which no source of 
 nitrogen ( i.e. , ammonia atmosphere ) was used during the thermal reduction 
 of graphite oxide . 
 the reduction process was found to be highly efficient , 
 as evident from the very low content of oxygen ( 1 at . 
 % , see the survey 
 and high - resolution c 1s xps pattern in figure s1a , b in supporting information ) . 
 the paramagnetic / fm 
 response of graphene evolved due to defects and/or functionalization 
 is of several orders of magnitude lower compared to that of 3d - block metals , such as iron , cobalt , nickel , and manganese . 
 hence , the results of magnetization measurements may be incorrectly 
 interpreted if these  strong  magnetic elements are 
 present in the system as a consequence of using reactants containing 
 3d - block metals and/or the sample handling . 
 thus , icp - ms was employed to quantify the presence 
 of 3d metal impurities and exclude their effect on 
 the magnetic properties of n - doped graphenes . the total concentration 
 of fe , ni , co , and mn , regarded as the main magnetic impurities in 
 trgo and n - doped graphene samples , was below 10 ppm ( see table s1 
 in supporting information ) . taking into 
 account the determined concentrations and magnetic moments of the 
 metal impurities , 
 the total mass of fe , ni , co , 
 and mn was estimated to be of the order of 10 emu 
 g oe at 0 k and in a 1 koe 
 field . as mass values for trgo and n - doped graphene 
 systems reached orders from 10 down to 10 emu g oe in 
 a 1 koe field ( see below ) , the contribution of fe , ni , co , and mn 
 to the samples mass was assumed to be negligible 
 in measurements of temperature evolution of mass and hysteresis loops , thus definitely not overshadowing the magnetic 
 properties of graphene induced solely by nitrogen doping . 
 doping 
 of graphene with nitrogen was monitored by xps and raman 
 spectroscopy . in survey xps patterns recorded for n - doped graphene 
 samples , peaks belonging to c , n , and 
 o were clearly observed ( see 
 figure s2 and table s2 in supporting information ) . 
 the content of nitrogen was found to increase progressively with 
 the temperature at which the thermal reduction of graphite oxide in 
 the presence of ammonia was conducted ( i.e. , 400 c , 1.5 at . 
 the presence of nitrogen was further evidenced in the high - resolution 
 c 1s xps profile , which showed the emergence of a peak at a binding 
 energy of around 285.5 ev corresponding to the c 
 n spectral component increased 
 in area with the level of n - doping . a small shift in the maximum of 
 the c 
 n peak witnessed for the three n - doped graphene samples 
 can be explained in terms of impossibility to distinguish differently 
 coordinated nitrogen atoms with carbon atoms in graphene with similar 
 binding energy values in the c 1s domain and the significant overlap 
 of the c  n and c  o spectral components . 
 high - resolution 
 n 1s xps patterns of n - doped graphene samples ( see figure 2 and figure s3 and table s3 
 in supporting information ) showed three 
 distinct peaks corresponding to nitrogen in different configurations 
 inside a graphene lattice or attached covalently to a graphene sheet 
 ( see figure 3 ) , i.e. , 
 pyridinic nitrogen ( at 398.3 to 398.5 ev ) , graphitic 
 nitrogen ( at 401.0 to 401.5 ev ) , and chemisorbed n / n2 ( at 404.5 to 405.5 ev ) . in contrast , no traces 
 of pyrrolic nitrogen , usually present at 400.0 ev , were observed 
 ( compare the high - resolution n 1s xps patterns shown in figure 2 and figure s3 in supporting information with figure 3 ) . 
 the pyridinic and graphitic nitrogen were viewed as nitrogen incorporated 
 inside the graphene lattice , whereas chemisorbed n / n2 was 
 viewed as nitrogen adsorbed as adatoms . 
 the presence of n / n2 was further confirmed by tga and ega techniques with gas electron 
 ionization mass spectrometry , indicating emission of a fragment with m / z = 28 ( for n / n2 ) above 300 
 c ( see figure s4 in supporting information ) . 
 in addition , as no fragments with m / z = 30 and 48 were detected , the samples were considered free of any 
 no and no2 species , respectively . 
 this agrees with the 
 analysis of the raman spectra of n - doped graphene samples as no raman 
 peaks around 1430 cm , characteristic for no and 
 no2 species , are observed 
 ( see figure 1b , d , f ) .

 scheme showing different bonding configurations of nitrogen 
 in 
 n - doped graphene and corresponding peaks in a simulated high - resolution 
 n 1s xps pattern . 
 raman spectra of the 
 gn0.015 , gn0.033 , gn0.051 , and trgo 
 sample are shown in figure 1b , d , f and figure s1c in supporting information . 
 it can be seen that on increasing 
 the level of n - doping , the d - to - g band intensity ratio , id / ig , increased . 
 it is known 
 that if nitrogen enters the graphene lattice , the intensity of the 
 d - band , i d , in the raman spectrum of graphene 
 is enhanced due to defects that emerge upon incorporation of nitrogen 
 into the graphene structure . 
 this provides 
 further evidence that under the synthetic conditions used , accommodation 
 of nitrogen into the graphene lattice was strongly favored over a 
 simple adsorption / addition process . if defects are introduced 
 into graphene , paramagnetic centers emerge 
 that may interact via suitable mediators ( i.e. , -conduction 
 electrons , overlapping orbitals favoring superexchange mechanism , 
 etc . ) to generate long - range magnetic ordering in the 2d lattice . 
 under such conditions , the magnetic susceptibility of graphene ,  , 
 involves three contributions , i.e. ,  = dia + para + ferro , where dia is the diamagnetic term including orbital , landau and core 
 diamagnetic contributions , para is the paramagnetic 
 term including noninteracting ( isolated ) defect - induced paramagnetic 
 centers , pauli paramagnetic contribution from conduction electron 
 and van vleck contribution , and ferro is the fm 
 term describing the magnetic response of interacting defect - induced 
 paramagnetic centers . 
 as expected , pristine 
 trgo behaved in a diamagnetic manner with only a tiny paramagnetic 
 response at low temperatures ( see figure s1d in supporting information ) due to paramagnetic centers emerging 
 as a result of defects and/or the negligible content of oxygen functionalities , 
 which were most likely at the edges ; the profile of mass of trgo well matched the modified curie law , i.e. , mass = mass , dia + c / t , where mass , dia is the diamagnetic contribution , c is the curie constant , and t is the temperature . 
 similarly , the temperature evolution of mass measured 
 for the gn0.015 and gn0.033 sample also obeyed 
 the modified curie law ( see figure 4a , b ) . 
 the number of paramagnetic centers increased 
 upon increasing the level of n - doping , as expected and evidenced by 
 an enhanced paramagnetic curie contribution ( see insets in figure 4a , b ) . 
 however , n - doping 
 at such levels did not imprint any magnetic configuration ( as confirmed 
 by theoretical calculations discussed below ) and the induced paramagnetic 
 centers were far from each other , precluding the establishment of 
 a long - range magnetic ordering . thus , the gn0.015 and gn0.033 sample showed dominant diamagnetic behavior , as also 
 witnessed from the isothermal magnetization curves measured at 5 k 
 ( see insets in figure 4a , b ) . 
 temperature evolution of the mass magnetic susceptibility , mass , of the ( a ) gn0.015 and ( b ) gn0.033 sample recorded under an external magnetic field of 1 koe . 
 the insets 
 in panel ( a ) and ( b ) show the temperature profile of mass after subtraction of the diamagnetic component and behavior of the 
 5 k hysteresis loop of the gn0.015 and gn0.033 sample , respectively . 
 ( c ) temperature evolution of mass for the gn0.051 sample recorded under an external magnetic 
 field of 1 koe with the curie temperature , tc , indicated . 
 the insets show the trend of mass at low temperatures and the temperature profile of the fm contribution , 
 mass , ferro , derived from fitting the measured mass . 
 ( d ) hysteresis loop of the gn0.051 sample 
 measured at a temperature of 5 k. the insets show the behavior of 
 the hysteresis loop around the origin with the coercivity marked and 
 field - dependent profiles of magnetization for the ferromagnetic , mferro , and paramagnetic , mpara , component derived from fitting the measured isothermal 
 magnetization curve . 
 ( e ) scheme showing different magnetic fractions 
 in the gn0.051 sample and their respective profiles of 
 mass . 
 interestingly , for the gn0.051 sample , the temperature 
 profile of mass was drastically different compared 
 to the gn0.015 and gn0.033 sample as it could 
 not be described by the modified curie law . 
 on lowering the temperature , 
 mass showed a saturation tendency followed by an 
 abrupt increase , indicating two contributions , i.e. , fm and paramagnetic 
 ( see figure 4c  e ) ; 
 contrary to the graphene systems with a lower n - doping , the diamagnetic 
 term was found to be negligible here . 
 the presence of both magnetic 
 fractions can be explained by assuming that the n - doped graphene sheets 
 within the sample contained nitrogen in different structural configurations , 
 which have a different impact on the magnetism of graphene , as predicted 
 by the theory discussed below . 
 moreover , it is known that even in 
 sheets showing fm behavior , isolated paramagnetic centers may evolve 
 owing to the presence of vacancies and defects of topological and 
 edge nature . in order to fit the temperature evolution of mass 
 , the paramagnetic term was fitted using the curie function ( i.e. , 
 mass = c / t ) over 
 the whole temperature interval , whereas a model function involving 
 a combination of the curie 
 weiss law ( i.e. , mass = c/(t   ) , where 
  is the weiss temperature ) at high temperatures and brillouin 
 function within the mean - field approximation at low temperatures was 
 constructed to describe the fm contribution ( see inset in figure 4c ) . 
 the fitting yielded 
   69 k , angular momentum number j  
 1.19 , and a weight - normalized ratio of ferromagnetic - to - paramagnetic 
 contribution equal to 1.66 . note that the value of j is not an integral multiple of 0.5 as expected and must be treated 
 as an average over all the n - doped graphene sheets in the gn0.051 sample as the sheets can have different c  n configurations / arrangements 
 with different net magnetic moments ( see below ) , as already reported 
 for n - doped and s - doped graphene systems . 
 furthermore ,  can be assigned to the curie temperature , tc , marking the transition from the paramagnetic 
 to fm regime on lowering the temperature . 
 thus , in accordance with 
 the theory , if the concentration of nitrogen exceeds a threshold value 
 ( > 5 at . 
 % of n ) , magnetically active motifs inside the graphene 
 lattice 
 evolve , eventually leading to a magnetically ordered ( i.e. , fm ) state 
 at low temperatures . 
 % of n to the low - temperature 
 fm regime was further confirmed by a series of hysteresis loops measured 
 over the temperature range from 5 to 300 k ( see figure 4d and figure s5 in supporting information ) . at 5 
 k , the isothermal magnetization curve showed 
 hysteresis with a coercivity of 92 oe ( see inset in figure 4d ) and saturation 
 magnetization reaching 1.09 emu / g . the derived value of the saturation 
 magnetization is of identical order as reported for s - doped graphenes and vertical graphenes , which are regarded as the magnetically strongest carbon - based systems 
 prepared to date . 
 the nonzero value of the coercivity implies that 
 n - doping imprints magnetic anisotropy on the graphene lattice , establishing 
 an easy axis of magnetization along which the magnetic moments of 
 the generated paramagnetic centers energetically prefer to lie . 
 following 
 the mathematical procedures of liu et al . and tuek et al . and assuming 
 the j value and weighted ferromagnetic - to - paramagnetic 
 ratio derived from the mass vs t profile , we next attempted to separate the paramagnetic and fm contribution 
 in the 5 k isothermal magnetization curve ( see inset in figure 4d ) . 
 the fitting yielded a saturation 
 magnetization of 0.65 emu / g and 0.37 emu / g for the 
 fm and paramagnetic contributions , respectively . 
 on raising the temperature , 
 the coercivity decreased to zero ( see inset in figure s5b in supporting information ) and the hysteresis was 
 lost at a temperature of 70 k ( see figure s5a in supporting information ) , indicating a transition 
 from the fm to paramagnetic regime . 
 thus , the experimental results 
 suggested that when the concentration 
 of nitrogen was increased and it became firmly embedded in the crystal 
 lattice of graphene , the number of induced paramagnetic centers increased , 
 eventually forming magnetically active motifs with conduction electrons 
 providing interaction pathways between them and establishing long - range 
 magnetic ordering upon decreasing the temperature . it was hypothesized 
 that upon further increasing the nitrogen concentration in the graphene 
 lattice , magnetic interactions would be strengthened , as reflected 
 by a shift of tc to higher temperature . 
 moreover , the presence of more paramagnetic centers would enhance 
 the saturation magnetization , approaching the values observed for 
 s - doped and vertically oriented graphenes , i.e. , systems where the magnetic features are imprinted by defects . 
 here 
 % of n was probably a consequence of the different nitrogen motifs 
 identified in the samples by xps ( graphitic , pyridinic , and chemisorbed 
 importantly , we did not identify pyrrolic nitrogen 
 in the samples , which has previously been shown to cause a fall in 
 magnetization values . to decipher 
 the effect of nitrogen in various bonding configurations 
 ( as identified by xps , figure 2 and figure s3 in supporting information ) on the magnetic properties of graphene 
 , we performed a first - principles study of the structural , electronic , and magnetic properties of 
 n - doped graphenes . 
 the  magnetic contributions  of individual 
 n - motifs were also addressed in details . 
 we used a rectangular graphene 
 cell containing 96 atoms , which was computationally tractable and 
 enabled the experimentally determined total and relative ( among different 
 bonding configurations ) content of nitrogen to be followed closely . 
 specifically , we considered chemisorbed nitrogen ( both n and n2 ) on the top of the graphene sheet and two graphitic and pyridinic 
 nitrogen atoms in the graphene lattice ( see figure 5 ) . top view of graphene doped with graphitic ( in para configurations ) , trimerized pyridinic and chemisorbed

 ( b ) n2 marked respectively by red , green , and magenta , 
 with positive ( negative ) spin densities plotted in blue ( red ) for 
 isosurfaces at 1  10 ( panel ( a ) ) and 
 2.5  10e ( panel ( b ) ) . 
 ( c , d ) the corresponding dos plot for 
 configuration shown in panel ( a ) and panel ( b ) , respectively . 
 the computational data fully supported 
 the experimental results . 
 in particular , the energetically most stable structures , as presented 
 in figure 5a , 
 b , exhibited 
 fm ordering with 1.3 and 0.3 b magnetic moment per 
 supercell for n and n2 , respectively , chemisorbed on the 
 graphene surface . the density of state ( dos ) plots presented in figure 5c , d indicated exchange 
 coupling mediated by the conduction electrons . 
 moreover , the strong 
 spin - polarized electron features at the fermi level in the dos structures 
 showed a predominant contribution from the graphitic n atoms , which 
 highlights their important role in developing stoner - like magnetism 
 in n - doped graphenes . 
 it should be noted that depending 
 on the position of nitrogen on the graphene surface with respect to 
 the graphitic and pyridinic nitrogen atoms , a large number of possible 
 magnetic configurations were found with a varying effective magnetic 
 moment per cell and exhibiting both fm and antiferromagnetic behavior 
 or even disappearance of magnetic order . 
 this may explain the complexity 
 of the magnetic measurements discussed above for the gn0.051 sample , as the experimental response represented an average over 
 a large number of structures with different net magnetic moments . 
 thus , to understand the role and contribution of individual nitrogen 
 motifs in triggering magnetism in n - doped graphenes , we carried out 
 an extensive set of additional calculations with a smaller cell containing 
 48 atoms . 
 the magnetic properties of graphene doped with graphitic 
 nitrogen exhibited a strong dependence on both the nitrogen concentration 
 and configurations . 
 % of graphitic nitrogen ( the percentages used result 
 from the size of the cell employed in the calculations ) are shown 
 in figure s6 in supporting information . 
 the magnetism of graphene doped with graphitic nitrogen has been attributed 
 to delocalized electrons occupying narrow peaks at the fermi level 
 ( ef ) . 
 % of nitrogen was predicted to be nonmagnetic , in accord 
 with dft calculations by wang et al . , and 
 the narrow electron donor states near ef were absent in the partial density of states ( pdos ) . at 4.2 at . 
 % of nitrogen , the computational screening identified a magnetic structure 
 with a magnetic moment of 0.2 b per supercell 
 in which n atoms substituted c atoms at para positions 
 ( see figure 6 ) . 
 the 
 same motif was responsible for triggering ferromagnetism in the larger 
 96-atom cell , which highlights the importance of the graphitic nitrogen 
 motif in imprinting fm order in n - doped graphene . 
 n - doping generating 
 the fm state gave rise to a strong pz electron peak at the fermi level in the electronic 
 structure according to pdos , similar to recent reports for graphene 
 doped with 4.2 at . 
 the magnetic 
 polarization was confined to a narrow part of the cell , in zigzag 
 directions between the doping atoms , as can be seen in the inset in figure 6 presenting isosurfaces 
 of spin densities . 
 importantly , formation of zigzag edges by cutting 
 graphene along a certain crystallographic direction has been shown 
 to give rise to peculiar edge localized states near the fermi level 
 responsible for the spontaneous formation of magnetic ordering in 
 graphene nanoribbons . 
 partial densities of 
 states calculated for graphene doped with 
 nitrogen embedded in the lattice at para positions 
 at a concentration of 4.2 at . 
 the supercell is shown in the inset , 
 where an isosurface of spin - density plotted at 5  10e is also 
 displayed . 
 % of graphitic 
 nitrogen , a greater number of magnetic configurations with the magnetic 
 moment varying between 0.1 and 0.8 b / supercell ( see figure 7 and figure s7 in supporting information ) were produced . 
 these 
 magnetic structures contained two n atoms in the meta configuration embedded in the graphene lattice . 
 the magnetic behavior 
 of this system could be tuned by changing the position of the third 
 n atom in the host lattice as it stayed on the zigzag paths between 
 the other two n atoms . finally , because of the similar atomic sizes 
 of nitrogen and carbon atoms , incorporation of nitrogen into the honeycomb 
 network of graphene did not lead to any significant distortion of 
 the host lattice . in - plane 
 atomic displacements caused by nitrogen 
 were below 2% of the c  c distance of pristine graphene and 
 the system remained planar .

 of

 positive ( negative ) spin densities are plotted in blue 
 ( red ) for isosurfaces at 5  10e : ( a ) 0.1 , ( b ) 0.4 , ( c ) 0.7 , 
 ( d ) 0.8 , ( e ) 0.4 , and ( f ) 0.6 b per supercell . 
 we also considered the effect 
 of nitrogen atoms substituting carbons 
 in the graphene lattice ( employing a 48-atom graphene cell ) on pyrrolic 
 bonding sites . 
 a single pyrrolic nitrogen in graphene occupied a site 
 inside the pentagonal ring in the vicinity of single vacancy ( sv ) 
 or divacancy ( dv ) defect ( see figure s8a , b in supporting information ) . 
 substitution by monomeric pyrrolic 
 nitrogen did not result in any long - range magnetic order . 
 c 
 bond with an n atom led to opening of the 5-membered ring and s = 1/2 paramagnetism due to 
 the carbon dangling bond . 
 such a bonding configuration transformed 
 the initial pyrrolic nitrogen into pyridinic nitrogen ( see figure 
 s8c , d in supporting information ) . 
 we also 
 considered the effect of adding pyrrolic nitrogen inside the octagonal 
 ring of the dv defect ( figure s8e , f in supporting information ) , as proposed in the work of li et al . 
 the present calculations indicated that the 
 nitrogen atom moved to the neighboring 5-membered ring , in accord 
 with the study by lin et al . 
 , forming 
 a 6-membered ring upon relaxation in which nitrogen ( transformed into 
 pyridinic ) was nonmagnetic . 
 next , we considered the role of 
 pyridinic nitrogen , which was also 
 identified as an important motif in the experimental samples . 
 besides 
 monomeric pyridinic nitrogen ( s = 0 or s = 1/2 due to carbon dangling bonds ) , we also considered dimerized 
 ( with s = 1/2 magnetic moment due to carbon dangling 
 bond ) and trimerized pyridinic nitrogen ( with a magnetic moment of 
 0.3 b per supercell ) . note that the calculated ground 
 state arrangements of multiple pyridinic nitrogen in the graphene 
 lattice were in agreement with annular dark - field imaging reported 
 in the work by lin et al . however , according 
 to dos of the trimerized pyridinic nitrogen ( see figure s9 in supporting information ) , the electronic structure 
 indicated that indirect exchange mediated by the conduction electrons 
 was strongly compromised compared to the exchange coupling developed 
 for graphene doped with graphitic nitrogen ( compare figure 6 and figure s9 in supporting information ) . 
 this is in line with 
 the suppressed magnetic moment of trimerized pyridinic nitrogen in 
 comparison to that of trimerized graphitic nitrogen ( see the structure 
 presented in figure 7f and dos plot in figure s7f in supporting information ) . 
 it is also important to mention that half - metallic properties 
 were recently predicted for the graphene - based c4n3 polymer , i.e. , a 2d radical 
 polymer containing many trimerized pyridinic nitrogens . 
 in contrast , 
 the dos plot presented in figure s9 in supporting information showed finite ( nonzero ) density of states above ef in both spin - up and spin - down channel , which 
 is most likely due to a significantly lower concentration of trimerized 
 pyridinic nitrogen in the present study . 
 finally , we investigated 
 whether magnetism in graphene can also 
 be induced by nitrogen adatoms / molecule , which were identified in 
 the xps patterns and tga / ega measurements . 
 thus , structures resulting 
 from both nitrogen additions on a pristine graphene layer and simultaneous 
 single nitrogen atom addition and graphitic substitution were analyzed 
 ( see figure s10 and figure s11 in supporting information ) . 
 a single n - adatom carried a magnetic moment of 0.5 b , which can be understood based on an electron counting argument : 
 two valence electrons formed covalent bonds with neighboring c atoms , 
 two formed a lone - pair , and the fifth valence electron gave rise to 
 the magnetic moment . 
 another nitrogen atom contributed 0.5 b , 
 but no magnetic moments were induced on the c atoms . by placing another 
 nitrogen atom in a close proximity to the preadsorbed adatom , 
 an n2 dimer spontaneously formed , which was adsorbed over the surface 
 and had zero magnetic moment . 
 % of graphitic nitrogen ( see figure s11 in supporting information ) also did not induce a magnetic response 
 in the system . 
 to conclude , the computational study allowed 
 elucidation of the 
 synergistic effect of nitrogen atoms in various bonding configurations , 
 as evidenced from high - resolution xps data . to follow closely the 
 total and relative content of nitrogen in the experimentally prepared 
 samples 
 , we considered graphitic nitrogen in the para configuration , which turned out to promote formation of the motif 
 most important for imprinting magnetism in graphene , followed by trimerized 
 pyridinic nitrogen and chemisorbed n adatoms . in the ground state , 
 the structure resulting from the combined effects of all these species 
 is strongly fm . 
 however , it should be noted that coupling between 
 pyridinic nitrogens is much less effective in maintaining the fm structure , 
 and chemisorbed nitrogen adatoms can only generate paramagnetism . 
 finally , pyrrolic nitrogen has no effect on magnetism in graphene , 
 in line with the work by ito et al . , who 
 reported a decrease in the magnetization values with increasing concentration 
 of pyrrolic nitrogen in the graphene lattice . 
 in 
 summary , on the basis of electronic - structure calculations and 
 magnetization measurements , we have provided new insights into the 
 role of nitrogen as a highly electronegative n - type 
 dopant for imprinting the magnetic properties to graphene . 
 the magnetic 
 features of n - doped graphene depend on both the nitrogen concentration 
 and the configuration in the host lattice , with a complex interplay 
 between graphitic , pyridinic , and chemisorbed nitrogen . among these 
 structural motifs , 
 % of nitrogen , graphene behaves dominantly as a diamagnet ; paramagnetic 
 centers are induced upon doping ; however , they do not produce magnetically 
 active motifs . 
 if the doping concentration is increased above the 
 threshold doping value , magnetic interactions mediated by the conduction 
 electron system emerge between the substitution - generated paramagnetic 
 centers . 
 % shows a transition to an fm state at the curie 
 temperature of 69 k and saturation magnetization reaching 
 1.09 emu / g . 
 such a high value of the saturation magnetization ranks 
 n - doped graphenes among the magnetically strongest graphene - based 
 systems developed so far for which the magnetic properties are imprinted 
 by defects . as n - doping 
 is also expected to maintain or even improve 
 the electric ( i.e. , conduction ) features of graphene , the present 
 work opens possibilities for further optimization of n - doped graphenes 
 ( e.g. , exclusive presence of graphitic nitrogen ) to produce new kinds 
 of spintronic materials .","substitution carbon nitrogen atoms graphene lattice necessarily leads changes electronic density states graphitic nitrogen provide electrons close fermi level graphene

 possibilities for tailoring the electronic 
 properties and band gap of graphene toward its applications , e.g. , 
 in spintronics and optoelectronics . 
 one major obstacle is development 
 of magnetically active n - doped graphene with spin - polarized conductive 
 behavior . 
 however , the effect of nitrogen on the magnetic properties 
 of graphene has so far only been addressed theoretically , and triggering 
 of magnetism through n - doping has not yet been proved experimentally , 
 except for systems containing a high amount of oxygen and thus decreased 
 conductivity . here , we report the first example of ferromagnetic graphene 
 achieved by controlled doping with graphitic , pyridinic , and chemisorbed 
 nitrogen . 
 the magnetic properties were found to depend strongly on 
 both the nitrogen concentration and type of structural n - motifs generated 
 in the host lattice .

 nonmagnetic ; however , once doped at 5.1 at . 
 % of nitrogen , n - doped 
 graphene exhibited transition to a ferromagnetic state at 69 
 k and displayed a saturation magnetization reaching 1.09 emu / g . 
 theoretical 
 calculations were used to elucidate the effects of individual chemical 
 forms of nitrogen on magnetic properties . 
 results showed that magnetic 
 effects were triggered by graphitic nitrogen , whereas pyridinic and 
 chemisorbed nitrogen contributed much less to the overall ferromagnetic 
 ground state . 
 calculations further proved the existence of exchange

"olfactory neuroblastoma or esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of neuroectodermal origin arising from olfactory membrane of the sinonasal tract . 
 it was originally described in french literature by berger et al . in 1924 who coined the term 
 the various synonyms used for this entity are olfactory esthesio - neuroepithelioma , esthesio - neurocytoma , esthesio - neuroepithelioma , esthesio - neuroblastoma , olfactory neuroblastoma and olfactory placode tumor . the first case in american literature 
 this tumor has broad histologic spectrum and is often histologically confused with peripheral neural ectodermal tumors and is notorious for its wide clinical behaviors . 
 the common clinical symptoms include nasal obstruction , recurrent epistaxis , hyposomia , rhinorrhea , headache and visual disturbances . 
 here we report a rare case of esthesioneuroblastoma in a female with presenting symptom as tooth pain . 
 a 50-year - old female reported to the department of oral medicine with the complaint of pain in the left side of the upper jaw since seven months , which was spontaneous , dull and reduced on taking analgesics . 
 she visited a general dentist five months ago and maxillary left second molar was extracted as it was considered as the causative tooth for pain , however , the patient did not get relief and the pain continued . 
 she noticed swelling of left side of the face , which gradually increased in size and there was a concomitant decrease in size of her left eye opening and the eyeball was pushing superiorly since two months . 
 her medical and family history was noncontributory and upon general physical examination , all her vital signs were within normal limits . 
 on extraoral examination , a diffuse swelling was seen on the left maxillary area extending from infraorbital margin to mid of the cheek supero - inferiorly and ala of nose to outer canthus of eye antero - posteriorly , which was soft in consistency and tender on palpation [ figure 1a ] . 
 intraorally , swelling was evident on palpation extending from maxillary tuberosity to the vestibule causing vestibular obliteration till the posterior aspect , which was tender and soft in consistency on palpation [ figure 1b ] . clinical photograph showing swelling on maxillary region and decrease in the size of the left eye ( a ) . 
 intraorally , vestibular obliteration was evident ( b ) on the basis of history and clinical examination , a provisional diagnosis of malignant neoplasm of maxillary sinus was considered . 
 the coronal ct revealed a large mass originating in left maxillary sinus with destruction of its medial , superior and postero - lateral wall . 
 medially , this mass was extending into left nasal fossa leading to marked luminal compromise on the left side and superiorly extension into left orbit was noticed . 
 posteriorly it was extending into infra - temporal fossa , left masseteric space and left pterygomaxillary fissure . 
 partial erosion of anterior maxillary wall , hard palate and lateral pterygoid plate on left side and extension of this mass from lateral maxillary wall into left cheek was also noticed [ figure 2a and b ] . 
 coronal computed tomographic scan showing extension of lesion into sinus and nasal fossa incisional biopsy was performed and on histopathological examination , hematoxylin and eosin stain showed basophilic cells arranged in large lobar sheets with intertwining connective tissue septa . 
 cells had large round nucleus with minimal pleomorphism and a thin rim of cytoplasm . pronounced vascularity and formation of pseudorosettes ( homer - wright type ) were seen in some areas , suggestive of esthesioneuroblastoma [ figure 3a and b ] . 
 immunohistochemistry revealed strongly positive neuron - specific enolase among the tumor cells and s-100 showed weak association [ figure 4a and b ] . 
 so based on clinical examination and the investigations performed , a final diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma was given . 
 the case was referred to the oncology institute for the management and the patient was started with chemotherapy , cisplatin 50 mg ( per day ) and 5 fluorouracil 1 mg ( per day ) , and recalled after 15 days ; there was improvement in the symptoms after which the patient was lost to follow up .

 esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare malignant tumor arising from olfactory epithelium and its neural origin was established by trojanowaski et al . in 1982 who demonstrated the presence of neurofilament proteins ( nfp ) in the tumor cells . 
 though , it has been reported in patients as young as two years to 90 years , a bimodal age distribution has been noted in the second and sixth decades of life . 
 there are no known etiologic agents for human olfactory neuroblastoma , however , injection of diethylnitrosamine in syrian hamsters and n - nitrosopiperidine in rats has produced tumors histologically identical to human olfactory neuroblastoma . 
 the common symptoms associated are unilateral nasal obstruction ( 70% ) and epistaxis ( 46% ) , and less common manifestations are anosmia , headache , pain , excessive lacrimation and ocular disturbances . in the present case , 
 the patient complained of pain in left maxillary molar teeth , which is a rare symptom and also , there was decrease in size of left eye , which may be due to superior extension of tumor in the left orbit . 
 the most common site of origin is in the upper nasal cavity in the region of the cribriform plate ; other primary sites such as maxillary sinus and nasopharynx have also been reported . 
 esthesioneuroblastoma is generally believed to be derived from the neurosensory receptor cells of olfactory mucosa . 
 other sources of origin suggested include sphenopalatine ganglion by escat , organ of jacobson , ganglion of luci by martin et al . and olfactory placode . 
 the tumor in the present case was seen to arise from left maxillary sinus and extended to involve nasal fossa , infra - temporal fossa , masseteric space , cheek and the left orbit . 
 according to this classification , stage a tumors are confined to the nasal cavity , stage b tumors have paranasal sinus extension and stage c tumors have extra - paranasal extension including the involvement of the cribriform plate , base of skull , orbit or intracranial cavity . 
 this classification was modified by morita et al . in 1993 who established stage d in the classification for tumors with metastasis to cervical lymph nodes or distant site . 
 kadish 's classification has been used by various authors and appears to correlate well with the clinical outcome . 
 the present case can be categorized as belonging to stage c of kadish 's classification . in evaluation of esthesioneuroblastoma , 
 the extent of disease is best determined by pre- and post - contrast mr imaging in which there is intense signal in t2-weighted images with marked enhancement of t1-weighted images after gadolinium injection . 
 details of bone erosion ( lamina papyracea , cribriform plate and fovea ethmoidalis ) are better demonstrated by ct scan . 
 tumor is presented as homogenous density mass , equal or greater to the surrounding soft tissue and no tumor cysts or calcifications . 
 coronal images were of value in evaluating extension to the orbit and through the cribriform plate and the anterior cranial fossa . 
 ( 2001 ) demonstrated the usefulness of technetinium-99m - ethyl cysteinate dimer ( tc - ecd ) spect in detection of olfactory neuroblastoma . 
 ( 1960 ) stated that the characteristic histologic features of olfactory neuroblastoma are plexiform intercellular fibrils , round - to - oval - shaped nuclei with scanty cytoplasm , distinct and sharply defined chromatin , which may be coarse or fine , compartmentation of sheets of neoplastic cells into lobules by slender vascular fibrous septa , true neural rosettes ( flexner - wintersteiner type ) and pseudorosettes ( homer - wright type ) . 
 they concluded that if fibrils were absent , then the tumor can not be classified as neuroblastoma with certainity . 
 histologically neuroblastoma has been classified as olfactory neurocytoma ( pattern i of mendeloff ) , a tumor with a sheet of round small cells separated by connective tissue septa and occasionally pseudorosettes ; olfactory neuroepithelioma ( pattern ii of mendeloff ) , a tumor containing round to oval nuclei clear nuclear membrane , scant cytoplasm and rosettes ; and a tumor similar to neuroblastomas found elsewhere in the body . 
 immunologically , it is most reactive with neuron - specific enolase ( nse ) as seen in the reported case . 
 it has shown reactivity with s-100 , synaptophysin , nfp , class iii beta - tubulin and microtubule - associated protein . 
 light microscopy can usually establish the diagnosis , but highly undifferentiated tumors make this difficult . in case when light microscopy fails to establish diagnosis , electron microscopy is helpful . 
 esthesioneuroblastoma must be distinguished from lymphosarcoma , transitional cell carcinoma , plasmacytoma , reticulum cell carcinoma , small cell undifferentiated carcinoma and ewing 's sarcoma . 
 small cell carcinoma typically is a submucosal hypercellular proliferation growing in sheets , cords and ribbons ; the distinct lobular pattern of olfactory neuroblastoma is absent . 
 the cells are small and hyperchromatic with oval- to spindle - shaped nuclei , absent nucleoli and minimal cytoplasm . 
 although uncommon , neural - type rosettes similar to those seen in olfactory neuroblastoma can be seen in association with small cell carcinoma . 
 in contrast to olfactory neuroblastoma , nse reactivity in small cell carcinoma is more likely to be focal than diffusely positive and the s-100 protein staining , if present , is dispersed throughout the cellular proliferation and not limited to sustentacular cells . 
 ewing 's sarcoma is composed of solid sheets or masses of solid round cells with very little stroma , scanty cytoplasm and ovoid large nuclei ; necrosis is common . 
 the characteristic cells of plasmacytoma and so - called cylinders in cylindromas readily help in identifying these tumors . 
 small cell undifferentiated carcinomas does not contain fibrils and the distinct cytoplasmic borders can be seen . 
 the current accepted standard of treatment is craniofacial resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to a dose of 55 - 65 gy for kadish stages b and c. small kadish stage a disease is treated by surgery alone in some situations by some groups , but most suggest adjuvant radiotherapy for these lesions also . 
 neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been used in advanced disease and where complete resection is not possible , with cyclophosphamide , vincristine ifosphamide , etoposide and cisplatin combined with preoperative radiotherapy . 
 the overall five , 10 and 15-year survival rates have been reported to be 78% , 71% and 68% , respectively . 
 initial multimodality therapy is associated with five - year survival of 80% for low - grade tumors and 40% for high - grade tumors . 
 the most hazardous and often fatal complication is intracranial extension of tumor through destruction of cribriform plate and orbital plates and secondly due to distant metastasis . 
 prognosis has been correlated to clinical staging with five - year survival of 75 - 91% , 68 - 71% and 41 - 47% for stages 
 other factors that have been implicated in prognosis include histologic grading , proliferation rate and ploidy . 
 histologically lower grade tumors ( grades i and ii ) have been reported to have a better five - year survival than higher grade tumors ( grades iii and iv ) . 
 the tumor metastasizes widely by both hematogenous and lymphatic routes , approximately 10 - 60% will experience distant metastasis . 
 the most common site for metastasis spread are cervical lymph nodes , and less frequent are lungs , brain , bone , spinal column , breast and abdominal viscera . 
 metastasis to the central nervous system is infrequent and in spinal cord 80% of metastasis is in cauda equine . 
 , this tumor has been difficult to recognize and diagnose pathologically and the wide spectrum of presentation of this tumor has resulted in its frequent misdiagnosis . 
 thus , the diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma demands a specialized and experienced head and neck pathologist , especially as incidence rate is low . also , esthesioneuroblastoma may present , only as tooth pain as in the present case . 
 so , it may be considered as a possible differential diagnosis , though rare in cases of dento - facial pain of idiopathic cause .","medially mass extending left nasal fossa leading marked luminal compromise left side superiorly extension left orbit noticed

"malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors ( mpnst ) , which are comprised of 5 to 10% of all soft - tissue sarcoma , often occur in the near proximal extremity at a nerve trunk such as sciatic nerve , brachial plexus , or sacral plexus .

 the primary minst is termed as a result of their histological and immunohistochemical similarities to mpnst but is distinguished by their intracerebral location1 ) . 
 minst is a preferable term to indicate malignant intracerebral schwannoma or neurofibrosarcoma , since these tumors have the appearance of any nerve sheath cells , including schwann cells , perineural fibroblasts , or fibroblasts8,10 ) . 
 neither our case nor the other previously - published case reports could make an accurate diagnosis before pathologic findings . in imaging studies such as brain computed tomography and mri , it is difficult to discriminate between minst and high grade glioma , because those tumors were intra - axial , homogeneously enhancing and had surrounding edema11 ) . 
 it is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of minst by looking ordinary hematoxylin and eosin - stained sections alone . 
 the differential diagnosis of these tumors includes malignant melanomas with schwann - type differentiation , mixed gliomas with mesenchymal differentiation , intracerebral rhabomyosarcomas , desmoplastic infantile ganglioma , intracerebral meningioma , and solitary fibrous tumor2,16 ) . 
 however , immunohistochemical analysis has special value both in verifying nerve sheath derivation and malignancy16 ) . 
 positive s-100 protein may help in differentiating the nerve sheath tumors from the other soft tissue tumors6 ) . 
 the absence of gfap expression in tumor cells ruled out desmoplastic astrocytoma , gliofibroma , and gliosarcoma , whereas the absence of synaptophysin and neurofilament protein excluded desmoplastic ganglioglioma12 ) . in the reported cases , 
 the prognosis of minst is poor2 ) . according to the data in table 1 , survival time was longer when the tumor recurrence was slower . 
 the recurrence free survival after the initial resection appears an important predictor of the overall survival12 ) . in cases of bruner 
 et al.4 ) , barnard et al.1 ) , and this case which reported long - term survival , the mitotic activity was rare or moderate rather than high . 
 it seems that if the mitotic activity is low , the recurrence rate is also low and thus the survival time will increase , although we could not take into account of various factors due to insufficient data caused by few number of reports have been produced to date . 
 a longer survival time was reported when total resection rather than subtotal resection was carried out3,7,16 ) . 
 it was considered that radiotherapy contributed to playing a limited role in the management of tumor in the early literature14,15 ) . 
 however , in the recent literature , radiotherapy showed possible effects on the local control and recurrence2,5 ) , but little on the overall survival in patients with minst1,16 ) . in case of beauchesne 
 et al.2 ) , systemic chemotherapy with doxorubicin ( 3 courses every month ) was prescribed , with mild benefit for the patient . 
 however , because of the rarity of this tumor type , there are still few reports published and little available information about the chemotherapy8 ) . in this case 
 , the kspno - so81 protocol was applied , which is one of protocols to treat a pediatric high grade brain tumor such as medulloblastoma and primitive neuroectodermal tumor . 
 although appropriate regimen of radiation therapy and chemotherapy are not determined yet2,5,15 ) , it is considered to be useful for the long - term survival of the patient to carry out a surgery , adjuvant radiation , and chemotherapy , as shown in this case . 
 different from the previous cases , this is the first case that had no evidence of tumor recurrence for 50 months after first surgery , and showed long - term survival for more than 77 months without showing no evidence of tumor recurrence . 
 although a definitive therapeutic regimen for minst has not yet been established due to the limited number of reported cases , a gtr followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be recommended to patients of minst .","brain mri follow examination performed every six months evidence tumor recurrence

"ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large intestine . its exact cause is unknown , but it appears to be multifactorial , with a proposed interaction between genetic and environmental factors that results in continuous activation of the intestinal mucosal immune system . 
 the inflammation affects the mucosa of the rectum , with different degrees of involvement of the colon.1 the management of ulcerative colitis is based on the extent of colon involvement , the activity , and the behavior of disease . 
 the classification of the disease is defined according to the montreal classification , which describes the maximal macroscopic extent of the disease at colonscopy.2 this has important prognostic and management implications because patients with extensive ulcerative colitis bear a higher risk of colectomy and cancer,3 and patients with proctitis and left - sided colitis obtain much more benefit from topical therapies . 
 however , the extent of colon involvement may change over time , such that about 20% of patients who are diagnosed with proctitis or left - sided ulcerative colitis are found to have proximal extension of the inflammation at follow - up . 
 the clinical course of ulcerative colitis is characterized by different disease onsets and a remitting 
 a recent population - based , inception cohort study identified four different patterns : ( 1 ) initial high activity that decreases to remission or mild severity ( 55% of patients ) ; ( 2 ) initial low activity that changes to increased severity ( 1% of patients ) ; ( 3 ) continuous symptoms ( 6% of patients ) ; and ( 4 ) chronic intermittent symptoms ( 37% of patients ) . 
 moreover , an initial presentation with extensive colitis , high systemic inflammation burden , and a younger age has been associated with higher subsequent colectomy rates.4 disease activity is commonly classified as : remission , mild , moderate , or severe . over the years , several different scoring systems have been developed as measures of disease activity , but most of these have only been used in clinical trials and have not been validated . in clinical practice , the combination of clinical features , laboratory findings , and the endoscopic appearance , forms the basis of patient management.5 
 the main treatment goals for ulcerative colitis are the induction and maintenance of clinical and endoscopic remission . as far as mild - to - moderate disease is concerned , 
 the oral and topical aminosalicylates represent the standard therapy for achieving this outcome.6 in the event of inadequate response to aminosalicylates and in patients with moderate - to - severe disease , systemic corticosteroids are the best option for inducing remission.7 patients with active ulcerative colitis who do not have significant clinical improvement after 24 weeks of an appropriate course of corticosteroids are classified as  corticosteroid - refractory . 
 anti - tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf ) monoclonal antibodies represent the best available option for this group of patients , achieving clinical and endoscopic remission without prolonged steroid exposure.8 after achieving a response with corticosteroid treatment , aminosalicylates are usually continued as maintenance therapy . 
 however , patients relapsing within 3 months of stopping corticosteroids or who are not able to reduce the dose to below 10 mg / day of prednisolone within 3 months of starting are classified as 
 corticosteroid dependent.1 in this specific disease setting , azathioprine has been shown to be significantly more effective than mesalazine for inducing corticosteroid - free clinical and endoscopic remission at 6 months and has a corticosteroid - sparing effect.9 treatment algorithms for patients with corticosteroid - dependent ulcerative colitis suggest starting concomitant thiopurine therapy and slowly withdrawing corticosteroids over 34 months , timed to coincide with the expected onset of action of the thiopurines.10 if symptoms persist or patients are unable to stop steroids after 12 weeks of starting thiopurines , anti - tnf agents should be started.10 finally , induction and scheduled maintenance treatment with infliximab has been recently reported to be effective for inducing steroid - free clinical remission and mucosal healing at 1 year , in both thiopurine - nave and experienced , corticosteroid - dependent , ulcerative colitis patients.11 patients with acute , severe ulcerative colitis need to be hospitalized and treated with intensive intravenous corticosteroids ( methylprednisolone , 60 mg/24 h , or hydrocortisone , 100 mg , four times daily ) . a lack of improvement within 35 days of intensive treatment is an indication for rescue therapy or surgery . a recent open - label trial involving 115 patients with acute , severe ulcerative colitis who were refractory to intravenous corticosteroids and randomized to receive either intravenous cyclosporine or infliximab has shown no significant differences in treatment failure ( primary efficacy outcome : 60% cyclosporine group vs 54% infliximab group ; absolute risk difference , 6% ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 7 to 19 [ p = 0.52]).12 therefore , the decisions of physicians are often determined on a case - by - case basis . 
 these decisions are usually made based on personal experiences with this specific therapy and the physician s confidence for the management of adverse events , taking into account the long - term strategy . 
 cyclosporine , in fact , has been shown to be effective only over the short - to - medium term . 
 therefore , all patients should be bridged to thiopurines , although it has been shown that patients without previous thiopurine exposure have better outcomes.13 
 adalimumab is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin ( ig ) g1 antibody to tnf that is subcutaneously administered at a standard induction dose of 160 mg , followed by 80 mg after 2 weeks . 
 maintenance doses are then scheduled at 40 mg every other week ( eow).14 this drug has been shown to be effective for inducing and maintaining remission in patients with active , moderate - to - severe luminal or perianal crohn s disease ; patients nave to anti - tnf ; or patients with previous loss of response or intolerance to infliximab.1519 as far as ulcerative colitis is concerned after the publication of the results of the two pivotal , randomized placebo - controlled double - blind trials ( ultra 1 and 2 ) ( table 1),20,21 adalimumab was approved for use in patients with moderate - to - severe active disease and in those who were nonresponders or intolerant to conventional therapy . in these trials , involving more than 1000 patients with moderate - to - severe active ulcerative colitis , adalimumab was compared with placebo with regard to the efficacy of induction and as a maintenance treatment , assessed after 8 and 52 weeks , respectively . in the ultra 1 trial,20 patients with ulcerative colitis were initially randomized to adalimumab ( 160 mg/80 mg ) or placebo at weeks 0 and 2 , respectively . 
 subsequently , after an amendment of the protocol , a third arm , with adalimumab at 80 mg/40 mg , was included . 
 all patients enrolled were nave to anti - tnf therapy and had active disease ( defined by a full mayo score of 612 and an endoscopic subscore of 23 ) , despite stable doses of concomitant steroids , immunomodulators , or both . 
 the primary endpoint , assessed in 390 patients with ulcerative colitis who were studied after the above amendment , was defined as the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission ( full mayo score  2 , with no individual subscore > 1 ) by week 8 in each treatment arm . 
 week 8 clinical remission was achieved in 18.5% of patients in the adalimumab 160/80 mg group and in 9.2% of patients in the placebo arm ( p = 0.031 ) , showing a 9.3% of therapeutic gain . 
 the week 8 clinical remission rate in the adalimumab 80/40 mg group was similar to that of the placebo group ( 10% vs 9.2% ) ( p = 0.833 ) . 
 the clinical response and mucosal healing among the three groups ( secondary endpoints ) were not significantly different . 
 a post hoc analysis identified baseline clinical variables , such as extensive disease , high disease activity ( mayo score  10 ) and high levels of systemic inflammation ( c - reactive protein = 10 mg / l ) , that were associated with a low proportion of patients in clinical remission , which might reflect a lesser efficacy of adalimumab in patients with more severe disease . thereafter , 390 patients entered an open - label extension study after week 8 and were maintained on adalimumab 40 mg eow for 52 weeks , with the possibility of dose - escalation to 40 mg weekly . 
 a clinical remission at week 52 was reported in 25.6% of patients maintained with 40 mg of adalimumab eow . a post hoc analysis , which included the patients who dose - escalated to 40 mg weekly , showed that 29.5% of patients were in remission at week 52.22 in the ultra 2 trial , 494 active ulcerative colitis patients were randomized to receive adalimumab 160 mg at week 0 , 80 mg at week 2 , and 40 mg eow , or placebo , through to 52 weeks . 
 the clinical and endoscopic eligibility characteristics were similar to those associated with the ultra 1 study , with the exception of the inclusion of ulcerative colitis patients ( 40% of the population studied ) who had already experienced anti - tnf agents , but with a discontinuation period of at least 8 weeks . 
 the two co - primary endpoints were defined as the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission ( defined as full mayo score  2 , with no individual subscore > 1 ) at week 8 and the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission at week 52 . 
 clinical remission at week 8 was achieved in 16.5% of patients in the adalimumab arm and in 9.3% of patients in the placebo arm ( p = 0.019 ) ( 7.2% therapeutic gain ) . 
 the corresponding values at week 52 were 17.3% and 8.5% ( p = 0.004 ) , respectively , with an absolute difference of adalimumab versus placebo of 8.8% . 
 moreover , a clinical response was achieved in 50.4% of patients receiving adalimumab and 34.6% on placebo ( p 
 < 0.001 ) at week 8 and in 30.2% and 18.3% , respectively ( p = 0.002 ) at week 52 . 
 the benefit over placebo was also significant by endoscopic remission , evaluated at week 8 ( 41.1% , adalimumab vs 31.7% , placebo ) ( p = 0.032 ) and at week 52 ( 25% vs 15.4% , respectively ) ( p = 0.009 ) . 
 a subgroup analysis , stratifying patients based on prior exposure to anti - tnf , was also performed . among nave patients , a week 8 clinical remission was achieved in 21.3% of patients in the adalimumab group and in 11% in the placebo group ( p = 0.017 ) ; the corresponding values at week 52 were 22% and 12.4% , respectively ( p = 0.029 ) . 
 a significant difference in clinical remission was found only at week 52 ( 10.2% , adalimumab and 3% , placebo ) ( p = 0.039 ) in the anti - tnf-exposed group.21 a post hoc intention - to - treat analysis of ultra 2 , including all patients randomized to adalimumab who achieved a clinical response , as per their partial mayo score at week 8 , was performed to investigate week 52 clinical remission , response , mucosal healing , corticosteroid - free remission , and corticosteroid discontinuation rates . among the 248 patients originally randomized to adalimumab , 123 ( 49.6% ) had achieved clinical response . of these , 30.9% , 49.6% , and 43.1% achieved clinical remission , clinical response , and mucosal healing at week 52 , respectively . 
 of the 150 adalimumab - treated patients taking corticosteroids at enrollment , 90 ( 60% ) responded , as per their partial mayo score at week 8 . 
 of these , 21.1% achieved corticosteroid - free remission and 37.8% were corticosteroid - free at week 52 , without significant differences among the anti - tnf-nave and exposed patients . 
 these results were similar whether or not week 8 responses were assessed using the full mayo score.23 further analysis showed that patients who received the 160 mg/80 mg adalimumab induction dose had a significantly lower risk of all - cause hospitalizations and ulcerative colitis - related hospitalizations , compared with placebo , during the first 8 weeks of therapy.24 this benefit over placebo was also significant for adalimumab early - responders , during the follow - up.25 at 52 weeks , 588 patients who completed the ultra 12 trials entered an extension , open - label study . 
 patients who entered the open - label , weekly adalimumab study continued at the same dose . 
 patients who entered the study from any blinded arm or from an open - label cohort receiving adalimumab ( 40 mg eow ) received adalimumab at a dose of 40 mg eow . at week 60 of the open - label extension study , 351 ( 59.7% ) of the patients who had entered the extension study achieved clinical remission , per their partial mayo score.26 
 although adalimumab has been recently licensed , multiple lines of evidence from open - label and retrospective studies on adalimumab , administered for compassionate use in ulcerative colitis patients , have been available for several years ( table 1 ) . 
 oussalah et al27 first presented data on 13 ulcerative colitis patients treated with adalimumab in 2008 . 
 all of the patients had been previously treated with infliximab , and most of them ( 90.31% ) had been previously treated with thiopurines . 
 patients were treated with adalimumab , with an induction dose of 160/80 mg at weeks 0 and 2 , and then maintained with 40 mg eow . 
 the primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients on adalimumab therapy during the study . after a median follow - up of 41 weeks 
 eight patients discontinued adalimumab : six due to colectomy , one due to lack of response , and one due to an exacerbation of psoriasis . 
 no significant differences were found in adalimumab withdrawal and colectomy rates between the patients who lost response to infliximab and those who became intolerant . from this small cohort of difficult - to - treat patients who had already been treated with all of the main available therapies , adalimumab treatment potentially avoided colectomy in about half of them . 
 one year later , the mayo clinic group published the results of an uncontrolled , open - label study on adalimumab in 20 patients with ulcerative colitis , of whom 35% were nave to infliximab . 
 all patients had active disease ( defined as a mayo score of 612 points , with an endoscopic subscore of at least 2 ) despite concurrent treatment ( steroids , and/or thiopurines , and/or aminosalicylates ) . 
 patients were treated with adalimumab at an induction dose of 160/80 mg at weeks 0 and 2 , respectively , and maintained with 40 mg eow . 
 the primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients achieving a clinical response at week 8 . 
 the percentages of patients who had a clinical remission or response were 5% and 25% at week 8 , respectively and 25% and 50% at week 24 , respectively . 
 no significant differences were found between infliximab - nave and infliximab - exposed patients . among the patients who entered the trial on corticosteroids , 58% were able to withdraw by week 24 , showing the potential effectiveness of adalimumab as a steroid - sparing agent.28 hudis 
 et al29 retrospectively reported data on nine patients , with active ulcerative colitis ( mean mayo score of 6  1.66 at baseline ) and secondary infliximab failure , who were treated with adalimumab ( induction , 160/80 mg at weeks 0/2 ; maintenance , 40 mg eow ) . during the follow - up 
 , adalimumab was found to be effective at inducing a clinical response ( mean mayo score , 2.5  1 ) ( p < 0.0005 ) , with a steroid - sparing effect ( p < 0.003 ) . 
 data , from a single referral center , involving 53 ulcerative colitis outpatients treated with biologic drugs , following a structured protocol for a  step - up  approach . 
 all patients were intolerant and/or nonresponders to conventional therapy , including aminosalicylates , steroids , and thiopurines . among them , 25 patients were treated with adalimumab ( 160/80 mg at weeks 0 and 2 , then 40 mg eow ) and 28 with infliximab ( 5 mg / kg at weeks 0 , 2 , and 6 , then every 8 weeks ) . 
 most of patients had extensive colitis ( 96% in the adalimumab group and 90% in the infliximab group ) . 
 concomitant immunosuppressive therapy ( azathioprine or methotrexate ) was taken by significantly fewer patients in the adalimumab group ( 20% vs 53.4% ) ( p = 0.0118 ) . 
 the primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients treated with adalimumab or infliximab achieving and maintaining a clinical response . at 14 weeks , 47 of the 53 ( 88.7% ) patients had a clinical response to anti - tnf therapy , without a significant difference between the adalimumab ( 20/25 patients , 80% ) and infliximab ( 27/28 patients , 96% ) groups ( p = 0.0889 ) . among the patients who entered the maintenance treatment phase , 1420 adalimumab ( 70.0% ) and 1418 ( 77.8% ) infliximab patients had a response up to the end of follow - up ( p = 0.7190 ) . 
 the median duration for the maintenance phase was 54.5 weeks ( range , 3108 weeks ) for the adalimumab group and 64.5 weeks ( range , 8180 weeks ) for the infliximab group . 
 of the six adalimumab patients who lost response , two underwent colectomy , one switched to infliximab , and three were treated with another course of steroids . 
 about 92% of the patients who were initially taking steroids were able to stop over the course of the maintenance period , with similar results observed in both groups . 
 cohort , adalimumab seemed to be as effective as infliximab at achieving induction and maintenance responses in ulcerative colitis patients . 
 the effectiveness of adalimumab in a real - life setting has also been reported in a spanish retrospective multicenter study that enrolled 30 ulcerative colitis patients after the failure of other therapies . 
 all patients were infliximab experienced : 53.3% had lost responsiveness , 40% had become intolerant , and 6.7% were primary nonresponders . 
 adalimumab was administered to 26 patients because of moderate - to - severe , refractory ulcerative colitis , and four patients received adalimumab because of a severe attack that was refractory to intravenous corticosteroids . 
 all patients received a loading dose of 160/80 mg of adalimumab at weeks 0 and 2 , respectively and were maintained with 40 mg eow . 
 patients were assessed at weeks 4 and 12 , and then every 4 weeks in order to evaluate the short- and long - term outcomes . 
 the primary endpoint was defined as the induction of a clinical response at week 12 . 
 sixteen ( 53.3% ) and 18 ( 60% ) patients achieved a clinical response at week 4 and 12 , respectively . 
 three ( 10% ) and eight ( 26.7% ) patients achieved a clinical remission at week 4 and 12 , respectively . fifteen ( 50% ) patients discontinued adalimumab during the median follow - up of 48 weeks ( interquartile range [ iqr ] , 16104 ) , and 13 ( 86.6% ) of them discontinued because of a lack or loss of response , including four inpatients with severe intravenous corticosteroid - refractory disease . 
 all patients who were under corticosteroid treatment at baseline and entered the maintenance adalimumab treatment were able to discontinue the steroids . 
 the rate of colectomy was 20% , with a median time to colectomy of 16 weeks ( iqr , 5.240.5 weeks ) . 
 a lack of response at week 12 was associated with an increased probability of withdrawal ( p = 0.001 ) and a higher rate of colectomy ( p = 0.001 ) . 
 thus , adalimumab induced a durable clinical response in a good percentage of patients with medically refractory ulcerative colitis , especially in those who achieved short - term clinical response.31 the same issue was also addressed by mcdermott et al,32 who collected data on 23 patients with ulcerative colitis treated with adalimumab ( standard induction and maintenance treatment ) . 
 twenty - two of the patients ( 96% ) had received prior immunomodulatory therapy and 20 ( 86% ) had previously been treated with infliximab ( three primary nonresponders , eleven secondary failures , and six who experienced side effects ) . 
 the primary endpoint was defined as treatment failure . during a median follow - up period of 22 months ( iqr , 832 months ) , 16 patients ( 69.5% ) discontinued adalimumab . 
 the reasons for discontinuation were primary nonresponse in six patients ( 37% ) , secondary nonresponse in eight ( 50% ) , and side effects in one ( 6% ) . 
 nine patients underwent colectomy , and three refused surgery ; the colectomy - free survival was estimated to be 78% at 6 months , 70% at 12 months , and 59% at 2 years . 
 no significant predictors of colectomy were identified , but 55% of patients who underwent surgery had failed adalimumab treatment within 3 months of starting treatment.32 further findings by ferrante et al33 confirmed that adalimumab is effective in inducing a durable clinical remission in patients who have already been treated with infliximab . 
 fifty patients with moderate - to - severe ulcerative colitis received adalimumab induction treatment ( 160/80 mg at weeks 0 and 2 , followed by 40 mg eow ) . 
 the primary endpoint was the long - term efficacy of adalimumab . at week 4 , 68% patients showed a short - term clinical response . 
 in particular , 22% of the patients achieved a complete clinical response , defined as the absence of diarrhea and bloody stools , and 46% of the patients achieved a partial response , defined as a marked clinical improvement , with persisting rectal blood loss . 
 after a median follow - up of 23 months , 52% achieved a durable response to adalimumab , defined as a lasting clinical response . 
 dose escalation was necessary in 76% of patients and was associated with significantly increased serum adalimumab levels ( from 4.75 to 7.95 g / ml ) ( p = 0.023 ) . 
 short - term clinical response and response to dose escalation were associated with colectomy - free survival ( p = 0.030 and p < 0.001 , respectively ) . 
 data from the spanish eneida ( estudio nacional en enfermedad inflamatoria intestinal sobre determinantes genticos y ambientales ) registry of 48 patients with ulcerative colitis treated with adalimumab ( induction dose , 160/80 mg at weeks 0 and 2 , in 93.7% of patients ; maintenance dose , 40 mg eow ) have been recently reported.31 among these patients , 39 ( 81.3% ) had previously received infliximab and were categorized into one of three categories : remission , 51.3% ; response , 33.3% ; and primary nonresponse , 15.4% . 
 the primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of patients achieving a clinical response during the follow - up period . 
 the clinical response rates were assessed at weeks 12 , 28 , and 54 and were 70.8% ( 34/48 ) , 43.2% ( 19/44 ) , and 35% ( 14/40 ) , respectively . 
 a response to prior treatment with infliximab was the only factor predictive of a response to adalimumab at week 12 , which was obtained in 90% of infliximab remitters , 53.8% of responders , and 33.3% of primary nonresponders 
 a lack of response to adalimumab at week 12 was shown to be an independent predictor of colectomy : five of the 34 ( 14.7% ) responders and six of the 14 ( 42.9% ) nonresponders ( p = 0.035 ) required a colectomy , with a colectomy - free time that was significantly reduced among the nonresponding patients ( p = 0.01).34 the last real - life experience comes from an italian multicenter study that represents the largest case series of active ulcerative colitis treated with adalimumab . 
 eighty - eight patients were treated with adalimumab ( induction dose of 160 mg/80 mg in 77 patients [ 87.5% ] and 80 mg/40 mg in eleven patients [ 12.5% ] , at weeks 0 and 2 , respectively ) . 
 after induction , the patients were maintained with adalimumab 40 mg eow ; a dose escalation was allowed at the physician s discretion . 
 all patients had active disease ( medium partial mayo score , 6 ) ( iqr , 48 ) , and 57 ( 64.8% ) had extensive colitis . 
 sixty - nine patients ( 78.4% ) had been previously treated with infliximab , and 65 ( 73.9% ) had been exposed to immunomodulators ( azathioprine , methotrexate , and cyclosporine ) . 
 the indications for adalimumab treatment were corticosteroid dependence in 41 patients ( 46.6% ) , corticosteroid resistance in 23 patients ( 26.1% ) , extraintestinal manifestations in 14 patients ( 15.9% ) , and a combination of corticosteroid dependence and extraintestinal manifestations in ten patients ( 11.4% ) . 
 the median duration of adalimumab therapy was 13 months ( iqr , 621 months ) , with a median follow - up duration of 15.5 months ( iqr , 1224 months ) . 
 the co - primary endpoints were defined as the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission ( partial mayo score  1 ) at 4 , 12 , 24 , and 54 weeks . 
 the clinical remission rates were 17% , 28.4% , 36.4% , and 43.2% at 4 , 12 , 24 , and 54 weeks , respectively , with no significant differences between the infliximab - nave and infliximab - exposed patients . 
 fifteen patients ( 17% ) achieved sustained clinical remission , defined as a lasting clinical remission from week 12 up to 24 and 54 weeks . among the 60 patients who were taking steroids at baseline , 56.7% were able to discontinue steroids , and 
 a steroid - free remission was achieved in 24 of 60 patients ( 40.0% ) at week 54 . 
 fifty - seven patients underwent baseline and follow - up endoscopy after a median of 11 months ( iqr , 5.113.2 months ) . 
 an endoscopic remission was achieved in 28 ( 49.1% ) of 57 patients , and 15 ( 26.3% ) of the 57 achieved complete mucosal healing . 
 overall , 25% ( 22 of 88 ) of the patients required colectomy , with a median time to colectomy of 5.5 months ( iqr , 313 months ) . 
 the rate of colectomy was higher in the infliximab - exposed group than in the infliximab - nave group ( 28.9% vs 10.5% ) , but this result did not achieve statistical significance , probably because of the small number of patients who ultimately required surgery and the small number of infliximab - nave patients enrolled in the study . in conclusion , in this large , real - life cohort of refractory and difficult - to - treat ulcerative colitis patients , adalimumab was shown to be effective at inducing and maintaining a durable clinical remission and to have a steroid - sparing effect.35 
 the subcutaneous administration is associated with generally mild injection site reactions that do not necessitate drug discontinuation . 
 the overall safety profile in the clinical trials in patients with ulcerative colitis was comparable to that of placebo , and the rates of adverse events were similar to the ones that emerged for the other approved indications for adalimumab.36 no relevant warnings have emerged from the real - life studies . however , in two studies , a worsening of preexisting psoriasis , leading to drug withdrawal , was recorded.24,28 
 lastly , the fully human - designed features of adalimumab reduce , but do not eliminate , the risk of antidrug antibody development.22 the presence of human anti - human antibodies ( haha ) and low trough serum adalimumab levels have been reported to influence the long - term outcome of adalimumab therapy in patients with crohn s disease . 
 increased adalimumab discontinuation rates have also been reported in crohn s disease patients with low trough serum adalimumab concentrations . 
 furthermore , haha were detected in 92% of crohn s disease patients with low trough serum adalimumab levels during follow - up , probably reflecting the increased clearance of the drug and the subsequent loss of response . 
 finally , concomitant immunosuppressive agents did not affect treatment outcomes , adalimumab trough levels , or haha development.37 
 the treatment of ulcerative colitis depends largely on the extension , severity , and behavior of the disease , and the traditional step - up approach with conventional drugs remains the standard management approach . however , there are subsets of patients who do not respond to conventional therapies or in whom conventional therapies are contraindicated . in these difficult - to - treat patients , 
 the current guidelines recommend the use of biological drugs . in the recent past , infliximab was the only biological drug approved for the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis . 
 recently , after the publication of the results of the two pivotal , randomized ultra 12 trials , adalimumab was approved for use in patients with moderately - to - severely active disease , nonresponders , and those intolerant to conventional therapy . 
 as often happens , the results of a clinical trial should be incorporated into real - life clinical practice , where patients have already experienced several therapies before , and may be intolerant or not fully adherent to treatments . 
 therefore , the goal is to select the candidates who will best benefit from the drug . 
 the emerging concept is that the ideal candidates for adalimumab therapy are anti - tnf-nave outpatients with moderate - to - severe corticosteroid- or immunosuppressive - refractory ulcerative colitis . 
 short - term clinical responses , evaluated after 812 weeks , seem to influence the long - term outcomes and are associated with more durable clinical responses and colectomy - free survival . 
 adalimumab also demonstrated a steroid - sparing effect and a mucosal healing capacity , and it may be a valid option for steroid - dependent patients . as has now been demonstrated in pivotal trials and in several real - life experiences , 
 adalimumab is effective and safe for treating patients with different types of ulcerative colitis , including difficult - to - treat individuals .","maintenance doses scheduled mg every week eow drug shown effective inducing maintaining remission patients active moderate severe luminal perianal crohn disease patients nave anti tnf patients previous loss response intolerance infliximab far ulcerative colitis concerned publication results two pivotal randomized placebo controlled double blind trials ultra table adalimumab approved use patients moderate severe active disease nonresponders intolerant conventional therapy

"using in vivo time - lapse confocal and two - photon imaging of the visual center optic tectum in living larval zebrafish , we first monitored changes in the morphology of microglia under resting state . 
 similar to the typical morphological properties of resting microglia in the mouse cortex , resting microglia in zebrafish are also highly branched with dynamic processes ended with either stick - like or bulbous tips ( fig .  1 ) . 
 these two differently shaped tips can be inter - converted as the process moves around . 
 the bulbous ending forms rapidly through expansion from a stick - like ending , and stalls on the contacted neuronal soma for several minutes before gradually shrinking back again .

 , we further proved that neural activity plays an instructive role in steering the motility of resting microglial processes and the formation of microglia - neuron contact . using glutamate uncaging , we locally upregulated neuronal activity in a small brain region of the intact zebrafish larvae . 
 glutamate uncaging , a non - invasive approach , can efficiently induce a local increase of neural activity . 
 we applied repetitive glutamate uncaging about 20 m away from microglial soma , and found that the processes of resting microglia can gradually navigate toward the uncaging side at about 10 min after the uncaging onset . 
 furthermore , more bulbous tips are formed at the uncaging side , indicating an elevated formation of microglia - neuron contact in responding to the local increase of neuronal activity in vivo . 
 different from the microglia in culture and mammalian brain slices , we found no ionotropic glutamate receptors expressed on microglia in the optic tectum of zebrafish larvae using in vivo whole - cell recording , excluding the possibility that uncaged glutamate directly acts on resting microglia . 
 importantly , the formation of resting microglial bulbous endings can also be regulated by natural sensory inputs , e.g. , visual stimuli , which can globally increase neuronal activity in the optic tectum . however , after global downregulation of neural activity via pre - incubation of larvae with ttx , the number of bulbous endings is markedly decreased . 
 all these results further confirm an instructive role of neuronal activity in regulating the dynamics of resting microglial processes and the formation of microglia - neuron contact . having shown that local elevation of neuronal activity can induce the formation of microglial bulbous endings wrapping neuronal somata 
 , we next asked what might be mechanisms by which neurons with high activity  talk  to resting microglia . 
 we found that this process requires the membrane depolarization - activated pannexin-1 hemichannels on tectal neurons and the atp / p2 purinergic receptor signaling between neurons and microglia . 
 pannexin-1 , a large pore - like hemichannel , is widely expressed in the central nervous system . 
 the opening of pannexin-1 is gated by some cellular signals , such as membrane depolarization , intracellular calcium and so on . 
 small molecules , including atp , nad and pge2 , can be released through these hemichannels . 
 using whole - mount in situ hybridization and in vivo whole - cell recording , we found that the functional pannexin-1 hemichannels are expressed in tectal neurons but not microglia . 
 after impairing the function of pannexin channels by drug treatment or morpholino - mediated genetic downregulation , glutamate uncaging - induced orientated movement of microglial processes and formation of bulbous contacts were prevented . 
 similar results were observed when we applied the atp - hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase or the p2 purinergic receptor blocker suramin . 
 neuronal activity steers resting microglial processes by facilitating the redistribution of the cytoskeleton protein small rho gtpase rac . 
 rac is known to be required for the membrane protrusion and migration of many types of cells , including zebrafish germ cells . 
 using confocal fret imaging , we found that the rac fret intensity is significantly increased in microglial processes , especially at bulbous endings , at the uncaging side after repetitive glutamate uncaging . 
 it is immediately followed by the oriented movement of microglial processes and the formation of bulbous endings . however , if we genetically inhibited endogenous rac activity in microglia , those neuronal activity - induced microglial morphological changes could not be observed . 
 taken together , we identify the underlying mechanisms by which neurons with high activity signal to resting microglia . considering the facilitated formation of microglia - neuron contact induced by neuronal activity increase 
 by simultaneously monitoring changes in both the morphology of microglial processes and ca activity of tectal neurons , we found that microglial processes preferentially contact with neurons that exhibit high levels of spontaneous activity before contact . 
 we then mosaically overexpressed the human inward rectifier k channel kir2.1 ( kir ) , which is used to reduce the excitability of neurons , and a non - conducting mutant version of kir2.1 ( mkir ) in tectal neurons . in comparison with mkir - expressing neurons , 
 these results further indicate that resting microglia preferentially contact neurons with higher activities , consistent with the data obtained with glutamate uncaging . 
 while accumulating evidence shows that resting microglia respond to neural activity , we surprisedly noticed that resting microglia can also in turn regulate neuronal activity . in the zebrafish optic tectum 
 , we found that such resting microglia - neuron contact can downregulate both spontaneous and visually evoked activities in contacted neurons . 
 interestingly , the decreases in both the frequency and magnitude of spontaneous ca activity are positively correlated with the duration of microglia - neuron contact . 
 what is the consequence on neuronal firing after loss of resting microglia ? in response to two - photon laser - induced focal injury , some microglia quickly trans - locate to the injury site . 
 consistent with the speculation based on our previous findings , the spontaneous activity of neurons within microglia pre - existing territories is significantly elevated after the translocation of microglia to the injury site . meanwhile , in other cases with the similar injury but no microglial translocation , the neuronal activity is not significantly changed . 
 thus , our study reveals a functional regulation of neuronal activity by resting microglia under physiological conditions , offering a new way for homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity . 
 collectively , our work brings forth and demonstrates a novel reciprocal regulation between resting microglia and neurons in vivo . 
 we not only demonstrate an instructive role of neuronal activity in resting microglial motility , but also reveal , for the first time , a previously unappreciated function of microglia in homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity in the healthy brain ( fig .  2 ) . 
 considering the bi - directional modulation between neurons and microglia , this study also represents a new perspective in understanding the physiological function of resting microglia . 
 highly active neurons attract resting microglial processes and induce the formation of microglia - neuron contact via atp signaling ( top ) . such neuronal activity - driven microglia - neuron contact in turn 
 using in vivo time - lapse confocal and two - photon imaging of the visual center optic tectum in living larval zebrafish , we first monitored changes in the morphology of microglia under resting state . 
 similar to the typical morphological properties of resting microglia in the mouse cortex , resting microglia in zebrafish are also highly branched with dynamic processes ended with either stick - like or bulbous tips ( fig .  1 ) . 
 these two differently shaped tips can be inter - converted as the process moves around . 
 the bulbous ending forms rapidly through expansion from a stick - like ending , and stalls on the contacted neuronal soma for several minutes before gradually shrinking back again . 
 the existence of resting microglia - neuron contact is further confirmed by using 3-dimensional reconstruction and transmission electron microscopy technique .

 they become activated and participate in scavenging , inflammation and tissue repair in response to brain injury . while the function and underlying mechanism of activated microglia have been intensively studied in the past decades , physiological functions of resting microglia 
 remain largely underestimated . in our recent work , by simultaneously monitoring both the motility of resting microglial processes and the activity of surrounding neurons in intact zebrafish optic tectum , we examined the interaction between resting microglia and neurons . local increase in neuronal 
 activity attracts resting microglial processes and drives them to contact neurons with high levels of activity . 
 this process is mediated by neuronal release of  find - me  signals such as atp via pannexin-1 hemichannels and requires small rho gtpase rac in microglia . 
 reciprocally , the microglia - neuron contact reduces both the spontaneous and visually evoked activities of contacted neurons . we here summarize and explain the key results in the context of our previous work

 white sharks , carcharodon carcharias , observed off the coast of california belong to a genetically distinct population unique to the eastern pacific ( jorgensen et al . 2010 ) . 
 subadult and adults travel long distances offshore from california and northern mexico during yearly migrations ( boustany et al . 2002 ; weng et al . 2007 ; domeier and nasby - lucas 2008 ; jorgensen et al . 
 these offshore movements traverse international waters where individuals are susceptible to fishing mortality , yet few data are available from potential offshore fisheries , confounding efforts to determine white shark population status . 
 therefore , fishery - independent methods must be employed to begin to estimate their population size . 
 mark - recapture methods have been used to estimate white shark population sizes in south africa ( cliff et al . 
 1996 ) , australia ( strong et al . 1996 ) and the northeast pacific ( chapple et al . 2011 ) . 
 these studies are dependent on the assumption that white sharks return to the same location over multiple sampling periods . 
 recent work has illustrated the short - term [ e.g. , < 8  years or 25% of estimated lifespan ( cailliet et al . 1985 ) ] seasonal site fidelity of sharks to coastal aggregation sites . 
 white sharks tagged off coastal california and guadalupe island , mexico returned to their tagging location following offshore movements ( domeier and nasby - lucas 2008 ; jorgensen et al . 
 similarly , a combination of a satellite tag and dorsal fin identification described the movement of a shark in south africa to australia and back in 9  months ( bonfil et al . 2005 ) . 
 however , no studies have tested the long - term [ e.g. , > 14  years or 50% estimated lifespan ( cailliet et al . 
 these mark - recapture frameworks also assume external identification tags or unique markings are conserved and identifiable throughout the study . shedding and 
 therefore , current research on white sharks has focused on the use of distinctive natural markings as individual identifiers ( klimley and anderson 1996 ; strong et al . 1996 ; bonfil et al . 2005 ; domeier and nasby - lucas 2007 ; gubili et al . 
 one method proposed for individual identification in white sharks at guadalupe island utilizes pigmentation patterns ( domeier and nasby - lucas 2007 ) . 
 though resighting requires only one photograph of the gill flaps , pelvic fin or caudal fin on either side , initial identification requires photographs of all three of these locations on both sides of the animal . 
 in addition , the conditions necessary to support this type of identification , superb water visibility and high recreational diving effort , are unique to only guadalupe island . 
 collecting these data is likely to be too labor intensive and impractical in areas outside of guadalupe island with low water visibility ( e.g. , south africa ) and/or limited diving effort ( e.g. , california ) . 
 additionally , pigmentation patterns in several sharks were shown to naturally change in shape and/or size from year to year ( domeier and nasby - lucas 2007 ) . 
 alternately , dorsal fins can be photographed from either side and are often observed out of the water , precluding issues with water clarity or the need for divers . 
 dorsal fin identification , requiring limited effort , is possible at all white shark aggregation sites globally . 
 a comparison of matched individuals using genetic markers and dorsal fin photographs showed a high degree of concordance ( 85% ) between the two techniques over short ( 5  year ) time periods ( gubili et al . 
 white sharks have been shown to exhibit short - term site fidelity and repeatable individual identification through dorsal fin photographs ( klimley and anderson 1996 ; strong et al . 
 2009 ) and body pigmentation ( klimley and anderson 1996 ; domeier and nasby - lucas 2007 ) ; however , in order to understand the long - term status of white sharks , mark - recapture studies must be expanded out to longer time series . 
 therefore , it is imperative to determine whether assumptions regarding site fidelity and identification are valid across these longer time periods ( e.g. , > 14  years ) . 
 here , we aimed to determine ( 1 ) the stability of posterior edge dorsal fin morphology as individual identifiers over long time periods and ( 2 ) use this information to illustrate the long - term site fidelity of individual mature and subadult white sharks at coastal aggregation sites . 
 this study began at the south farallon islands in 1987 ( see anderson et al . 
 , the study was expanded to include coastal areas near tomales bay , california and beginning in 2005 , a small amount of marine mammal blubber was used as bait to increase encounter rates and duration . 
 high - resolution photographs and video were taken of each shark when they came near the surface to investigate a seal - shaped decoy . 
 we extracted dorsal fin images from these photographs and , if above water photographs were not available and water clarity permitted , from underwater video . 
 estimates of total length ( tl ) were also made when possible as sharks swam alongside a research skiff of known length . 
 images were assessed for quality based on four criteria : angle , size , focus , and contrast . 
 images of insufficient quality were removed ( see online resources 1 for discussion of photograph processing methods ) . 
 experts ( individuals with demonstrated expertise matching dorsal fin photographs ) then matched the remaining accepted fin photographs within and across all years simultaneously . if individuals were identified multiple times over the study period , we compared the earliest and latest photographs to determine long - term stability of dorsal fin morphology . when possible , secondary characteristics ( e.g. , tags , permanent scars , mutilations , etc . ) were used to validate these matches . 
 . experts matched 20 randomly chosen photographs from 12 sharks , which had obvious secondary characteristics ( not evident in the fin photographs ) . 
 matching results from each expert were compared to the true matches based on these known secondary characteristics . 
 confirmed males were sighted nearly twice as often as confirmed females ( 1.8:1 ) , though this ratio may be biased because it is easier to confirm the presence of claspers than the absence . 
 if the sex could not be confirmed , the animal was labeled  unknown . 
 four experts accurately identified individuals and matches 98% of the time with no false positives and only one false negative . 
 similarly , gubili et al . ( 2009 ) used genetic data to show nearly 85% accuracy in experts matching dorsal fin photographs . 
 annually , limited effort and photograph quality resulted in the identification of few sharks before 2006 when effort increased and digital slrs were used . prior to 2006 , over 60% of sharks were resighted ( 29 of 48 ) . in 2006 and 2007 , significantly more new sharks were recorded ( 76 ) , but by 2008 , 35% ( 27 ) of these new sharks had been resighted at least once . 
 twenty - one individuals were repeatedly identified over periods 5  year , ten individuals 10  years , and five individuals 15  years ( fig .  1 ) . 
 to illustrate the stability of markers and the empirical evidence of longevity , we describe five individuals resighted over periods 15  years at south farallon islands ( fig .

 all tl estimates given refer to the size at the most recent sighting of each shark . 
 our findings support the use of the trailing edge of the dorsal fin for long - term photo - identification studies at coastal aggregation sites . 
 we photographically identified five white sharks repeatedly over a period of 1622  years . through the use of secondary characteristics and comparisons of first and last photographs of these five sharks 
 , we found no evidence of changes in the size , shape , or arrangement of existing notches on these fins . 
 we did , however , identify two sharks that incurred changes to their dorsal fins within the study period . 
 these two sharks , a 4.9-m - tl female photographed each year from 2004 to 2008 ( fig . 
 3a ) and a 4.3-m - tl male sighted november 07 , 2008 , and again 11  days later on november 18 ( fig . 
 3b ) , were shown to incur damage to their dorsal fins over the periods sighted . though the trailing edge of the dorsal fin was damaged , creating a new notch , identifiable markings above and below this notch remained unchanged and sufficient for identification , illustrating how even relatively major fin trauma may results in the addition of a notch while leaving ample morphologic information for a positive identification . 
 it is possible that the entire fin edge could be removed or altered due to major trauma preventing matching to previous sightings , but we saw no indication of this type of trauma during the 22  years of this study , which suggests this would be an extremely rare occurrence.fig .

 b a second shark showing new damage over a two - month period in 2008 dorsal fin identification also supports the long - term ( 15  years ) site fidelity of white sharks at coastal aggregation sites and provides the longest empirical documentation of white shark longevity to date , > 22  years . 
 individual identification illustrated that animals returned to these sites consistently throughout the study period and potentially during their entire adult life span . 
 each animal was not necessarily seen every year , but unequal effort across both spatial and temporal scales most likely contributed greatly to such gaps in identification . 
 additionally , the prevalence of short - term resights ( < 5  years ) is also largely attributed to increased effort during the last 3  years of the study ( fig .  1 ) . 
 this methodology , obtaining one photograph of the dorsal fin , requires far less effort than methods to document body pigmentation patterns and does not suffer from large rates of tag shedding or biofouling as traditional tagging methods do . 
 many of the white sharks in this study have been tagged with ( on occasion multiple ) pop - off archival tags , ultrasonic transmitters and/or floy tags , which have the potential to shed within a short time span ( < 1  year ) ( jorgensen et al . 2010 ) , precluding their use in long - term mark - recapture studies . 
 in addition , further effort to automate the matching process will make the process more feasible with large datasets , allowing for the universal comparison of animals across different geographic regions regardless of diving effort or water clarity conditions . 
 dorsal fin identification offers the foundation for mark - recapture studies to quantify the population size and trends of white sharks . if possible , we suggest all available data be recorded ( e.g. , fin photographs and body pigments ) 
 therefore , we propose that dorsal fins , because of their ease in recording , illustrated longevity and potential for universal application , be prioritized as a method to document individual white sharks . this methodology can not only be used to monitor the status of the white shark population in the northeast pacific , but unlike other photo - identification methods , it can be more uniformly applied to archive white sharks worldwide , standardizing documentation of individuals across vast spatial and temporal scales .

"studies over the past four decades have shown that 3.9%-16% of patients with pancreatic cancer ( paca ) have a family history of the disease , which is referred to as familial pancreatic cancer ( fpc ) . 
 fpc describes families with at least two first - degree relatives with confirmed exocrine paca that do not fulfil the criteria of other inherited tumor syndromes with increased risks of paca , such as peutz - jeghers syndrome , hereditary pancreatitis , and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer . 
 the first studies to explore what is now referred to as fpc were case reports of families in which there were multiple cases of paca . in 1973 , 
 macdermott and kramer   described a family , in which paca developed in four out of the six siblings . 
 a small fraction of this aggregation can be accounted for inherited cancer syndromes , including familial atypical multiple - mole melanoma ( famm ) , peutz - jeghers syndrome , hereditary breast - ovarian cancer ( hboc ) , hereditary pancreatitis ( hp ) , and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( hnpcc ) . 
 these syndromes arise as a result of germline mutations in the cdkn2a ( famm ) , stk11 ( peutz - jeghers syndrome ) , brca1 , brca2 , atm ( hboc ) , prss1 ( hp ) , mlh1 , and msh2 ( hnpcc ) genes . 
 in addition , heredity plays an important role in certain patients with apparently sporadic paca . 
 many patients with pacas caused by a germline mutation in a cancer - causing gene do not have a pedigree suggestive of a familial cancer syndrome . 
 although much has been learned over the past few decades regarding the aggregation of paca in some families , the genetic basis for most of this familial aggregation is still poorly understood . 
 ten founder mutations in four cancer predisposing genes have been identified in poland [ 4 - 6 ] . 
 these include three founder mutations in brca1 ( 5382insc , 4153dela , and c61 g ) , four in chek2 ( 1100delc , ivs2 + 1g > a , del5395 , and i157 t ) , one variant allele in nbs1 ( 657del5 ) , and two in palb2 ( 509_510delga and 172_175delttgt ) [ 4 - 6 ] . 
 the results of our previous case / control studies showed that these mutations in brca1 , chek2 , nbs1 , and palb2 are associated with the cancer risk at different sites of origin [ 4 - 12 ] . 
 a recent study evaluated the prevalence of these founder mutations among sporadic paca patients and showed that the risk of sporadic paca is associated with the slavic founder mutation of nbs1 657del5 ( odds ratio [ or ] , 3.80 ; p=0.002 ) . 
 a hereditary predisposition to different cancers , which is characteristic of the aforementioned genes , suggests that there could be a potential link between polish founder mutations and a predisposition to fpc . 
 therefore , the aim of this study was to establish the prevalence of ten polish founder mutations in brca1 , chek2 , nbs1 , and palb2 among individuals from families with familial paca syndrome and to assess their possible association with the fpc risk in poland . 
 a total of 400 individuals from fpc syndrome families were genotyped and the frequencies of the founder mutations were compared with a set of healthy control subjects representative of the polish population . 
 the recruitment of individuals for this study was conducted between 2002 and 2014 . the majority ( 80% ) were patients of our center , living in north - western poland , as well as in other cities of the country : biaystok , krakw , ld , olsztyn , opole , rzeszw , widnica , zielona gra , kielce . 
 the study involved 400 probands from families with a diagnosis of fpc syndrome , who were either healthy individuals ( n=295 ) or fpc patients with cancer ( n=105 ) . table 1 lists the characteristics of the individuals included in the study . each of the 400 study participants came from a family , in which there were two or more cases of paca among the first - degree relatives . 
 the mean age of the participants enrolled in this study was 49.44 years ( range , 19 to 91 years ) . 
 a family history of cancer was taken either by the construction of a family tree or the completion of a standardized questionnaire . 
 this study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki and all participants signed an informed consent document prior to donating the blood samples . furthermore , this study was approved by the ethics committee of the pomeranian medical university in szczecin , poland . 
 the first consisted of 2,000 newborn children from 10 hospitals throughout poland ( szczecin , biaystok , gorzw , katowice , wrocaw , pozna , opole , ld , and rzeszw ) collected between 2003 and 2004 . 
 samples of cord blood from unselected infants were forwarded to the study center in szczecin . 
 the second group was taken from adult patient lists of three family doctors practicing in the szczecin region . 
 a total of 1,000 controls were selected at random from the patient lists of these family doctors . 
 the third group consisted of 1,000 adults from szczecin who submitted blood for paternity testing . 
 a sample of dna was forwarded to the reference laboratory without any identifying information . to ensure comparability of the control groups , 
 the allele frequencies of the 10 alleles was computed separately for the adult and neonatal control groups and compared to determine if there were any differences in allele frequencies . 
 ten founder mutations in the brca1 , chek2 , nbs1 , and palb2 genes were genotyped , as described previously . 
 briefly , brca1 mutations , 4153dela and 5382insc were detected using the allele - specific oligonucleotide polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) , and c61 g was detected using the restriction fragment length polymorphism pcr .

 sanger direct sequencing was undertaken to confirm the presence of mutations , using a bigdye terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit ( life technologies ) , according to the manufacturer s protocol . 
 all ten mutations were analyzed successfully in 398 of the 400 fpc cases ( 99.5% ) . 
 the two that failed to be analyzed due to the poor quality of dna were discarded from statistical analysis . 
 the ors were generated from two - by - two tables and the statistical significance was assessed using a chi - square or fisher exact test with a yates correction . 
 a founder mutation in one of the four genes studied was observed in 44 out of 398 fpc cases ( 11.06% ) and in 283 out of 4,000 controls ( 7.08% ) ( p=0.011 ; or , 1.56 ; 95% confidence interval , 1.12 to 2.18 ) . 
 table 2 provides details of the prevalence of founder mutations studied among individuals from fpc families and in the population control group . in the group of all fpc individuals , the largest and statistically significant difference compared to the population control group 
 was observed for palb2 172_175delttgt ( 0.5% ; or , 10.05 ; p=0.048 ) . when the genotyping results were classified according to the health status of the probands , statistically significant differences were observed for the brca1 , palb2 and chek2 genes only in the group of fpc cases with cancer . 
 two ( 5382insc , c61 g ) of the three polish founder brca1 mutations were detected in three of the 105 fpc cases with cancer ( 2.86% ) ( or , 6.72 ; p=0.006 ) compared to 17 of the 4,000 controls ( 0.42% ) . 
 palb2 mutations were observed in two of the 105 fpc cases with cancer ( 1.90% ) ( or , 9.52 ; p=0.014 ) compared to eight of the 4,000 controls ( 0.20% ) . 
 chek2 mutations ( all four mutations combined ) were detected in 14 of the 105 fpc cases with cancer ( 13.33% ) ( or , 2.26 ; p=0.008 ) compared to 236 of the 4,000 controls ( 5.9% ) . 
 the chek2 
 i157 t missense mutation contributed the largest and was present in 11 of the 105 fpc cases with cancer ( or , 2.17 ; p=0.026 ) compared to 193 of the 4,000 controls . a single nbs1 mutation ( 657del5 ) was detected in three of the 389 unselected fpc cases ( 0.75% ) : two healthy fpc probands ( 0.68% ) , and one of the 105 fpc cases with cancer ( 0.95% ) , compared to 22 of the 4,000 controls ( 0.55% ) , but none of the associations were statistically significant . 
 this study observed a significant correlation between the prevalence of the polish founder mutation 172_175delttgt of palb2 gene and the fpc . 
 in addition , an increased incidence of changes was observed in genes brca1 ( three founder mutation combined : p=0.006 ; or , 6.72 ) and chek2 ( four chek2 mutations combined : p=0.008 ; or , 2.26 ) , particularly the chek2 
 i157 t mutation ( p=0.03 ; or , 2.17 ) among the cancer - affected individuals from the fpc syndrome families . the fact that brca1 and palb2 mutations might be causative of fpc in a small subset of families is relatively new [ 14 - 16 ] . 
 furthermore , the results are consistent with the observations that palb2 and brca1 mutations are reported in fpc , especially in the families with a history of breast cancer . 
 breast cancer was also observed among the first degree relatives of one of the palb2 172_175delttgt and one of the brca1 5382insc mutation carriers from fpc . 
 the most valuable observation of the present study is the increased risk of fpc among carriers of chek2 mutations , particularly the chek2 
 i157 t missense variant . 
 chek2 is a human homologue of the yeast cds1 and rad53 genes , which encodes the cell cycle checkpoint kinase . 
 therefore , chek2 plays an important role in the network of cell cycle regulation and dna damage repair , which are crucial processes in preventing cancer development . 
 four founder alleles of chek2 are present in poland ; three of these result in a truncated chek2 protein ( 1100delc , ivs2 + 1g > a and del5395 ) and the fourth ( i157 t ) is a missense substitution of an isoleucine by a threonine in exon 3 . 
 the feature of the founder mutations in the chek2 gene is the multiorgan cancer risk among carriers . 
 positive associations with protein - truncating alleles in the chek2 gene are observed for cancers of the prostate and thyroid . the large germline deletion in chek2 
 the missense variant , i157 t , is associated with an increased risk of colon , kidney , prostate , thyroid , and stomach cancers . in light of existing research , it can be assumed that chek2 gene mutations are more specific to a certain percentage of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract . in a study conducted at our center including 463 individuals , it has been shown that the i157 t variant of chek2 increases the risk of colorectal cancer among mismatch repair  negative hnpcc / hnpcc - related families from poland ( or , 2.1 ; p=0.0004 ) . 
 polish founder mutations in the chek2 gene were also observed in 57 out of 658 unselected patients with gastric cancer ( 8.7% ) compared to 480 out of 8,302 controls ( 5.8% ) ( or , 1.6 ; p=0.004 ) . 
 overall , it can be concluded that fpc is another malignant tumor from the spectrum of digestive system cancers associated with mutations of the chek2 gene . 
 the results of a previous study conducted among 383 paca cases did not show this association for sporadic cancers of the pancreas . 
 the current relationship between the chek2 mutation and the occurrence of fpc can be explained by the multiorgan nature of the familial cancer predisposition of chek2 mutations . 
 note that among the fpc cancer cases with detected chek2 mutations , there were cases not only with paca , but also with cancer of the breast , cervix , thyroid , and melanoma . 
 thus far , the possible relationship between chek2 mutations and fpc has not been evaluated extensively . in one existing german study based on the genotyping of 35 patients from families with fpc syndrome , 
 the chek2 1100delc mutation was identified in one out of 35 fpc cases ( 3% ) . 
 the authors of that study suggested a possible contribution of the chek2 mutation in a small subset of fpc . 
 in addition , it is believed that mutations of the chek2 gene , similar to the mutations in the other aforementioned genes , cause only a small percentage of fpc cases . 
 therefore , it can be assumed , that the search for genes that predispose to fpc , will bring to light new genes , but none of them will be responsible for a large percentage of families with fpc . 
 note that mutation carriers with cancer in the present study were affected by cancers at different sites ( supplementary table 1 ) . among those , chek2 mutation carriers had the largest variety of different neoplasms , i.e. , multiple breast cancers , cervical cancers , and single cases of thyroid cancer , paca , and malignant melanoma . 
 three brca1 carriers with cancer were observed , two of which had breast cancer and one ovarian cancer . 
 these three brca1 mutation carriers had no other family member with breast and/or ovarian cancer . 
 the nature of the chek2 gene as a multiorgan cancer predisposition gene has been reported [ 4,5,8 - 11 ] , which explains the occurrence of cancer at different sites among the chek2 mutation carriers in the present study . despite the single cases of different cancers in these families with paca 
 , they only fulfil the criteria for fpc and did not meet the criteria for any other defined inherited tumor syndrome except for three carriers of a brca1 mutation ( hboc , brca1 type ) . 
 our previous study conducted among 383 paca patients reported that the polish founder mutation in nbs1 ( 657del5 ) is associated with an increased risk of paca ( or , 3.80 ; p=0.002 ) . while the results of the current study , including almost 400 cases from fpc families presented here , did not show a relationship between the nbs1 and fpc syndrome . 
 it might mean that a nbs1 mutation is not associated with the risk of fpc . 
 on the other hand , it is equally possible that a relationship between the nbs1 and fpc risk was not observed because of the relatively small number of cases with cancer ( n=105 ) present in this study , in addition to the low penetrance of nbs1 mutation . indeed , 
 more cases of cancer from fpc families should be analyzed in the future to resolve this suspicion . 
 the major limitation of this study was the small number of cases with cancer from fpc families subjected to genotyping . 
 these results should be verified with a larger series of fpc cases from both the polish and other populations . 
 this case control study indicated that mutations in palb2 ( 172_175delttgt ) appear to increase the risk of fpc in heterozygous carriers from the polish population . 
 in addition , the fpc risk appears to be increased in carriers of brca1 ( two of the three occurring : 5382insc , c61 g ) and chek2 founder mutations ( particularly chek2-i157 t missense variant ) . 
 therefore , in the polish population , founder mutations in the genes , brca1 , palb2 , and chek2 , cause a small percentage of familial paca 
 . studies in slavic and other populations should be performed to confirm this association and evaluate the utility of testing these genes for fpc in cancer genetic counselling .

 although much has been learned regarding the aggregation of pancreatic cancer in some families , the genetic basis for this familial aggregation is poorly understood . 
 this study evaluated the prevalence of 10 polish founder mutations in four genes among individuals from families with diagnosed familial pancreatic cancer syndrome and assessed their possible association with the familial pancreatic cancer ( fpc ) risk in poland.materials and methodsin this study , 400 fpc individuals and 4,000 control subjects were genotyped for founder mutations in brca1 ( 5382insc , 4153dela , c61 g ) , chek2 ( 1100delc , ivs2 + 1g > a , del5395 , i157 t ) , nbs1 ( 657del5 ) , and palb2 ( 509_510delga , 172_175delttgt ) genes.resultsa statistically significant association was observed between the 172_175delttgt mutation of the palb2 gene and an increased risk of fpc syndrome ( odds ratio [ or ] , 10.05 ; p=0.048 ) . 
 in addition , an increased risk of cancer was observed in the fpc family members with a brca1 mutation ( or , 6.72 ; p=0.006 ) . 
 novel associations were found between the fpc family members with cancer and chek2 mutations ( or , 2.26 ; p=0.008 ) with a noticeable contribution of the missense variant , i157 t of chek2 ( or , 2.17 ; p=0.026).conclusionthe founder mutations in the genes , brca1 , palb2 , and chek2 , cause a small percentage of familial pancreatic cancer syndrome in the polish population . following confirmation in larger studies 
 , these mutations can be added to the panel of genes to be tested in families with a diagnosis of fpc syndrome ."
"the general secretory ( sec ) pathway , conserved throughout bacteria , is the canonical translocation pathway and is responsible for translocating the vast majority of secreted proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane . like other general translocation pathways 
 , sec requires the synthesis of its cargo as preproteins with n - terminal signal peptides , which target them to the sec machinery and from which the mature protein must be released after translocation ( 1 , 2 ) . 
 the enzyme responsible for the liberation of most mature proteins translocated by sec is type i signal peptidase ( spase ) ( 35 ) . 
 accordingly , spase has been demonstrated to be essential in both gram - positive and gram - negative bacteria . 
 staphylococcus aureus is a striking example of the importance of spase , as it mediates the secretion of a diverse range of virulence factors , including proteins required for adhesion and colonization , evasion of the host immune response , scavenging of nutrients and minerals from the environment , and dissemination ( 6 ) . 
 the arylomycin family of natural products are potent inhibitors of spase ( 710 ) . as part of an effort to develop the arylomycins as therapeutics 
 , we and others have been exploring the optimization of their spectrum of activity ( 1113 ) . 
 an arylomycin with particularly promising activity against s.  aureus is arylomycin m131 ( fig . 
 we have also developed the arylomycins as chemical biology probes to assess secretion in different bacteria , including staphylococcus epidermidis ( 14 ) and s.  aureus ( 6 ) . 
 as part of these efforts , we recently demonstrated that s.  aureus responds to arylomycin - mediated spase inhibition by increasing expression of the four adjacent genes , sa0337 to sa0340 , and that arylomycin resistance is conferred by loss - of - function mutations in sa0337 ( 15 ) . 
 ( b ) genomic organization of the ayrrabc operon ( ayrr , sa0337 ; ayra , sa0338 ; ayrb , sa0339 ; ayrc , sa0340 ) and the region immediately upstream that includes sa0336 . 
 below is the sequence of the putative promoter region upstream of ayrr ending with its gtg translational start site . a 22-nt palindromic repeat ( arrows ) 
 the positions of the putative 35 and 10 regions and ribosome binding site ( rbs ) are indicated in the coding strand . 
 the transcriptional start site is marked as + 1 , corresponding to 18  nt upstream from the translational start site . 
 ( c ) rt - pcr analysis of the ayrrabc operon and divergent genes ( sa0334 to sa0336 ) . 
 gyrb was used as an external control , and gene expression was normalized using gmk . 
 ( d ) gel shifts performed with 30  ng of each dna probe and an increasing concentration of ayrr as indicated at the top . 
 the region of dna corresponding to each gel shift probe is shown above the gel data , with the ayrr binding site shown in red . 
 filled triangles denote free dna probe , and open triangles denote the indicated dna - ayrr complexes . 
 all dna probes were amplified from wild - type n315 genomic dna with the exception of irpal , which was created by annealing synthetic oligonucleotides . 
 ( e ) luminescence from the ayrr promoter ( expressed from parc1 ) in wild - type n315 and n315sa0336-ayrrabc ( labeled ayrr ) , expressed as counts per second per unit of optical density at 590 nm ( cps / od590 ) . 
 ( f ) luminescence from n315 harboring parc1 in the presence and absence of arylomycin m131 ( 0.5 mic ) . here 
 , we demonstrate that the genes sa0337 to sa0340 constitute an operon and that sa0337 is a transcriptional repressor that controls its expression . 
 remarkably , derepression of these genes bypasses the need for spase , rendering spase nonessential and suggesting that the function of the operon is to mediate an alternate process by which translocated proteins are released from the cytoplasmic membrane . 
 we have thus named the repressor gene ayrr and the downstream genes ayrabc for their role in arylomycin resistance . 
 sequence analysis identifies ayra as a 6-transmembrane - domain protein of unknown function ( duf3169/pf11368 ) and ayrb and ayrc as two domains of an abc transporter , and we demonstrate that all three are required to bypass spase . finally , we demonstrate that ayrabc is able to mediate secretion of the proteins normally processed by spase , although in some cases with reduced efficiency , but it does so either with the signal peptide still attached or after cleavage at a site within the signal peptide . 
 the stop and start codons of ayrr and ayra overlap , as do those of ayrb and ayrc , while the stop and start codons of ayra and ayrb are separated by only 24  bp ( fig . 
 using reverse transcription - pcr ( rt - pcr ) , we examined transcription of ayrrabc in the arylomycin - resistant strain arc0001 , which harbors a nonsense mutation in ayrr ( 15 ) , and its parental wild - type strain n315 . 
 as expected , no differences in transcript levels were observed for control genes ( sa0334 to sa0336 and gyrb ) , but transcript levels of ayrr , ayra , ayrb , and ayrc in arc0001 were each increased ~8-fold compared to those in the wild type ( fig . 
 moreover , analysis of our previously published rna - seq data ( 15 ) reveals reads that when overlapped align continuously across the entire ayrrabc locus , including the intergenic sequences ( see fig . 
 collectively , these results suggest that ayrrabc is an operon and demonstrate that the mutation in ayrr that renders s.  aureus resistant to spase inhibition results in operon derepression . 
 ayrr encodes a helix - turn - helix motif protein annotated as an xre family transcriptional regulator with homology to the phage  cro repressor . 
 sequence analysis revealed an almost perfect 22-nucleotide ( nt ) palindrome , tttgacaaatatagttgtcaaa , upstream of ayrr which overlaps the 35 promoter element ( fig . 
 such palindromes commonly compose the binding site of transcriptional regulators ( 16 ) , and cro regulates its own transcription by binding such a palindrome ( 17 , 18 ) . to determine if ayrr binds its upstream palindrome , a gel shift assay was employed using various dna fragments ( fig . 
 the data clearly demonstrate that ayrr selectively binds the palindrome . to test the functional significance of this binding 
 , we constructed the transcriptional reporter plasmid parc1 , which harbors the intergenic region between sa0336 and ayrr upstream of the genes encoding luciferase ( luxcdabe ) ( 19 ) . 
 wild - type n315 and a strain lacking the entire region from sa0336 to ayrc ( n315sa0336-ayrrabc ) were then transformed with either the empty luxcdabe vector or parc1 , and luminescence was assayed in actively growing cultures ( fig . 
 luminescence was significantly lower for n315 harboring parc1 , consistent with repression by the genomically encoded ayrr protein . 
 as an additional control , the ability of spase inhibition to release repression was tested by conducting the same experiment in the presence of a subinhibitory concentration of arylomycin m131 ( 0.5 mic ) . 
 two  hours after arylomycin addition , the luminescence signal observed with wild - type n315 cells harboring parc1 was 7-fold higher than that observed in the absence of arylomycin ( fig . 
 these results confirm that ayrr acts as a repressor of ayrrabc and that spase inhibition induces derepression . 
 ayra encodes a putative membrane protein , predicted to possess a duf3169 domain of unknown function . 
 proteins in the duf3169 family are found in both staphylococcus and streptococcus species , with one homolog present per genome in sequenced strains , and while they share only ~30% sequence identity , six predicted transmembrane domains and a d - e(a / g)e motif located in the loop connecting the fourth and fifth predicted transmembrane segments are highly conserved . 
 interestingly , each ayra homolog identified appears to be immediately downstream of a gene that is homologous to ayrr . 
 the downstream genes ayrb and ayrc are predicted to encode the two domains of a type 2 family abc transporter , with ayrc encoding the transporter domain and ayrb encoding the atp - binding cassette domain ( conserved domain cd03230 ) . 
 although ayra could be deleted in an otherwise wild - type strain ( n315 ) , we were unable to delete ayra in arc0001 . 
 thus , to test whether ayra is required to tolerate spase inhibition , we attempted to evolve arylomycin resistance in n315ayra . 
 as a control , we constructed and analyzed a strain lacking sa0336 , which is predicted to encode a hypothetical protein and which is not part of the ayrrabc operon . 
 high - level arylomycin m131 resistance ( > 16  g / ml ) was evolved in n315sa0336 with frequencies indistinguishable from the wild - type parental strain ( 2.0  10 ) ( 15 ) ( see table  s2  in the supplemental material ) . 
 in addition , sequencing revealed that 8 out of 8 of the resistant strains examined contained mutations in ayrr ( see table  s3  in the supplemental material ) , similar to the behavior observed with wild - type cells ( 15 ) . 
 in contrast , n315ayra developed high - level resistance with a significantly reduced frequency ( 2.9  10 ) ( see table  s2 ) , and for the single resistant clone isolated , sequencing revealed a wild - type ayrr . 
 deletion of ayrbc in arc0001 ( arc0001ayrbc ) resulted in full resensitization to arylomycin m131 , demonstrating that the abc transporter is required to tolerate spase inhibition ( see table  s2  in the supplemental material ) . 
 moreover , deletion of ayrbc in n315 ( n315ayrbc ) results in the same reduced frequency of resistance to arylomycin m131 that was observed with n315ayra ( see table  s2 ) , and again , sequencing revealed wild - type ayrr in the single resistant mutant isolated . collectively , these results demonstrate that each member of the ayrrabc operon is required to tolerate spase inhibition . 
 because derepression of ayrrabc in s. aureus confers high - level resistance to spase inhibition , we speculated that it may render spase nonessential . using the same chromosomal integration approach 
 , we attempted to delete the spase gene spsb in arc0001 and its parental wild - type strain , n315 . 
 not surprisingly , attempts to delete spsb in the wild - type strain resulted in the recovery of the wild - type sequence . 
 in addition to confirming the absence of spsb at its chromosomal locus via sequencing , we demonstrated that spsb was not present elsewhere in the genome of arc0001spsb via pcr and rt - pcr of genomic dna and rna , respectively , using primers internal to the spsb gene ( see table  s4  in the supplemental material ) . 
 deletion of spsb was also verified phenotypically via an examination of the susceptibility of n315 and arc0001spsb to gentamicin and the -lactam antibiotics cefoxitin , oxacillin , and penicillin g. previously , we and others demonstrated that the activity of these antibiotics is uniquely synergistic with that of the arylomycins ( 13 , 20 ) . as controls , we also examined susceptibilities to cccp , vancomycin , daptomycin , erythromycin , trimethoprim , and tetracycline . for each control antibiotic tested , the observed susceptibilities of n315 were virtually identical to those observed for n315 and arc0001 ( 15 ) . 
 however , the susceptibility of arc0001spsb to gentamicin and each -lactam was 8- to 64-fold greater than that of n315 or arc0001 ( see table  s5  in the supplemental material ) , consistent with the absence of spase activity . 
 we next evaluated protein secretion in n315 , arc0001 , and arc0001spsb using one - dimensional ( 1d ) sds - page ( fig .  2 ) . 
 identical patterns of secretion were observed for the wild type and arc0001 , which suggests that arc0001 still employs spase even though the ayrrabc operon is derepressed . 
 in contrast , a small but clearly significant alteration in the pattern of secretion was apparent for arc0001spsb . to confirm that this altered pattern of secretion was the result of the loss of spase activity , 
 secretion was examined in the presence of arylomycin m131 ( 4 mic ) . as expected , 
 wild - type cells showed drastically reduced levels of secretion in the presence of the arylomycin . 
 however , treatment of arc0001 cells with the arylomycin did not reduce secretion and resulted in a secretion pattern indistinguishable from that of arc0001spsb , clearly revealing that the altered pattern does indeed result from the absence of spase activity . 
 moreover , the pattern and quantity of secreted proteins observed with arc0001spsb were unchanged by the addition of the arylomycin , confirming that secretion did not depend on spase function .

 , strains were grown until wild - type n315 reached an od590 of 4.0 , corresponding to late exponential growth . 
 strains were then balanced to an od590 of 4.0 , pelleted by centrifugation , and washed twice with medium before resuspension in fresh medium . 
 strains were then grown in the presence or absence of 4 mic of arylomycin m131 ( n315 ) for 20  min . 
 proteins in the supernatant were precipitated overnight with 10% ( wt / vol ) tca , washed with acetone , resuspended in 1 loading dye , and visualized by sds - page . 
 arrows denote bands where significant differences are observed in the extracellular proteomes of wild - type n315 and arc0001spsb . 
 the secreted proteomes of arc0001spsb and n315 were next compared in more detail by isolating proteins from the medium , digesting with trypsin , using reductive dimethylation ( redime ) to label the wild - type fragments with heavy isotopes and label the arc0001spsb fragments with light isotopes , and then analyzing the combined samples via multidimensional mass spectrometry ( mudpit ) ( 21 , 22 ) . in total , 
 tryptic peptides corresponding to 38 proteins that are encoded with signal peptides were identified ( table  1 ) , which is consistent with previous studies of the s.  aureus secretome ( 6 ) . the quantity of secreted proteins was then determined from the ratio of parent ion peak areas , which demonstrated that while tryptic peptides for the same proteins were detected from each strain , several were detected at different levels ( table  1 ) . 
 sixteen of the 38 secreted proteins were detected in both strains at similar levels ( within 2-fold ) , while 20 were detected at 2- to 8-fold - reduced levels ( for example , the proteases staphylokinase and sspp , the complement inhibitor sak , and a hypothetical surface protein sa2285 ) . 
 two proteins ( sa0663 and sdre ) were detected at 6- to 8-fold - elevated levels in the spsb strain , while prsa was detected at a 16-fold - elevated level . 
 prsa is a peptidyl - prolyl isomerase involved in protein folding of secreted proteins in the extracellular environment ( 23 ) , and we previously demonstrated that it is upregulated at the transcriptional level by spase inhibition . 
 comparison of the secreted proteomes of wild - type n315 and arc0001spsb reported as the average for all detected tryptic peptides for a given protein . 
 data are averages and standard errors of the means for three independent biological samples . underlined amino acids correspond to tryptic peptides detected in arc0001spsb which contain part of the spase signal sequence . 
 as expected for secretion mediated by spase , none of the tryptic peptides isolated from the wild - type sample contained any part of the signal peptide ; however , peptide fragments for eight of the proteins were found with n termini that precisely matched the predicted spase cleavage site ( see fig . 
 in contrast , with arc0001spsb , tryptic peptides containing portions of the n - terminal leader peptides of 12 of the 38 proteins were detected ( table  1 ; also , see fig . 
 these data suggest that ayrabc mediates secretion of the same proteins as does spase but either via cleavage at a more n - terminal site or perhaps by extricating the entire intact preprotein from the cytoplasmic membrane . 
 spase functions at the terminal step of the general secretory pathway by releasing translocated proteins from the cytoplasmic membrane at a defined cleavage site . 
 we have provided evidence of an inducible alternative terminal step in s.  aureus encoded by the ayrrabc operon , which under normal conditions is repressed by ayrr but which is derepressed by spase inhibition . 
 the natural physiological role of the pathway may be to support spase function at times when elevated secretion is required and the capacity of spase has been exceeded . 
 alternatively , it may have evolved to facilitate survival in the presence of an spase inhibitor . 
 the latter possibility is consistent with the fact that spase is the only component of the general secretory pathway that is exposed on the outer surface of the cytoplasmic membrane , making it uniquely susceptible to extracellular inhibitors . 
 the evolution of four different families of arylomycins ( 10 ) further suggests that that spase inhibition may have represented a significant selection pressure , as does the existence of multiple , redundant spases in many gram - positive bacteria . 
 hints as to the mechanism by which ayrabc mediates the release of proteins from their attachment to the cell may be gleaned from an analysis of the individual genes . 
 it is possible that the abc transporter functions as part of the translocation process , perhaps augmenting or even replacing other components of the general secretory pathway . 
 however , bacterial abc transporters have been identified that extract lipophilic moieties from the cytoplasmic membrane ( 24 ) , and ayrbc may function after sec translocation to extract intact preproteins or proteins after intramembrane cleavage . 
 the role of ayra , which encodes a membrane protein of unknown function , is even less clear , but it is interesting to speculate that it could be a protease responsible for intramembrane cleavage , if one is required , which is consistent with its predicted membrane localization . 
 it is also interesting that ayrr homologs in other species appear to control the regulation of proteases ( 25 , 26 ) . 
 a more complete understanding of the pathway awaits detailed analysis of these proteins as well as the signal responsible for derepression of the operon , which is in progress . 
 undoubtedly , understanding the mechanistic details of this alternate terminal step of the sec pathway will lead to a greater understanding of secretion and the response to secretion stress . 
 the stop and start codons of ayrr and ayra overlap , as do those of ayrb and ayrc , while the stop and start codons of ayra and ayrb are separated by only 24  bp ( fig . 
 using reverse transcription - pcr ( rt - pcr ) , we examined transcription of ayrrabc in the arylomycin - resistant strain arc0001 , which harbors a nonsense mutation in ayrr ( 15 ) , and its parental wild - type strain n315 . 
 as expected , no differences in transcript levels were observed for control genes ( sa0334 to sa0336 and gyrb ) , but transcript levels of ayrr , ayra , ayrb , and ayrc in arc0001 were each increased ~8-fold compared to those in the wild type ( fig . 
 1c ) . moreover , analysis of our previously published rna - seq data ( 15 ) reveals reads that when overlapped align continuously across the entire ayrrabc locus , including the intergenic sequences ( see fig . 
 collectively , these results suggest that ayrrabc is an operon and demonstrate that the mutation in ayrr that renders s.  aureus resistant to spase inhibition results in operon derepression . 
 ayrr encodes a helix - turn - helix motif protein annotated as an xre family transcriptional regulator with homology to the phage  cro repressor . 
 sequence analysis revealed an almost perfect 22-nucleotide ( nt ) palindrome , tttgacaaatatagttgtcaaa , upstream of ayrr which overlaps the 35 promoter element ( fig . 
 such palindromes commonly compose the binding site of transcriptional regulators ( 16 ) , and cro regulates its own transcription by binding such a palindrome ( 17 , 18 ) . to determine 
 if ayrr binds its upstream palindrome , a gel shift assay was employed using various dna fragments ( fig . 
 to test the functional significance of this binding , we constructed the transcriptional reporter plasmid parc1 , which harbors the intergenic region between sa0336 and ayrr upstream of the genes encoding luciferase ( luxcdabe ) ( 19 ) . 
 wild - type n315 and a strain lacking the entire region from sa0336 to ayrc ( n315sa0336-ayrrabc ) were then transformed with either the empty luxcdabe vector or parc1 , and luminescence was assayed in actively growing cultures ( fig . 
 luminescence was significantly lower for n315 harboring parc1 , consistent with repression by the genomically encoded ayrr protein . 
 as an additional control , the ability of spase inhibition to release repression was tested by conducting the same experiment in the presence of a subinhibitory concentration of arylomycin m131 ( 0.5 mic ) . 
 two  hours after arylomycin addition , the luminescence signal observed with wild - type n315 cells harboring parc1 was 7-fold higher than that observed in the absence of arylomycin ( fig . 
 these results confirm that ayrr acts as a repressor of ayrrabc and that spase inhibition induces derepression . 
 ayra encodes a putative membrane protein , predicted to possess a duf3169 domain of unknown function . 
 proteins in the duf3169 family are found in both staphylococcus and streptococcus species , with one homolog present per genome in sequenced strains , and while they share only ~30% sequence identity , six predicted transmembrane domains and a d - e(a / g)e motif located in the loop connecting the fourth and fifth predicted transmembrane segments are highly conserved . 
 interestingly , each ayra homolog identified appears to be immediately downstream of a gene that is homologous to ayrr . 
 the downstream genes ayrb and ayrc are predicted to encode the two domains of a type 2 family abc transporter , with ayrc encoding the transporter domain and ayrb encoding the atp - binding cassette domain ( conserved domain cd03230 ) . 
 although ayra could be deleted in an otherwise wild - type strain ( n315 ) , we were unable to delete ayra in arc0001 . 
 thus , to test whether ayra is required to tolerate spase inhibition , we attempted to evolve arylomycin resistance in n315ayra . 
 as a control , we constructed and analyzed a strain lacking sa0336 , which is predicted to encode a hypothetical protein and which is not part of the ayrrabc operon . 
 high - level arylomycin m131 resistance ( > 16  g / ml ) was evolved in n315sa0336 with frequencies indistinguishable from the wild - type parental strain ( 2.0  10 ) ( 15 ) ( see table  s2  in the supplemental material ) . 
 in addition , sequencing revealed that 8 out of 8 of the resistant strains examined contained mutations in ayrr ( see table  s3  in the supplemental material ) , similar to the behavior observed with wild - type cells ( 15 ) . 
 in contrast , n315ayra developed high - level resistance with a significantly reduced frequency ( 2.9  10 ) ( see table  s2 ) , and for the single resistant clone isolated , sequencing revealed a wild - type ayrr . 
 deletion of ayrbc in arc0001 ( arc0001ayrbc ) resulted in full resensitization to arylomycin m131 , demonstrating that the abc transporter is required to tolerate spase inhibition ( see table  s2  in the supplemental material ) . 
 moreover , deletion of ayrbc in n315 ( n315ayrbc ) results in the same reduced frequency of resistance to arylomycin m131 that was observed with n315ayra ( see table  s2 ) , and again , sequencing revealed wild - type ayrr in the single resistant mutant isolated . collectively , these results demonstrate that each member of the ayrrabc operon is required to tolerate spase inhibition . 
 because derepression of ayrrabc in s. aureus confers high - level resistance to spase inhibition , we speculated that it may render spase nonessential . using the same chromosomal integration approach 
 , we attempted to delete the spase gene spsb in arc0001 and its parental wild - type strain , n315 . 
 not surprisingly , attempts to delete spsb in the wild - type strain resulted in the recovery of the wild - type sequence . 
 in addition to confirming the absence of spsb at its chromosomal locus via sequencing , we demonstrated that spsb was not present elsewhere in the genome of arc0001spsb via pcr and rt - pcr of genomic dna and rna , respectively , using primers internal to the spsb gene ( see table  s4  in the supplemental material ) . 
 deletion of spsb was also verified phenotypically via an examination of the susceptibility of n315 and arc0001spsb to gentamicin and the -lactam antibiotics cefoxitin , oxacillin , and penicillin g. previously , we and others demonstrated that the activity of these antibiotics is uniquely synergistic with that of the arylomycins ( 13 , 20 ) . as controls , we also examined susceptibilities to cccp , vancomycin , daptomycin , erythromycin , trimethoprim , and tetracycline . for each control antibiotic tested , the observed susceptibilities of n315 were virtually identical to those observed for n315 and arc0001 ( 15 ) . 
 however , the susceptibility of arc0001spsb to gentamicin and each -lactam was 8- to 64-fold greater than that of n315 or arc0001 ( see table  s5  in the supplemental material ) , consistent with the absence of spase activity . 
 we next evaluated protein secretion in n315 , arc0001 , and arc0001spsb using one - dimensional ( 1d ) sds - page ( fig .  2 ) . 
 identical patterns of secretion were observed for the wild type and arc0001 , which suggests that arc0001 still employs spase even though the ayrrabc operon is derepressed . 
 in contrast , a small but clearly significant alteration in the pattern of secretion was apparent for arc0001spsb . to confirm that this altered pattern of secretion was the result of the loss of spase activity , 
 secretion was examined in the presence of arylomycin m131 ( 4 mic ) . as expected , 
 wild - type cells showed drastically reduced levels of secretion in the presence of the arylomycin . 
 however , treatment of arc0001 cells with the arylomycin did not reduce secretion and resulted in a secretion pattern indistinguishable from that of arc0001spsb , clearly revealing that the altered pattern does indeed result from the absence of spase activity . 
 moreover , the pattern and quantity of secreted proteins observed with arc0001spsb were unchanged by the addition of the arylomycin , confirming that secretion did not depend on spase function .

 prsa is a peptidyl - prolyl isomerase involved in protein folding of secreted proteins in the extracellular environment ( 23 ) , and we previously demonstrated that it is upregulated at the transcriptional level by spase inhibition . examination of signal sequences revealed no obvious correlation with observed differences in secretion . 
 comparison of the secreted proteomes of wild - type n315 and arc0001spsb reported as the average for all detected tryptic peptides for a given protein . 
 . underlined amino acids correspond to tryptic peptides detected in arc0001spsb which contain part of the spase signal sequence .

 the ayrrabc operon corresponds to the region from position 343,418 to 345,827 in the nctc8325 chromosome . 
 the major transcriptional start site corresponds to coordinate 434,400 , which is 18  nt upstream of the gtg start codon . 
 a small number of reads corresponded to coordinate 343,248 suggesting a secondary minor promoter region further upstream . 
 overlapping rna reads were detected for the entire ayrrabc locus , suggesting that they are cotranscribed .

 the entire ayrr protein was synthesized using standard methods for boc solid - state peptide synthesis employed in our laboratory ( r. adhikary , j. zimmermann , j. liu , p. e. dawson , f. e. romesberg , j. phys . 
 , the peptide was synthesized on 0.4 mmol of p - methyl - benzhydrylamine hcl ( mbha ) resin using 2.2 mmol of protected amino acid , 4 ml 0.5 m of the peptide coupling reagent hctu ( 2.0 mmol ) , and 700 l n , n - diisopropylethylamine ( diea ) ( ~4.1 mmol ) , with a coupling time of 20 min . 
 the first amino acid , boc - lys(fmoc)-oh , was coupled onto the mbha resin , and the fmoc group was removed by reaction with 20% piperidine - dimethylformamide ( vol / vol ) ; boc groups were deprotected with neat trifluoroacetic acid ( tfa ) for 2 min . 
 an extra lysine residue was added at the c terminus of ayrr to conjugate biotin with the side chain of lysine . 
 the biotinyl - n - hydroxysuccinimide ester was generated by first dissolving 2 mmol n - hydroxysuccinimide and 2 mmol biotin in 5 ml dimethyl sulfoxide ( dmso ) and then adding 2 mmol n , n-diisopropyl carbodiimide . 
 after 30 min , the mixture was added to the resin and coupled for 1 h , followed by the addition of 2 mmol diea , which was coupled for an additional hour . 
 the peptide was cleaved from the dry resin support using anhydrous hf with 10% ( vol / vol ) anisole for 1 h at 0c . 
 the resulting polypeptide was purified via reverse - phase high - performance liquid chromatography ( hplc ) using a linear gradient of solvent a ( 0.1% [ vol / vol ] aqueous tfa ) and solvent b ( 90% [ vol / vol ] acetonitrile , 10% [ vol / vol ] water , 0.1% [ vol / vol ] tfa ) . 
 purity was assessed by analytical hplc ( a ) and mass spectrometry ( b and c ) .

 , we identify the staphylococcus  aureus operon ayrrabc ( sa0337 to sa0340 ) and show that once released from repression by ayrr , the protein products ayrabc together confer resistance to the spase inhibitor arylomycin m131 by providing an alternate and novel method of releasing translocated proteins . 
 thus , the derepression of ayrrabc allows cells to bypass the essentiality of spase . 
 we demonstrate that ayrabc functionally complements spase by mediating the processing of the normally secreted proteins , albeit in some cases with reduced efficiency and either without cleavage or via cleavage at a site n - terminal to the canonical spase cleavage site . 
 thus , ayrrabc encodes a secretion stress - inducible alternate terminal step of the general secretory pathway.importance   addressing proteins for proper localization within or outside a cell in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes is often accomplished with intrinsic signals which mediate membrane translocation and which ultimately must be removed . 
 the canonical enzyme responsible for the removal of translocation signals is bacterial type i signal peptidase ( spase ) , which functions at the terminal step of the general secretory pathway and is thus essential in wild - type bacteria . here 
 , we identify a four - gene operon in s.  aureus that encodes an alternate terminal step of the general secretory pathway and thus makes spase nonessential . 
 the results have important implications for protein secretion in bacteria and potentially for protein trafficking in prokaryotes and eukaryotes in general ."
"retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in childhood , and represents about 3% of all pediatric disease . 
 retinoblastoma , a diagnosis that affects not only vision but also survival for many individuals , is also the most common intraocular tumor of childhood . 
 the incidence of retinoblastoma is generally the same worldwide , at 1 case per 15 000 to 20 000 live births , corresponding to about 9000 cases every year . 
 the mortality rate of retinoblastoma in children is about 4070% in asia and african countries , and 35% in europe , canada , and the usa . 
 early retinoblastoma damage to the visual system may include pathophysiologic changes in the retina and corneal nerve head , and orbital corneal nerve damage . 
 therefore , we speculate that the change in or injuries of the cornea may reflect or correlate with retinoblastoma status . in this study we focused on biomarkers obtained from electroencephalography ( eeg ) recordings to reflect corneal nerve injury in retinoblastoma in the eyes - closed resting state . 
 previous studies   have also investigated corneal nerve injury in eyes of humans and animals . 
 several classical eeg biomarkers have recently been identified for predicting prognosis of retinoblastoma patients , including 5 different frequencies and powers . according to our clinical observations , eeg band power may be correlated with corneal nerve injury in retinoblastoma patients . 
 thus , in this study we compared clinical eeg recordings with cornea confocal microscope results , and explored the use of eeg in retinoblastoma patients . 
 this research was approved by the ethics committee of weifang medical university . written informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians for participation in the study . 
 twenty consecutive patients who had been referred due to retinoblastoma to the department of ophthalmology , affiliated hospital of weifang medical university between 2010 and 2014 participated in this study . 
 these 20 patients all had nonhereditary unilateral retinoblastoma presenting as intraocular tumor requiring primary enucleation . 
 retinoblastoma in this study was diagnosed according to the method of dean et al . . 
 the visual analysis was performed on standard bipolar montages with electrode positions according to the 10 to 20 international systems . 
 the detailed processes of the eeg examination were performed as reported by zeng et al . . 
 to observe the status of the subbasal never plexus , more than 3 representative images were evaluated for analysis . 
 three masked and independent investigators evaluated the morphology of the corneal nerve and the subbasal nerve plexus , performed according to a previous report . 
 the evaluation of the total length of nerve fibers represents the nerve density in the micrometers / frame ( 158 , 700 m ) . 
 we designated the number of main nerves under a microscope as the main nerve trunks . 
 we designated the number of nerve branches as the nerve branching under a microscope . using a microscope , we designated all of the nerves as the total nerves , including nerve branches and the main nerve trunks .

 a total of 20 patients ( 11 girls and 9 boys ) were included , with a median age of 58 months ( range , 43 to 127 months ) . according to the intraocular international retinoblastoma classification ( iirc ) , 
 there were 0 patients with extreme low risk ( group a ) , 1 patient with low risk ( group b ) , 1 patient with intermediate risk ( group c ) , 16 patients with high risk ( group d ) , and 2 patients with extreme high risk ( group e ) . 
 figure 1 shows the changes of the dominant power bands within delta and theta bands . 
 the eeg pattern of the retinoblastoma patients was characterized by a distinct increase in the delta ( figure 1 , p<0.01 ) and significant decrease in the theta power ( figure 1 , p<0.05 ) . 
 the results of cornea confocal observation showed that the corneal branch nerve fiber density was decreased significantly compared to the normal individuals . 
 however , the density of the tumid and dendritic nerves was significantly increased compared to the normal individuals . 
 the basal epithelium curving nerves were also significantly increased in the eyes of retinoblastoma patients ( figure 2a ) . however , the subbasal nerve plexus remained normal ( figure 2b ) . 
 these results show that the corneal nerve was significantly damaged in eyes of retinoblastoma patients . in order to investigate the correlation between corneal nerve injury and the eeg spectra power , 
 the results indicated that corneal nerve injury was positively correlated with the delta eeg spectra power ( figure 3a , p<0.05 ) and the corneal nerve injury was negatively correlated with the theta eeg spectra power ( figure 3b , p<0.05 ) . 
 this suggests that the eeg spectra power changes may reflect corneal nerve injury in retinoblastoma patients . 
 we found that the sensitivity and specificity of the increased delta power and decreased theta power in the diagnosis of retinoblastoma patients were different . in increased delta power ( delta > 3.8 ) , sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 85% , and in decreased theta power ( theta < 4.3 ) sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 80% , respectively ( table 1 ) . 
 if compounded in parallel , the sensitivity of detecting corneal nerve injury was 75% and the specificity was 88% . if compounded in series , the sensitivity and specificity were 85% and 67% , respectively ( table 1 ) , which is appropriate for the diagnosis of corneal nerve injury in retinoblastoma patients . 
 a total of 20 patients ( 11 girls and 9 boys ) were included , with a median age of 58 months ( range , 43 to 127 months ) . according to the intraocular international retinoblastoma classification ( iirc ) , 
 there were 0 patients with extreme low risk ( group a ) , 1 patient with low risk ( group b ) , 1 patient with intermediate risk ( group c ) , 16 patients with high risk ( group d ) , and 2 patients with extreme high risk ( group e ) . 
 figure 1 shows the changes of the dominant power bands within delta and theta bands . 
 the eeg pattern of the retinoblastoma patients was characterized by a distinct increase in the delta ( figure 1 , p<0.01 ) and significant decrease in the theta power ( figure 1 , p<0.05 ) . 
 the results of cornea confocal observation showed that the corneal branch nerve fiber density was decreased significantly compared to the normal individuals . 
 however , the density of the tumid and dendritic nerves was significantly increased compared to the normal individuals . 
 the basal epithelium curving nerves were also significantly increased in the eyes of retinoblastoma patients ( figure 2a ) . however , the subbasal nerve plexus remained normal ( figure 2b ) . 
 these results show that the corneal nerve was significantly damaged in eyes of retinoblastoma patients . 
 in order to investigate the correlation between corneal nerve injury and the eeg spectra power , spearman rank correlation analysis was performed . 
 the results indicated that corneal nerve injury was positively correlated with the delta eeg spectra power ( figure 3a , p<0.05 ) and the corneal nerve injury was negatively correlated with the theta eeg spectra power ( figure 3b , p<0.05 ) . 
 this suggests that the eeg spectra power changes may reflect corneal nerve injury in retinoblastoma patients . 
 we found that the sensitivity and specificity of the increased delta power and decreased theta power in the diagnosis of retinoblastoma patients were different . in increased delta power ( delta > 3.8 ) , sensitivity and specificity were 75% and 85% , and in decreased theta power ( theta < 4.3 ) sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 80% , respectively ( table 1 ) . 
 if compounded in parallel , the sensitivity of detecting corneal nerve injury was 75% and the specificity was 88% . if compounded in series , the sensitivity and specificity were 85% and 67% , respectively ( table 1 ) , which is appropriate for the diagnosis of corneal nerve injury in retinoblastoma patients . 
 the eeg method of prognosis used in this study agrees with previous reports on use of the corneal nerve for disease diagnosis and prognosis [ 1315 ] . 
 however , using eeg to diagnose corneal nerve injury in retinoblastoma patients has not been explored in previous studies . 
 the 3 goals of retinoblastoma diagnosis , treatment , and improvement are saving the patient s life , eyes , and vision . in our previous study 
 , we examined the eeg power bands and analyzed their relationship with corneal nerve injury . 
 we observed not only increased power in the prevailing eeg power bands , but also a moderate shift of the dominant frequency peak toward faster theta and delta . 
 this might be because retinoblastoma afflicts the corneal nerve , which is related with visual activity . 
 our results show that the delta power was increased and theta power was decreased in retinoblastoma patients compared to normal individuals . in clinical ophthalmology , the pathogenesis of many diseases , such as herpes simplex keratitis , glaucoma , and retinoblastoma , may affect the corneal nerves [ 5,1820 ] . 
 the cornea is the most densely innervated part of the human body , containing myelinated a and unmyelinated c fibers derived from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve . 
 therefore , corneal confocal microscope analysis is always used in the diagnosis of corneal nerve damage . 
 our results indicate decreased corneal branch nerve fiber density , as well as the appearance of the dendritic particles and tumid neurons , which suggests that retinoblastoma might induce corneal nerve injury . 
 therefore , we analyzed the correlation between corneal nerve injury and the delta and theta power of eeg . 
 the results indicated that the corneal nerve injury was positively correlated with the delta power and negatively correlated with the theta power of eeg . 
 actually , the changes in eeg theta and delta power was very slight and short - term . 
 our study indicated that the theta and delta power were mainly observed in the high - risk stage ( group d ) of retinoblastoma , according to the iirc classification and that the changes in eeg powers can not be obtained in many patients or at other stages . 
 therefore , we speculate that the changes in delta and theta power are transient and are related to iirc stage for the retinoblastoma . in our study , the sensitivity of the increased delta power and decreased theta power in the diagnosis of corneal nerve injury were 75% and 80% , respectively and the specificity was 85% and 80% , respectively . if compounded in parallel , the specificity of corneal nerve injury was 88% and if compounded in series , the sensitivity was 85% , and it was obviously higher than in other groups . 
 if this method can help determine whether the corneal nerve is already injured in retinoblastoma patients , it will provide useful a reference for follow - up , adjunctive therapy , and the prognosis of retinoblastoma patients . 
 the changes in delta and theta of eeg appear to be associated with occurrence of corneal nerve injury .

"many recent articles highlight the data revolution in healthcare , an offshoot of the vast amount of digital medical information that has now accumulated in electronic medical records ( emrs ) , and present it as an opportunity to create a  learning healthcare system. the generally proposed vision is for a population data - driven knowledge system that generalizes from every patient s life , disease and treatment experiences to impute the best course of action for diagnosis , prognosis and treatment of future patients . 
 there have also been many articles focusing on the risk that nave use of big data ( or data in general ) poses . 
 as stated by zak kohane of harvard medical school , big data in healthcare can not be a simple , blind application of black - box techniques :  you really need to know something about medicine . 
 if statistics lie , then big data can lie in a very , very big way  . 
 this paper will discuss the general issue of data in critical care with a focus on the big data phenomenon that is sweeping healthcare . with the vast amount of digital medical information that has accumulated in emrs , the challenge is the transformation of the copious data into usable and useful medical knowledge . 
 we are experiencing a rapidly expanding collection of vast amounts of clinical data from routine practice and ambulatory monitoring . 
 clinicians must already make sense of a diverse variety of data input streams in order to make clinical decisions . 
 data from our everyday activities ( financial transactions , cellphone and internet use , social media posts ) , the environment , and even the local government promise to provide even more clinically relevant information ( figure  1 ) , but to what end ? and how can increasing amounts of data be incorporated into a system of already overburdened clinicians?figure 1 
 where big data in healthcare come from ( figure courtesy of yuan lai ) . 
 
 where big data in healthcare come from ( figure courtesy of yuan lai ) . 
 the bottom line is that pertinent quality data add tremendous value , which accounts for their 
 unreasonable effectiveness. there is no way to minimize undesirable variability in practice without the data to substantiate the standardization . 
 the volume and variety of increasingly available big data can allow us to interrogate clinical practice variation , personalize the risk - benefit score for every test and intervention , discover new knowledge to understand disease mechanisms , and optimize processes such as medical decision making , triage and resource allocation . 
 clinical data have been notorious for their variable interoperability and quality , but a holistic use of the massive data sources available ( vital signs , clinical notes , laboratory results , treatments including medications and procedures ) can lead to new perspectives on challenging problems . 
 while the wetware of the human mind is a wonderful instrument for this purpose , we must design better data systems to support and improve those components of this data integration process that exceed human abilities . 
 decisions in the intensive care unit ( icu ) are frequently made in the setting of a high degree of uncertainty , and clinical staff may have only minutes or even seconds to make those decisions . 
 the increasing need for intensive care has spiked the ratio of icu beds to hospital beds as the icu plays an expanding role in acute hospital care . 
 but the value of many treatments and interventions in the icu is unproven , with many standard treatments being ineffective , minimally effective , questionably effective , or even harmful to the patient . in a setting where the effects of every intervention are subject to patient and clinical context - specific factors , the ability to use data for decision support becomes very attractive and closer to essential as increasing complexity transcends typical cognitive capabilities . 
 an example of collected data being used to infer high - level information is the icu scoring systems in use today . 
 icu scoring systems , such as apache ( acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ) , mpm ( mortality probability model ) , and saps ( simplified acute physiology score ) , are all based on the use of physiologic and other clinical data for severity adjustment ( table  1 ) . 
 while these scores are primarily used to assess and compare icu performance ( e.  g. , by examining the ratio of actual - to - predicted outcomes ) they also have use as short - hand indicators of patient acuity . but scoring system value depends not only on the accuracy of the underlying data , but also on clinical trust in the reliability of the data and the predictions based on that data . in 2012 , scoring systems were used in only 10% to 15% of us icus , despite demonstrated good discrimination and calibration .table 1

  saps : simplified acute physiology score ; mpm : mortality prediction model ; apache : acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ; auc : area under the curve ; cpr : cardiopulmonary resuscitation ; los : length of stay . in practice , clinical prediction must be motivated by the needs of clinical staff , and this must be driven in large part by perceived utility and an increase in technical comfort amongst clinicians . some of the biggest opportunities for big data to make practical gains quickly are focused on the most expensive parts of current clinical practice : reliable , predictive alerting and retrospective reporting analytics for high - cost patients , readmissions , triage , clinical decompensation , adverse events , and treatment optimization for diseases affecting multiple organ systems . 
 icu physicians have embraced the value of collecting and storing electronic clinical records , and this has led to partnerships between industrial and academic entities . 
 for example , the commercial apache outcomes database has gathered partial physiologic and laboratory measurements from over 1 million patient records across 105 icus since 2010 . the philips eicu archives data from participating icus , and 
 has collected an estimated database of over 1.5 million icu stays . as an ongoing provider , the eicu adds more than 400,000 patient records per year to its stores , and these data are also commercially available to selected researchers via the eicu research institute . 
 in contrast to these commercial databases , the multiparameter intelligent monitoring in intensive care ( mimic ) database is open and publicly accessible ( figure  2 ) . over the past decade , the mimic database 
 has collected clinical data from over 60,000 stays in beth israel deaconess medical center icus , including clinical notes , physiological waveforms , laboratory measurements , and nurse - verified numerical data .figure 2

 medicine is ultimately based on knowledge , and each of the many ways to establish knowledge has certain advantages and pitfalls . here , we focus on the randomized controlled trial ( rct ) , observational studies and what we have termed  dynamic clinical data mining  ( dcdm ) ( figure  3).figure 3 
 dynamic clinical data mining .

 emr : electronic medical record ( figure courtesy of kai - ou tang and edward moseley , from   with permission ) . 
 rcts are the gold - standard for clinical knowledge discovery . but 65  years after the first rct was published , only 1020% of medical decisions are based on rct - supported evidence . when examining the validity of a variety of medical interventions , about half of systematic reviews report insufficient evidence to support the intervention in question . 
 the reality is that the exponential combinations of patients , conditions and treatments can not be exhaustively explored by rcts due to the large cost of adding even small numbers of patients . 
 furthermore , the process of performing rcts often intentionally or inadvertently excludes groups of patients , such as those with particular co - morbidities or medications , or of certain ages or ethnic groups . 
 thus , when trying to make a real decision under practice conditions , the rct conclusions may simply not be applicable to the patient and situation in hand . 
 this was the driver for the concept of dcdm in which the user of an emr would be automatically presented with prior interventions and outcomes of similar patients to support what would otherwise be a completely subjective decision ( see below ) . 
 these include the heterogeneity of treatment effect of red blood cell ( rbc ) transfusion , the impact of pre - admission selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on mortality in the icu , the interplay between clinical notes and structured data on mortality prediction , optimization of heparin dosing to minimize the probability of over- and under - anticoagulation , long - term outcomes of minor troponin elevations in the icu   and the association between serum magnesium and blood pressure in the critically ill , to name a few . 
 but these observations may be specific to the beth israel deaconess medical center and need to be validated using databases from other institutions . 
 others have examined institution - specific databases , and these studies have yielded findings that have been translated into practice : a recent study at seattle children s compared a wide range of performance metrics and translated results into prioritized departmental and enterprise - wide improvements . 
 celi , zimolzak and stone described an operational vision for a digitally based , generalized decision support system that they termed  dynamic clinical data mining  . 
 the proposed system aggregates individual patient electronic health data in the course of care ; queries a universal , de - identified clinical database using modified search engine technology in real time ; identifies prior cases of sufficient similarity as to be instructive to the case at hand ; and populates the individual patient s emr with pertinent decision support material such as suggested interventions and prognosis , based on prior treatments and outcomes ( figure  3 ) . 
 some of the most clear - cut arguments for big data in healthcare are in conjunction with the formulation of fully digitized prevention and pharmacovigilance processes   ( figure  4 ) . 
 clinicians of the future will have to work with user friendly versions of these tools to make timely and informed decisions about the drugs their patients are receiving . in a more general sense , clinicians will have to begin to consider an individual emr as only part of a patient s record with the remainder of the record consisting of the two - way relationship of the patient s emr with the entire population database 
 . the essential starting point of the individual patient can be enhanced by the knowledge present in population - level databases , and the resulting information combinations and comparisons used to make informed clinical decisions . in turn , the information accumulated from individuals benefits the healthcare of the entire population.figure 4

 national pharmaceutical benefits manager , express scripts , can predict which patients may fail to take their medication 12  months in advance , with an accuracy rate of 98% ; ibm is modifying their famed watson system ( in tight collaboration with clinicians ) for predicting different types of cancer . 
 23andme s database has already been used to find unknown genetic markers for parkinson s disease   and myopia , and their acquisition of $ 1.3 million in national institute of health funding has shown additional confidence in their goals . 
 more recently , the open data movement has been quietly sweeping almost every industry , including the specialized domain of healthcare . 
 it calls for data sharing , and by its very nature , requires a degree of accountability as well as collaboration across disciplines never seen before . at the forefront of the open data movement in healthcare 
 glaxosmithkline ( gsk ) announced that it would make detailed data from its clinical trials widely available to researchers outside its own walls , stunning the scientific community . 
 for a company that spends $ 6.5 billion a year on research and development , it was a sharp turn away from a historic system of data secrecy . in may 2013 , 
 it then invited others to join clinicalstudydatarequest.com , where gsk and six other drug makers have already uploaded data from nearly 900 clinical trials . 
 the following month , the medical device company , medtronic , teamed up with yale university and shared its clinical trials data through the yale university open access data ( yoda ) project . 
 other important trends in open data are crowdsourcing , data marathons and hackathons , which leverage several newly available phenomena . 
 these include combining publically available , detailed , and de - identified emrs with crowdsourcing techniques and coordinated hackathons to capture , organize and integrate stakeholder user input from a necessary variety of input sources ( figure  5 ) . 
 the traditional approach to knowledge discovery involves publication in peer - reviewed journals by a very circumscribed group of contributors . 
 this process excluded a number of potentially valuable contributors , such as full time clinical physicians , nurses , medical trainees , and patients , among others.figure 5 
 beyond open big data : addressing unreliable research ( figure courtesy of kai - ou tang ) . 
 
 beyond open big data : addressing unreliable research ( figure courtesy of kai - ou tang ) . 
 hackathons are large - scale events that contemporaneously bring together ( physically and/or by teleconferencing ) large groups of qualified individuals to collectively contribute their expertise towards a common problem set . 
 crowdsourcing also focuses large groups of qualified individuals towards a common problem , but allows those individuals to do so asynchronously and in a mobile manner using phones , tablets , laptops and other devices to contribute from any location . with such tools , individual clinical encounters 
 this amalgamation of individual knowledge should allow each clinician to address gaps in their knowledge , with the confidence that their decisions are supported by evidence in clinical practice . in january 2014 , the inaugural critical data marathon and conference was held at the massachusetts institute of technology . in the data marathon , 
 physicians , nurses and pharmacists were paired with data scientists and engineers , and encouraged to investigate a variety of clinical questions that arise in the icu . over a 2-day period , 
 more than 150 attendees began to answer questions , such as whether acetaminophen should be used to control fever in critically ill patients , and what the optimal blood pressure goal should be among patients with severe infection . 
 this event fostered collaboration between clinicians and data scientists that will support ongoing research in the icu setting . 
 the associated critical data conference addressed growing concerns that big data will only augment the problem of unreliable research . thought leaders from academia , government and industry across disciplines including clinical medicine , 
 computer science , public health , informatics , biomedical research , health technology , statistics and epidemiology gathered and discussed the pitfalls and challenges of big data in healthcare . 
 the consensus seemed to be that success will require systematized and fully transparent data interrogation , where data and methods are freely shared among different groups of investigators addressing the same or similar questions . 
 the added accuracy of the scientific findings is only one of the benefits of the systematization of the open data movement . 
 another will be the opportunity afforded to individuals of every educational level and area of expertise to contribute to science . from a broader analysis of big data , we can try to understand larger patterns by comparing the strength of many signals in large populations . 
 there is a critical need for collaborative research amongst many groups that explore similar questions . 
 the association between data sharing and increased citation rate , and an increasing commitment by companies , funding agencies and investigators to more widely share clinical research data   point to the feasibility of this move . 
 the prospect of using big data in an open environment may sound overwhelming , but there have been key steps to encourage this cultural transformation . for example , the centers for medicare and medicaid services ( cms ) have begun to share data with providers and states . as the largest single payer for health care in the united states , cms has used its vast store of data to track hospital readmission rates in the medicare program ( importantly finding a rapid decline in readmission rates in 2012 and 2013 ) , and combat medicare fraud ( in its first year the system stopped , prevented , or identified an estimated $ 115 million in improper payments ) . as large amounts of shared data become available from different geographic and academic sources , there will be the additional benefit from the collection of data from sources with different viewpoints and biases . while individual researchers may not be aware of their own biases or assumptions that may impact reported results , shared exploration of big data provides us with an inherent sanity check that has been sorely lacking in many fields . 
 in a recent analysis of data - driven healthcare by the mit technology review , the authors noted that  medicine has entered its data age  . driven by the promise of an estimated $ 300 to $ 450 billion a year , companies of all sizes are beginning to fight in earnest to capture and tame the data explosion . 
 key innovations fall into three major areas : more and more data , especially resulting from mobile monitoring ; better analytics using new machine learning and other techniques ; and meaningful recommendations that focus on prediction , description , and prevention of poor health outcomes ( that are finally captured in an easily accessible format ) . 
 the mass of new data rests primarily in the proprietary hands of large entities like insurance companies and care providers . 
 for example , the genomics company 23andme is famously creating a huge database of genomic data , moving from over 700,000 records towards their goal of tens of millions . some countries with centralized healthcare systems like 
 in addition , smaller companies like welldoc   and ginger.io   are beginning to focus on rampant cell - phone penetration to get into the health - data market . 
 mobile phones can now seamlessly acquire daily patient metrics on meals , exercise , call patterns and other behaviors ; welldoc uses these data to recommend personalized insulin doses based on patients daily habits , and ginger.io monitors patients with mental illnesses for the kinds of actions that might indicate a need for help . 
 other companies provide physical attachments to mobile devices that enrich the possible data types available : cellscope sells an attachment to support remote otoscopy ; alivecor provides electrocardiogram ( ekg ) signals ; propeller health attaches to an inhaler to record pertinent data ; and there are a slew of others for nearly every imaginable data need . 
 but bigger data require better methods , and better machine learning techniques for clinical data have been a long time in coming . 
 the most intuitive argument ( that more data from which to learn can not be worse , so must be better ) is true : there have been empirical demonstrations that predictive models built from sparse , fine - grained data see marginal gains in predictive performance even to massive scale . 
 but there is another less intuitive argument for bigger data : certain rare trends or behaviors simply may not be observed in sufficient numbers without employing big data . dubbed the 
 heavy tail of data , these rare behaviors are even more difficult to observe as we add more features to our datasets . 
 intuitively , we can think of datasets as a set of samples out of a larger space ; for example , a circle inscribed within a square gets most of the area , leaving only the corners out . 
 but as we move from inscribing a circle within a square , to inscribing a sphere within a cube , the ratio of space in the corners increases   ( figure  6 ) . 
 repeat this to a higher dimension and most of the volume of the cube will be concentrated in its ( many ) corners . 
 but it is these rare instances ( sometimes appropriately referred to as  corner cases ) of behaviors or patient characteristics that machine learning can not reliably analyze with historically available data sample sizes . 
 the big data explosion is finally offering data at a scale large enough to overcome the risks of higher - dimensional spaces when working with healthcare data issues.figure 6 
 the data space and corner cases ( figure courtesy of yuan lai ) . 
 
 the data space and corner cases ( figure courtesy of yuan lai ) . 
 along with big data s promise , there have been warnings of over confidence and disaster , labelled by lazer et al . as  big data hubris 
 the warning parable told to illustrate this is google s  flu trends  . in 2008 , google launched its flu trends , which used the search terms typed into google to track the progression of influenza epidemics over time . 
 however , this approach was subsequently revealed to have suffered from several known data analysis pitfalls ( e.  g. , overfitting and concept drift ) so that by 20122013 , the prevalence of flu was being greatly overestimated . 
 other oft - cited risks include misleading conclusions derived from spurious associations in increasingly detailed data , and biased collection of data that may make derived hypotheses difficult to validate or generalize . but avoiding spurious conclusions from data analysis is not a challenge unique to big data . 
 a 2012 nature review of cancer research found reproducibility of findings in only 11% of 53 published papers . 
 there is concern that big data will only augment this noise , but using larger datasets actually tends to help with inflated significance , as the estimated effect sizes tend to be much smaller . 
 if researchers have large amounts of data that severely oversample certain populations or conditions , their derived hypotheses can be incorrect or at least understandably difficult to validate . 
 the way that current literature is designed , generated , and published creates sequential  statistically significant discoveries from restricted datasets . 
 it is not uncommon in the scientific literature to get a different story for a variable s ( vitamin e , omega-3 , coffee ) relationship to outcome ( mortality , alzheimer s , infant birth - weight ) depending on what is adjusted for , or how a population was selected . 
 there is little meaning to exploring the impact of one variable for one outcome : it is the big picture that is meaningful . 
 the benefits of the data explosion far outweigh the risks for the careful researcher . as target populations subdivide along combinations of comorbid conditions and countless genetic polymorphisms , as diagnostic and monitoring device including wearable sensors become more ubiquitous , and as therapeutic options expand beyond the evaluation of individual interventions including drugs and procedures , it is clear that the traditional approach to knowledge discovery can not scale to match the exponential growth of medical complexity . rather than taking turns hyping and disparaging big data , we need organizations and researchers to create methods and processes that address some of our most pressing concerns , e.  g. , who is in  charge of shared data , who 
 owns clinical data , and how do we best combine heterogeneous and superficially non - interoperable data sources ? we need to use big data in a different way than we have traditionally used data  collaboratively . by creating a culture of transparency and reproducibility","increasing amounts data incorporated system already overburdened cliniciansfigure big data healthcare come figure courtesy yuan lai

"a 59-year - old man presented with liver cirrhosis and esophageal varix bleeding . a ct scan 
 ( lightspeed qx / i , general electric co. , milwaukee , wi , usa ) with contrast media was performed and it incidentally revealed a horseshoe kidney with a well - enhanced isthmus and a 3-cm enhancing mass in the left part ( fig . 
 the tumor was limited to the kidney , but its extension into the renal pelvis was not definite . digital subtraction angiography 
 ( dsa ) via the right femoral artery route was performed under local anesthesia just before the embolization procedure . 
 the dsa of the aorta showed that the horseshoe kidney was fed by a five - vessel supply that consisted of both the two normal main renal arteries , two aberrant vessels that were originating from the aorta and they entered both sides of the isthmus ( fig . 
 1b ) that entered the left side of the isthmus and it originated from the left common iliac artery . 
 the dsa of the left renal artery demonstrated hypervascular tumor staining that was supplied by the anterior inferior segmental branch of the left main renal artery ( fig .

 the feeding vessel to the tumor was catheterized with the use of a 3-f microcatheter ( renegade ; boston scientific , watertown , ma , usa ) and it was embolized superselectively with contour ( 355 - 500 microns , boston scientific international , la garenne colombes cedex , france ) ( fig . 
 the contour granules were slowly and carefully injected ( to prevent reflux of the particles ) under fluoroscopic guidance before embolization with the use of a 0.018-inch - diameter tornado microcoil ( 3 mm to 2 mm , cook ) .

 the tumor site was a mild brown color and it was easily identified at the left side of the horseshoe kidney because of the previous renal artery embolization . 
 the tumor was enucleated by repeated cuts with the use of an electrosurgical generator ( valleylab inc . , boulder , co , usa ) . the parenchymal bleeding was easily controlled by suture because of the previous renal artery embolization . upon examination of the gross specimen , 
 the tumor showed as a well - circumscribed , bright yellow , solid mass measuring about 3 cm at its greatest diameter ( fig . 
 the tumor was confined to the kidney and it proved to be a renal cell carcinoma , grade 2 ( fig . 
 1f ) . a follow - up ct scan with contrast media 33 days after the operation showed a parenchymal defect at the previous tumor site with some postoperative change ( fig . 
 the horseshoe kidney is probably the most common of all renal fusion anomalies ( 3 ) . 
 this anomaly consists of two distinct renal masses lying vertically on either side of the midline ; the masses are connected at their respective lower poles by a parenchymatous or fibrous isthmus that crosses the midplane of the body ( 3 ) . 
 most of the malignant tumors arising in horseshoe kidneys are renal cell carcinomas , but transitional cell carcinomas , squamous cell carcinomas , wilm 's tumors , lymphomas , carcinoid tumors and sarcomas have also been reported ( 4 , 5 ) . 
 it has been stated that the occurrence of renal cell carcinoma in horseshoe kidneys is no higher than in non - fused kidneys , but that the incidence of transitional cell carcinoma in horseshoe kidneys is higher , and this is conceivably due to the presence of chronic urinary tract infections ( 4 ) . 
 the blood supply to the horseshoe kidney can be quite variable ( 3 ) . in 30% of the cases , it consists of one renal artery for each kidney ( 6 ) , but the blood supply may be atypical , with duplicate or even triplicate renal arteries supplying one or both kidneys ( 3 ) . 
 the isthmus and adjacent parenchymal masses may receive a branch from each main renal artery , or they may have their own arterial supply originating from the aorta either above or below the level of the isthmus ( 3 ) . 
 not infrequently , this area is supplied by branches from the inferior mesenteric artery , the common or external iliac arteries , or the sacral arteries ( 7 ) . in this case , the isthmus was receiving two arterial supplies that originated from the aorta at the level of the isthmus , and there was an additional arterial supply from the left common iliac artery ( fig . 
 an aberrant vascular supply is one of the major anatomic features in horseshoe kidneys ; thus , the vascular supply can not be easily predicted on the surgical field . 
 this is especially true when preoperative renal artery embolization is necessary and a part of the organ has to be removed due to malignant disease while the maximal amount of functioning renal tissue needs to be preserved . 
 radical nephrectomy is the standard therapy for renal cell carcinoma ( 8) . in cases of neoplasm in a horseshoe kidney , however , there is a place for limited resection or heminephrectomy , with special attention being paid to the abnormal arteries and the renal pelvis ( 8) . 
 preoperative superselective renal artery embolization helps to prevent excessive bleeding complications during organ - preserving surgery , it allows the preservation of a maximum amount of functioning renal tissue and it enables easy detection of the tumor site via the discoloration ; thus , simple enucleation is then feasible during the operation . in conclusion , preoperative superselective renal artery embolization can be an effective tool to facilitate organ - preserving surgery in a case of a horseshoe kidney with renal cell carcinoma .","dsa left renal artery demonstrated hypervascular tumor staining supplied anterior inferior segmental branch left main renal artery fig

"thymomas are the most common low - grade malignant tumors that often emerge in the 
 anterior mediastinum in adults . while 
 thymectomy by sternotomy is the traditional method of treating thymoma , recently , 
 video - assisted thoracic surgery ( vats ) approaches have been often selected . 
 vats thymectomy is reportedly feasible and 
 safe and is less invasive than transsternal thymectomy [ 2 , 3 ] 
 . however , we 
 experienced a rare complication of port - site recurrence that would not have occurred 
 with transsternal thymectomy . 
 a 60-year - old woman was referred to our hospital with an anterior mediastinal tumor on 
 computed tomography ( ct ) performed for follow - up 6 years after a complete response to 
 chemotherapy for malignant lymphoma . 
 ct revealed a tumor in the right anterior 
 mediastinum with a diameter of 3.5 cm , round shape and demarcation from the neighboring 
 tissue ( fig . 
 nmol / l ( within normal 
 range ) . to confirm the diagnosis and treat the patient , we planned tumor resection via 
 vats 
 . figure 1:initial ct revealed a tumor in the right anterior mediastinum with a diameter 
 of 3.5 cm , round shape , which was clearly demarcated from the neighboring 
 tissue . 
 initial ct revealed a tumor in the right anterior mediastinum with a diameter 
 of 3.5 cm , round shape , which was clearly demarcated from the neighboring 
 tissue . 
 the first 
 15-mm thoraco - port for the videoscope was placed in the sixth intercostal space on the 
 mid - axillary line . 
 the second 15-mm port was placed on the fifth intercostal space on the anterior axillary 
 line . 
 the third 5-mm port was placed in the fourth intercostal space on the anterior 
 axillary line . 
 the tumor was easily identified under the mediastinal pleura as an 
 elevated mass in the thymic tissue . through the second and third ports , 
 the normal thymus around the tumor was grasped by forceps and cut using an 
 ultrasonic scalpel with marginal tissues . 
 after the resected tumor was placed into a 
 specimen bag , it was removed through the second port . 
 frozen sections during the operation revealed that the 
 tumor was capsulated type a masaoka stage i thymoma with sufficient marginal tissue . 
 follow - up ct performed 36 months after the operation revealed two pleural tumors located 
 near the second and third ports ( fig . 
 initially , the operation was performed only by vats with three ports . after removing the 
 severe adhesion between the lung and chest wall 
 given these findings , we diagnosed these tumors as port - site 
 implantations after the first vats . 
 figure 2:follow - up ct at 36 months after the operation revealed two pleural tumors 
 locating at the second ( a ) and third ( b ) ports used 
 in the vats operation .

 intercostal space , and their surfaces were covered with parietal pleura with 
 partial irregularity . 
 follow - up ct at 36 months after the operation revealed two pleural tumors 
 locating at the second ( a ) and third ( b ) ports used 
 in the vats operation . in the operative findings 
 , the tumors were found to have arisen from the 
 intercostal space , and their surfaces were covered with parietal pleura with 
 partial irregularity . with no definitive findings suggesting tumor invasion into the rib 
 we performed mini - thoracotomies just above the 
 tumors and enucleated those two tumors via the mini - thoracotomies using an electric 
 scalpel . to obtain a sufficient surgical margin , we visualized the adequate resected 
 line using a thoracoscope while cutting the intercostal tissue surrounding the tumor . 
 the pathological diagnosis was type a thymoma , which was consistent with port - site 
 metastasis of the initial tumor . 
 after relating these findings and the incomplete 
 resection to the patient , we decided on close follow - up without reoperation . 
 ishibashi et al . 
 reported a case of port - site recurrence after a vats operation for type b2 thymoma 
 , to our knowledge , this is the only 
 such previous case report . the current type 
 a and the reported type b2 thymomas are 
 low - grade malignant tumors . despite their mild biological behavior , implantation at 
 cases of implantation after medical procedures have been 
 reported , not only for malignant tumors , but also for benign tumors . 
 surgeons should thus be aware that 
 port - site implantation can occur regardless of the tumor 's malignant 
 potential . 
 willard et al .   reported a case that recurred in the small 
 vats port through which partially resected lung cancer had been extracted without a 
 specimen bag . in our case , 
 the implantation developed only at the second and third 
 ports , through which the forceps and ultrasonic scalpel had passed repeatedly . 
 although 
 we did not detect any tumor exposure during the first operation , we can not help but 
 assume that the implantation occurred due to contamination with tumor cells from either 
 the ultrasonic scalpel or forceps that had grasped tissue near the tumor . 
 of further 
 note , implantation did not develop in other pleura in which tumor tissue must surely 
 have been disseminated by contaminated equipment . 
 taken together , these findings suggest 
 that one of the possible causes of port - site implantation was the rubbing of tumor 
 cells , such as thymoma , which might have a high affinity for pleura , against the vats ports . 
 surgeons should 
 take extreme care to grasp the tissue as far as possible from the tumor and to use a 
 specimen bag even when tumor exposure is not recognized . 
 given the lack of 
 any definitive clinical findings that the tumors had invaded the neighbor ribs , we 
 believed that the tumors could be enucleated completely while preserving the ribs . 
 however , the enucleation of the tumors located mainly in the narrow intercostal spaces 
 with a sufficient margin was very difficult . 
 although no definitive tumor invasion to 
 the skin or subcutaneous tissue was identified , they might nevertheless invade the ribs 
 pathologically . 
 ishibashi et al .   successfully performed a curative operation in a case of port - site 
 recurrence via wide chest wall resection and reconstruction . in the process 
 a small - extent 
 resection of the skin and wide resection of the chest wall is therefore recommended when 
 performing surgery for port - site recurrence after vats thymectomy .

 during the pathological diagnosis after the operation .

 that port - site recurrence can occur after vats resection of type a thymoma , despite 
 its mild biological behavior . 
 wide resection of the chest wall is therefore 
 recommended for operations of port - site recurrence after vats thymectomy ."
"psychobehavioral approaches attempt to identify the underlying cognitive dissonance creating the intense emotional discomfort that can trigger seizures . 
 a recent review of psychobehavioral therapy for epilepsy recommends case reports as a research design to explore specific psychological mediators of seizure self - control . 
 this case report illustrates how a psychobehavioral intervention addresses cognitive dissonance in order to decrease internal stressors of seizures and was prepared according to the consensus - based care guidelines for standardized clinical case reporting . 
 his magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) shows extensive bilateral gray matter band heterotopia ( fig .  1 ) . 
 electroclinical day- and nighttime seizures captured during video - eeg studies displayed seizures with loss of consciousness consisting of irregular shaking of his body correlating with epileptiform activity originating from bilateral parasaggital regions synchronously and tonic posturing of arms originating from the left hemisphere . before losing consciousness , he feels a loss of sensation in some of his body parts , usually starting from his right arm . 
 these findings suggest localization - related epilepsy originating from the left hemisphere and bilateral parasagittal regions with simple and complex partial as well as secondarily generalized seizures . 
 he experiences predominantly nocturnal seizures that occur in clusters of up to four complex partial seizures once or twice per week and daytime seizures once or twice per month . 
 a. 's parents had installed an acoustic monitoring device in his bedroom and reported that this baseline seizure frequency had remained unchanged for >  3  years prior to the beginning of the intervention . 
 a. is currently taking valproate , topiramate , and lamotrigine and complies with the modified atkins diet protocol . 
 past medication failures have included carbamazepine , levetiracetam , clobazam , and oxcarbazepine . during previous psychological assessments 
 , he has been diagnosed with a verbal and auditory learning disability as well as expressive language impairment . because of parental worries that challenges would increase a. 's seizure frequency , a. received parental support for doing his schoolwork , and he was never expected to contribute to household chores . as a result 
 , a. was deprived of opportunities to build his confidence in his own achievements and pictures himself as  broken 
 otherwise , a. is in good health ; he has never used alcohol or tobacco . 
 a. and his parents consented to the use of these data for this case report . 
 to resolve the resultant conflict between insecurity with his performance , fear of failure , and high expectations of himself , a. actively avoided responsibility and demanded help rather than engaging in self - reliant problem - solving behaviors . 
 this defense mechanism that incorporated learned helplessness and secondary gain issues was exacerbated by an anticipated challenge at school or social anxiety . 
 after an initial assessment period comprising two sessions of 3  h each , a treatment plan was formulated including the workbook  taking control of your epilepsy  , daily journaling , and daily relaxation exercises . 
 the participant received training in abdominal breathing and visualization techniques ( imaginary journey and an attention - focusing exercise ) to address early seizure warning symptoms . 
 the initial assessment was followed by weekly counseling sessions of 1030  min that were conducted over the phone for 12  months , and monthly sessions were conducted for a 6-month follow - up period . 
 a. engaged in a daily guided relaxation practice after returning from school and listened to a nonguided relaxation tape before going to bed . 
 he reports that he is able to interrupt warning signs of the early onset of a seizure by utilizing deep diaphragmatic breathing , visualization techniques , and self - affirmation statements of personal choice ( e.g. ,  peace and release  ) . 
 a. 's parents report that he took on responsibility for the completion of his schoolwork and studies in a self - motivated and timely fashion , all of which helped him to prevent the buildup of anxiety . after a nighttime seizure 
 , he can reliably identify the behavioral strategy which he could have employed in order to avoid the buildup of distress during the day prior to the seizure . 
 a. admitted that it was , at times , easier to have a seizure rather than to address the situational accumulation of seizure triggers by taking responsibility and implementing the appropriate proactive behaviors . 
 hence , motivational exercises were employed to allow a. to deliberately weigh the motivational factors and obstacles regarding prior set goals ( e.g. , an early bed rest ) to facilitate informed changes of his present decision - making habits . while he considered himself  broken  at the beginning of the intervention , he has developed a perspective on life in which he feels that he can shape his future according to his preferences if he follows through with taking responsibility for the acquisition of self - organizational skills ( see patient perspective in table  1 ) . by the end of the follow - up period 
 his nighttime seizures dropped to 12 clusters per month after 6  months of participating in the intervention . 
 since the internalization of the therapeutic principles is an active process that requires continuous learning , motivation , and compliance of the individual , effects are usually expected 36  months after the beginning of the intervention , especially since it takes an individual at least 12  weeks to finish the 12 sessions of the workbook . 
 this seizure frequency has remained stable during the remaining 6  months of the intervention and the 6-month follow - up period ( fig . 
 ( 3  months after the follow - up period ) , the seizure frequency has still remained the same despite increasing stressors that arise within the framework of a. 's successful admission to college . 
 the implementation of the therapeutic strategies correlated with a cessation of daytime seizures and a clinically significant drop of nighttime seizures . 
 literature suggests that seizure frequency may be positively influenced by the restoration of balance within the autonomic nervous system by the regular practice of relaxation exercises and proactive avoidance of emotional distress during wakefulness , thereby preventing the buildup of seizure activity  . 
 furthermore , a. would regularly wake up during the night when preictal or early ictal phenomena arose ; he would then react with the application of previously practiced countermeasures . 
 literature indicates that evidence for the enhancement of psychological well - being by psychobehavioral therapy is more established , while reliable evidence on its role on seizure control is scarce . 
 the a / r intervention may represent the most comprehensively developed cognitive  behavioral approach to epilepsy   that has repeatedly been correlated with a reduction of seizure frequency in individuals with complex partial seizure disorders in uncontrolled prospective and retrospective studies , , . 
 the possibility of false negative self - reports of seizure occurrence can not be ruled out but seems unlikely because the patient and his parents have been very conscientious in keeping a seizure diary for a long time . 
 because of the uncontrolled nature of a case report , nonspecific effects of attention and natural fluctuations of seizure frequency that could have contributed to improve seizure frequency can not be factored into the interpretation of the presented data . 
 however , the long and stable seizure frequency prior to the intervention makes natural fluctuations unlikely . 
 furthermore , the decreased seizure frequency has remained stable during follow - up and post follow - up with decreased and no contact with the a / r counselor which makes unspecific effects of attention implausible . 
 in this case of a 16-year - old male , the acquisition of self - organizational skills and the development of seizure interruption techniques correlated with a clinically significant drop of seizures and an increased sense of  being in control  of his seizures . the case exemplifies that motivational strategies may be applied to facilitate the regulation of lifestyle - related seizure precipitants . 
 future prospective studies are needed to further investigate the psychological mediators of an individual 's increasing sense of seizure self - control and its actual relationship with seizure frequency .

 a psychological assessment led to the working hypothesis that cognitive dissonance between fear of failure and high expectations of self had led to a  broken  self - image and active avoidance of responsibility that resulted in intense emotional distress which correlated with the occurrence of seizures . 
 this working hypothesis resulted in a treatment plan that employed the acquisition of self - organizational skills and relaxation techniques as the main therapeutic strategy .

"micrornas   ( mirnas ) are genome - encoded single - stranded rna molecules of ~22  nt in length , which play a significant role in regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes . 
 many details on biogenesis and interactions of mirnas are known ( see recent reviews , e.g. , [ 1 , 2 ] ) . 
 briefly , mirnas can be encoded by mirna genes , but also be generated from different rna transcripts ( e.g. , from introns of protein - coding genes ) . 
 plant and animal mirnas differ to some extent with respect to biogenesis and structural characteristics but also in their mode of action . in plants , 
 most if not all mirnas are transcribed from genes by rna - dependent rna polymerase ii ( polii ) into primary transcripts called pri - mirna ; these transcripts fold into ( possibly imperfect ) stem - loop structures . from the pri - mirna dicer - like ( dcl ) 
 enzymes process the stem - loop structure ( pre - mirna ) , which is usually longer ( ~130  nt ; see below ) than nonplant pre - mirna ( ~86  nt ) , and finally a mirna / mirna * duplex . in the cytoplasm 
 , the mirna is incorporated into the rna - induced silencing complex ( risc ) , and base - pairing of the mirna with complementary messenger rna ( mrna ) regions leads to mrna degradation or to inhibition of mrna translation . 
 most plant mirnas base - pair with their respective target mrnas in the coding region with perfect or near - perfect complementarity leading to cleavage ( and degradation ) of the mrnas ; animal mirnas usually base - pair with 3 untranslated regions through imperfect complementarity leading to translation repression . 
 finding of mirna genes either needs costly experimental approaches  for example , genetics , which led to the detection of the first animal mirnas [ 3 , 4 ] , cloning and sequencing of cdna , or deep sequencing  or computational prediction methods , which facilitate subsequent experimental verification or falsification . 
 the different properties of mirnas in plants and animals gave rise to different computational approaches ( for reviews see [ 57 ] ) . 
 most of these tools , however , rely on the following features : the mirna resides in a stem - loop structure , which possess a high thermodynamic stability and does not contain large internal loops or asymmetric bulges at least in the region of the mature mirna . in addition , many tools take into account a phylogenetic conservation of the pre - mirna structure and mirna sequence , which limits the chance to detect non - conserved , evolutionary new mirna genes . 
 for example , dezulian et al .   identify plant mirna homologs in a set of sequences , given a query mirna , by a sequence similarity search step and a set of structural filters ; pfeffer et al . 
 identify dna - viral pre - mirnas , which show neither detectable conservation to other viral pre - mirnas nor to host pre - mirnas , by a search for stable stem - loops and scoring of these according to free energy of folding , base composition , and number of base pairs ; wang et al .   as well as 
 jones - rhoades and bartel   search for putative mirna / mirna * complexes in the intergenic regions of   arabidopsis thaliana and filter these according to gc content , mismatches in the stem , conservation in the rice genome , and the characteristic stem - loop structure . to our knowledge , 
 the only tools for de novo prediction of pre - mirnas in plants are   hhmmir   and   triplet - svm . 
 hhmmir calculates first the mfe structure of sequence regions ( using   rnafold in a scanning window approach with window length of less than 500  nt ) , extracts stem - loops that possess at least 10 base pairs , a minimum length of 50  nt , a loop of less than 20  nt and no multiloop(s ) , and finally classifies via a hierarchical hidden markov model ( hhmm ) . 
 ( 96 sequences taken from   mirbase   5 ) and 0.973 for   a. thaliana ( 75 sequences ) . 
 triplet - svm calculates by   rnafold the mfe structure of sequences , rejects those with junction(s ) , too few base pairs , and a high free energy ( i.e. , low structural stability ) , parses the remaining structures in  triplets  ( type of nucleotide plus paired or unpaired state of the nucleotide and its two neighbors ) , and finally classifies these features with a support vector machine ( svm ) . 
 the sensitivity of   triplet - svm is published to be 0.948 for   oryza sativa and 0.92 for   a. thaliana using the same sequences from   mirbase   5 as in the test with   hhmmir . in the following , 
 we describe our tool , called   novomir , to detect pre - mirna and mirna / mirna * sequences in a plant genome . for this purpose 
 novomir uses a series of filter steps , similar to those mentioned above , followed by a statistical model to discriminate a pre - mirna from all other rnas and by another statistical model to locate the mirna / mirna * complex in a putative pre - mirna . 
 thresholds and statistical values are learned from sets of true positive sequences ( plant pre - mirnas taken from   mirbase ; ) and true non - mirna sequences ( trnas , 5 s rrna , 5.8 s rrna , mrnas , etc . ) . for detection 
 ,   novomir relies neither on comparative genomics nor on prior knowledge of a mirna target ; thus   novomir allows for searches in single plant genomes as well as in viral or viroid genomes . 
 sequences of plant pre - mirnas were obtained from different versions of   mirbase [ 15 , 16 ] : version 10.0 contains 1,247 sequences ; the recent version 14 contains 2,030 sequences . 
 the mean and median length of plant sequences are about ( 150  73 )  nt and 130  nt , respectively ( see figure s1 in supplementary material available online at doi:10.4061/2010/495904 ) ; the shortest pre - mirna is 54  nt in length ( mirbase i d : gma - mir2107 ) and the longest is 932  nt ( cre - mir916 ) . 
 the mean and median length of nonplant sequences are about ( 88  14 )  nt and 86  nt , respectively ; the shortest pre - mirna is 44  nt in length ( hsa - mir-1973 ) and the longest is 215  nt ( dme - mir-997 ) . 
 that is , most plant pre - mirnas are longer than animal pre - mirnas and their size range is more diverse . 
 the sequences of pre - mirnas and mature mirnas are slightly enriched in u   and u plus g , respectively ( see figure s2 ) . 
 the four nucleotides are not equally distributed at each position along the mirna sequences ( see figure s3 ) :   for example , a u is the preferred 5 nucleotide ( f1,u = 0.65 ) , a g on position 8 ( f8,g = 0.44 ) , and a c on position 19 ( f19,c = 0.52 ) . 
 the minimum free energy g37c of the secondary structures of pre - mirnas , as calculated by   rnafold   using default parameters , is in a wide range due to the different lengths l and g+c contents fgc of the sequences ( see figure s4 ) ; 
 normalization of g37c to length and fgc   results in g37c / l = ( 0.45  0.12 ) kcal / mol / nt and g37c / l / fgc = ( 1.02  0.26 ) kcal / mol / nt ; the latter value is significantly lower than that of other rna according to zhang et al . . 
 we used the 184 pre - mirnas and mature mirnas of   a. thaliana as listed in   mirbase version 10 as the true - positive data set for establishing all thresholds and parameters of   novomir . 
 sequences containing nucleotides other than a , c , g , u(t ) were discarded . for evaluation of sensitivity we used in addition the plant pre - mirnas and mature mirnas from   mirbase version 14 ( 190 from   a. thaliana and 1,853 from other plants ) . 
 the sensitivity of   novomir was nearly identical for both data sets ( and also with sequences from version 14  minus those from version 10 ; see supplemental table s1 ) ; thus we refrained from training with different data sets . 
 as the true - negative data set , we assembled rna sets from the following sources :   710 mrna sequences randomly selected from   a. thaliana   631 trna sequences from   a. thaliana   63 5.8 s rrna sequences from   rfam version 7.0    602 5 s rrna sequences from   rfam version 7.0   one randomly selected rna sequence from each of the 455 noncoding rna families from   rfam version 7.0 ( except mirna families ) ; 2,760 shuffled pre - mirna sequences ( each of the 184   a. thaliana sequences from   mirbase   10 was shuffled 5 times using shuffle   preserving ( a ) the mononucleotide content , ( b ) mono- and dinucleotide content , and ( c ) mononucleotide content in a window of 20  nt , resp . )   repetitive genomic elements from   a. thaliana from the repeatmasker library   ( in total 134,000  nt ) 8,000 pseudohairpin sequences from   homo sapiens    10,000 pseudohairpin sequences from   a. thaliana ; these were selected using   rnalfold from the tair cdna library   to have a minimum stem - loop length of 50  nt in a base pair span of 400  nt 10  5,000   sequences of a length between 80 and 800  nts randomly selected from the five chromosomes of   a. thaliana . 
 it relies on   rnashapes [ 24 , 25 ] and   rnalfold   ( which is part of the vienna rna package ) for secondary structure calculations . 
 rnalfold finds subsequences of a long rna sequence that fold into locally stable ( i.e. , thermodynamically favorable ) rna secondary structures ; the computational effort is (nl ) with length n of the long rna sequence and maximal base - pair separation l of the subsequences . for an rna sequence , 
 rnashapes computes shapes , which are classes of similar secondary structures , and a representative structure  shrep  of minimal free energy within each shape . 
 in the following , we describe the workflow of   novomir ( see supplemental figure s5 ) . 
 a typical plant pre - mirna consists of a relatively short sequence ( with median length ~130  nt and mean length ~150  73  nt ) that is able to fold into a stable stem - loop structure . 
 thus , we search in the genomic sequence for subsequences with locally stable secondary structure(s ) via rnalfold . in case the genomic sequence is longer than 1000  nt , we subdivide it into 1000  nt fragments overlapping by 400  nt . 
 this limit excludes only a few exceptionally long pre - mirnas ; that is , only 8 of 1356 plant pre - mirna sequences in   mirbase   10 and 14 of 2030 in   mirbase   14 , respectively , are dismissed due to this restriction for the sake of a fast first step . from the output of   rnalfold , 
 the five subsequences with best locally stable structures are treated further as individual sequences . 
 the original sequence ( with length 1000  nt ) or a subsequence ( with length 400  nt ) selected by   rnalfold is discarded if the sequence has a base composition not typical for pre - mirnas ; that is , the sequence is only retained if the fraction of each nucleotide is above 0.1 . 
 this filter rejects 9 and 21 plant pre - mirna sequences from   mirbase   10 and 14 , respectively . 
 rnashapes is used to predict the thermodynamically optimal secondary structure ( minimum free energy ( mfe ) structure with gmfe ) and the optimal secondary structure of up to three shapes with energies less favorable than that of the mfe shape class by 0.1  kcal / mol . 
 the shapes have to differ in their nesting pattern for all loop types but positions of unpaired regions are not of relevance ( rnashapes 's option   t 3 ) . 
 in general , it is assumed that the mfe structure of pre - mirnas is the conformation adequate for further processing by dicer . in our case , however , we do not know the true 5 and 3 ends ; thus , the unrelated termini of the respective sequence , which do not belong to the true pre - mirna , might cause the pre - mirna structure to be thermodynamically suboptimal . 
 moreover , the restriction by   rnashapes to the shrep prediction avoids prediction ( and further processing ) of the immense number of suboptimal structures . 
 any sequence that is not able to fold into a structure ( as predicted in step ( 3 ) ) with g37c / l / fgc  0.75  kcal / mol / nt is rejected . 
 next , each retained secondary structure is reformatted from the bracket - dot notation used by   rnashapes into an alignment - like format   ( for an example see figure 1 ) , which eases handling during the following steps : at each multiloop , the structure is divided into the respective stem - loop structures , which are separately processed further ; 5 and 3 dangling ends are removed ; a hairpin loop is removed ; and asymmetric loops are made symmetric by introduction of gap symbols . afterwards 
 each ( sub)structure consists of the following states : base pairs ( match states m symbolized by   + + ) , loop 
 ( mismatched states n ,   -- ) , and insertion ( i ) and deletion ( d ) states ( -| and   |- , resp . ) . 
 a stem - loop shorter than 30 states in the alignment - like format is deleted . for efficiency of this filter , 
 next , a window of length 25 states is moved ( in steps of ( 1 ) state ) along the structure in the alignment - like format , and the fraction of base - paired states is determined for each window . 
 a stem - loop is deleted unless at least a mean fraction of 0.65 base - paired states is present in five different windows , which might overlap . for efficiency of this filter see figure 2(b ) . 
 a stem - loop is deleted if it does not contain a helix with at least 8 consecutive base pairs . for efficiency of this filter 
 a stem - loop is deleted if the ratio of its sequence length ( as predicted by   rnalfold ) and the length of the stem - loop in the alignment - like format is above 6 ; that is , the structure contains too many junctions and/or large , unstructured hairpin loops . for efficiency of this filter 
 if a sequence ( and structure ) remains after the filter steps ,   novomir decides on its possibility to be a pre - mirna using a paired hidden - markov model identical to that described by nam et al . . 
 briefly , the joint probability p(x ,  ) of an observed sequence x and a state sequence  is 
								 ( 1)p(x, )  =  t01i=1lei(xi)ti,i+1 , 
							 with transition probabilities tkl = p(i = l | i1 = k ) between the four states k , l  { m , 
 n , i , d } , emission probabilities ek(b ) = p(xi = b | i = k ) of the different nucleotide and gap pairs b , window size l = 21 , and the probability of starting in state k defined as t01 . 
 in contrast to nam et al . , we use four hidden states ( is_mirna , is_mirnais_not_mirna , is_not_mirnais_mirna , is_not_mirna ; see figure s6 ) . for the decision that the sequence is a pre - mirna or not , the values for the j  is_mirna , is_not_mirna } states are normalized and summed up 
								 ( 2 )  pj=i  =  1lei , j(xi , j)ti , j,i+1,jj=14ei , j(xi , j)ti , j,i+1,j . 
 the squared ratio 
								 ( 3)r1  =  ( pis_mirnapis_not_mirna)2 , 
							 as well as the mean of the nine highest values of the difference 
								 ( 4)r2  =  max  k = ll+20pis_mirnapis_not_mirna , 
							 are compared to thresholds for the pre - mirna decision . in case of a positive decision in the previous step , 
 the values that lead to the six highest values of r2 are predicted as positions of probable mirna / mirna * duplices ( see figure 1(c ) ) . 
 our programnovomir uses a set of heuristic filters and a statistical model    to discriminate a mirna precursor from all other rnas ( see figure s5 ) . 
 the data for this model are collected based on a set of true positive sequences ( mirna precursors from   a. thaliana as in   mirbase   10 ) and a set of true non - mirna sequences ( for details , see section 2.3 ) .   all thresholds for the filter steps and the probabilities for the hidden - markov model were selected on the basis of  receiver operating characteristic  ( roc ) curves like those shown in figure 2 . for these , 
 the set of true positive   a. thaliana pre - mirna sequences was taken from   mirbase version 10 . 
 sensitivity values for the enlarged set of pre - mirnas from   mirbase version 14 ( 190   a. thaliana and 1,840 sequences from other plants ) are compared to those obtained from   mirbase version 10 ( 184   a. thaliana and 1,063 sequences from other plants ) in table 1 . 
 the sensitivity values of   novomir for   a. thaliana pre - mirna sequences of both   mirbase versions are very close to each other ( 0.837 and 0.832 , resp . ) . 
 the values for all plant pre - mirna sequences are slightly lower ( 0.791 and 0.792 , resp . ) , but show no clear trend that sequences of   mirbase   14 ( not present in   mirbase   10 ) are different from those of   mirbase   10 or that sequences from a certain taxonomic group might be different from those of others ( see supplemental table s1 ) . 
 the sensitivity of   novomir in predicting the position of the mirna / mirna * complex is also high ( 0.73 for   a. thaliana and 0.82 for all plants ; see table 1 ) . for this , a position is counted as correctly predicted if it matches exactly the annotated mature mirna or overlaps by five or fewer nucleotides . 
 we tested   hhmmir   and   triplet - svm   for sensitivity with the sequences from   mirbase   10 and 14 ( see table 1 ) . 
 the filtering steps of both tools reject already many sequences ( hhmmir more than 80% and   triplet - svm more than 22% ) . 
 for the sequences remaining after the filtering steps , the sensitivity of the hhmm and svm is at maximum 0.79 and 0.60 , respectively , which is also lower than that of   novomir with a sensitivity of at least 0.80 ( using all filter steps ) . 
 these data sets should not contain any true ( pre-)mirna . for example , we used well - annotated rnas ( mrna , noncoding rna ) and sets of  pseudohairpins  from   h. sapiens and   a. thaliana . 
 similarly , the chance is negligible that the data set of 10  5,000 sequences randomly selected from the   a. thaliana genome contains a true mirna . 
 the most difficult data set consisted of   a. thaliana mrnas ; with these   novomir reached a specificity of 0.975 ( see table 2 ) . with 
 we wanted to test the program with a more realistic scenario , given the satisfying sensitivity and specificity values of   novomir with our test data ( see tables 1 and 2 ) . 
 we selected all intergenic and intronic regions of the   a. thaliana genome from  the arabidopsis information resource 
 ( tair ) , removed all pre - mirna sequences , and searched within the remaining sequences for potential pre - mirnas via novomir . 
 novomir classified 828 sequences from the 30,413 intergenic sequences and 649 sequences from the 148,558 intronic sequences , respectively , as potential pre - mirnas . despite this 
 pleasingly low numbers of hits , however , an interpretation of this outcome is not easy . to get an impression on the hits 
 , we searched with these potential pre - mirna sequences with   blast for any annotation and for the mirna - typical expression pattern in the  arabidopsis small rna project database  ( asrp ) [ 28 , 29 ] ; such a typical expression pattern of a pre - mirna includes sequences for the mirna as well as for the mirna * ( for an example see supplemental figure s7 ) . to our surprise 
 , we detected that some of the predicted candidates are already described as true pre - mirnas . 
 an example of such a sequence , predicted by   novomir as a potential pre - mirna , is located on   a. thaliana chromosome 3 in the region between genes at3g09280 and at3g09290 . 
 its secondary structure and its support by expressed small rnas are shown in figure 3 and figure s8 , respectively . 
 it is already known as pre - mir2111a [ 30 , 31 ] , but not present in   mirbase   14 . 
 the sequences of the mature mir2111a and of mir2111a * predicted by   novomir also coincide with the sequences given in .   in the following , we mention shortly three further candidate hits , for which we found some support by small - rna expression in the asrp but no explicit annotation . 
 one   novomir hit is located on chromosome 4 between at4g22760 and at4g22770 close to the 3 terminus of the latter , but on the opposite strand ; for further details , see figure 3 and figure s9 . 
 the next hit ( see figure 3 and figure s10 ) is located in between at5g52689 and at5g52690 . 
 the last mentioned hit is located in an intron of at1g01650 , which encodes for an aspartic - type endopeptidase / peptidase ; the structure of this sequence is shown in figure 3 and the expression pattern of the genomic region in figure s11 . 
 it is known that many mirnas are induced by biotic and abiotic stress [ 3638 ] . 
 thus , a lack of small rnas might either point to a false - positive prediction or to a stress condition not analyzed for expression of small rnas . 
 further candidate hits are located in regions showing expression patterns similar to those of repetitive elements . 
 a recently published review   discussed the possibility that some mirnas could be evolved from repetitive genomic elements and/or duplication of genomic regions . 
 viroids are plant - infectious , noncoding , unencapsidated , circular rnas that are transcribed in a rolling - circle mechanism either in nuclei ( pospiviroidae ) or in chloroplasts ( avsunviroidae ) of infected plants . 
 viroids cause the production of viroid - specific small rnas ( vsrna ) similar in size to small interfering ( sirna ) and mirnas , but they do escape the cytoplasmic silencing mechanism . a positive ( or negative )   novomir prediction of viroids as potential pre - mirnas would point to the genesis of vsrnas . for further details , see recent reviews [ 4043 ] . 
 potato spindle tuber viroid ( pstvd ) is the type strain of   pospiviroidae . because of its high self - complementarity the circular pstvd rna folds into a rod - like secondary structure of high thermodynamic stability ( see figure 4 ) . 
 this structure can be divided into five structural domains on the basis of homology between different pospiviroids . 
 most sequence variants or strains of pstvd differ by mutations in the pathogenicity - modulating ( p ) domain and/or variable ( v ) domain . 
 only a few nucleotide changes in the p domain are sufficient to exhibit remarkably different symptoms in infected tomato plants   solanum lycopersicon cv rutgers . 
 if this p domain would be the source of mirna - like vsrnas , these could interfere somehow with the host 's metabolism leading to symptom production . 
 for an rna with pstvd sequence from positions 263359/196 , which is one of the structural elements present during processing of   ( + ) -strand replication intermediates to circles ,   novomir predicted mirna / mirna * complexes in the p domain of pstvd ; for an rna from positions 103255 , which is also a structural elements during processing ,   novomir predicted a further mirna / mirna * complex in the tr domain , but only after lowering the normalized energy threshold from the default value tg / l / fgc = 0.75 to 0.69 . 
 novomir predicted identical positions for complexes in a full - length , linear pstvd ( 1359 ) . 
 especially the prediction of vsrnas derived from the p domain supports an involvement of vsrnas in symptom production via vsrna - induced ( mis)regulation of plant - endogenous rnas like mrnas coding for transcription factors . 
 this hypothesis is supported by deep - sequencing of pstvd - derived vsrnas in pstvd - infected tomato plants ( diermann , matouek , teune , riesner and steger , submitted ) and sequencing of vsrnas produced   in vitro by dcl processing of pstvd   which showed clusters of vsrnas derived from the p domain . 
 in contrast , [ 45 , 46 ] found only vsrnas in pstvd - infected tomato plants that clustered in regions outside of the p domain . 
 this discrepancy is unresolved but might be based for example on different purification procedures of the vsrnas . 
 plant pre - mirnas are more heterogeneous in size and structure than animal pre - mirnas but still show sufficient characteristic features  such as relative thermodynamic stability of their structure , length of helices , and number and size of loops  to be differentiated from other rnas . 
 based on several of these features , we developed a series of filter steps and a statistical model that together are able to detect pre - mirnas with a sensitivity of about 0.8 and a specificity of about 0.99 . 
 thus , the program , which we call   novomir , is well suited to search on a genomic scale for new pre - mirnas that are not necessarily evolutionarily conserved . as an example , we searched with   novomir for pre - mirnas in nontranslated regions of the   a. thaliana genome and detected among the high - scoring sequences experimentally verified pre - mirnas , which were not annotated in the recent version of   mirbase 
 . additionally ,   novomir recognizes viroids as pre - mirnas , which supports the hypothesis that viroid - specific small rnas are generated in a mirna - like pathway .","pri mirna dicer like dcl enzymes process stem loop structure pre mirna usually longer nt see nonplant pre mirna nt finally mirna mirna duplex

 as primary mirnas ( pri - mirna ) from eukaryotic genomes . 
 at least in plants , their 
 regulatory activity is mediated through base - pairing with protein - coding messenger rnas 
 ( mrna ) followed by mrna degradation or translation repression . 
 we describe novomir , a program for the identification of mirna genes in plant 
 genomes . 
 it uses a series of filter steps and a statistical model to discriminate a pre - mirna 
 from other rnas and does rely neither on prior knowledge of a mirna target nor on 
 comparative genomics . 
 the sensitivity and specificity of novomir for detection of premirnas 
 from arabidopsis thaliana is ~0.83 and ~0.99 , respectively . 
 plant pre - mirnas 
 are more heterogeneous with respect to size and structure than animal pre - mirnas . despite 
 these difficulties , novomir is well suited to perform searches for pre - mirnas on a 
 genomic scale .

"in the year 2003 immunosuppressive therapy using mitoxantrone has been approved for treatment of patients with worsening relapsing - remitting or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis ( ms ) in germany . 
 due to potential side effects on the heart and   bone marrow the cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was initially limited to 100  mg / m and later on extended to 140  mg / m in selected cases . 
 however , systematic data on the course and incidence of cardiac toxicity following low - dose mitoxantrone are lacking . in the following , 
 we report about serial cardiac evaluation in 30 consecutive patients before , during , and after mitoxantrone treatment in consecutive patients with ms . in the years 2006 and 2008 , 
 parts of the study have been published in german language in journals which are not indexed by pubmed [ 1 , 2 ] . 
 from january 2003 to july 2004 , thirty consecutive patients with secondary progressive or worsening relapsing multiple sclerosis were treated with mitoxantrone at 3-month intervals . 
 it was agreed among the participating physicians that termination of treatment due to cardiac reasons was limited to clinical heart failure only . 
 mitoxantrone infusion as well as   cardiac evaluation before , during , and after treatment was performed by a cardiologist . 
 all patients were treated   ambulatory and received a pneumococcal vaccination before treatment was initiated . in the following we focus on the cardiac evaluation of mitoxantrone infusion . prior to each treatment , all patients underwent a careful history taking , laboratory testing , a resting electrocardiogram ( ecg ) , and a transthoracic cardiac ultrasound . on all occasions , mitoxantrone at a dose of 12  mg / m diluted in 250  ml saline was infused over a period of 30 minutes . 
 the electrocardiogram was obtained by a digital 12-channel system ( custo cardio 130 , ottobrunn ) in recumbent position . 
 cardiac imaging was performed using a digital ultrasound system ( vivid 3 , general electrics , solingen ) . 
 cardiac chamber measurements ( mm ) , calculation of fractional shortening ( fs% ) , and respective ejection fraction ( ef% ) were done on m - mode images only ; values were determined as an average of three consecutive measurements . 
 global assessment of cardiac function and valvular disease was performed on two - dimensional views . 
 the relation between ef , fs , lvedd , and heart rate with the cumulative mitoxantrone dose was analyzed using linear regression analysis   with random coefficients ( software sas 9.1 , proc mixed ) . 
 the course of each patient was linearly modeled and the population average ( trend ) estimated respecting age and gender . 
 30 consecutive patients ( 23 female , 7 male ) with a mean age of 47  10 years were treated with mitoxantrone . no patient had received mitoxantrone , a mediastinal radiation , or any cancer treatment before the present mitoxantrone therapy . 
 three patients suffered from noninsulin - dependent diabetes ( 10% ) , 2 patients from essential hypertension ( 7% ) , and 4 patients from depression . 
 prior to mitoxantrone treatment 8 patients had been treated with interferon ( 27% ) , 3 with azathioprine ( 10% ) , 1 with glatiramer acetate ( 3% ) , 2 with interferon and azathioprine ( 7% ) , 1 with glatiramer acetate and interferon ( 3% ) , and 1 with immunoglobulins ( 3% ) . in 4/30 patients 
 mitoxantrone therapy had been started during hospitalization elsewhere ( 9 courses ) and continued mitoxantrone treatment as all other 26 patients ambulatory . 
 all reported data refer to the data obtained in all 30 patients during ambulatory treatment only . 
 mitoxantrone was infused 222 times with a mean cumulative dosage of 83    37  mg / m ( minimal dose 24  mg / m , maximal 156  mg / m ) . 
 treatment frequency ranged from 2 to 13   infusions per patient and extended over a mean period of   23  13 months ( minimal 3 , maximal 53 months ) .   during therapy with mitoxantrone 3 patients ( 10% ) experienced an acute episode of relapsing symptoms , one after the first course , one after the 4th , and one after the 5th course of mitoxantrone . in two of these 3 patients , 
 an additional high - dose course of intravenous steroids was administered . at the terminal mitoxantrone infusion   5/30 ( 17% ) 
 reported about amelioration of ms symptoms as compared to symptoms at the start of therapy , 19/30 ( 63% ) about no change , and 6/30 ( 20% ) about worsening symptoms . 
 out of 30 treated patients a total of 19 patients ( 63% ) had one or more cardiac exams following termination of mitoxantrone infusion . 
 the followup extended over a mean period of   30  14 months ( minimal 6 , maximal 56 months ) . at the start of mitoxantrone therapy , 
 history taking and a careful exam revealed no cardiac disease in any patient . during and after mitoxantrone treatment no patient developed cardiac failure or was hospitalized for any reason . 
 resting ecg was normal before , during , and after mitoxantrone treatment in all patients . 
 mean heart rate averaged 77  11  rpm before treatment and did not change significantly during and after mitoxantrone treatment ( table 1 ) . whereas heart rate and left end diastolic dimension did not change significantly during and after therapy , fractional shortening ( fs ) as well as ejection fraction ( ef ) decreased continuously and statistically significantly during mitoxantrone treatment in the study population of 30 patients ( table 1 ) . during followup of 19 patients , cardiac pump function 
 as determined by    fs and ef did not recover ( figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) for 19 patients during and after treatment ) . 
 in contrast , 2d echocardiography did not reveal any visible deterioration of global left ventricular function . 
 apart from therapy - related acute leukemia , cardiac pump failure   is considered as the most serious side effect [ 3 , 4 ] .   according to published reports   mitoxantrone cardiotoxicity occurs infrequently ; however , this problem has not been assessed systematically . in some studies 
 cardiac function and respective ejection fraction have been evaluated by various different methods   . in other smaller studies , 
 cardiac function has been addressed only before and at the end of treatment leaving the results subject to alpha and beta errors .   in the present study , 
 cardiac function has been explored systematically and serially allowing for longitudinal intraindividual observations of cardiac function . in 30 patients treated with mitoxantrone at a mean dosage of 83  37  mg / m , left ventricular pump function decreased continuously without clinical signs of heart failure . following termination of treatment , cardiac function 
 did not recover , suggesting a long - lasting toxic effect of mitoxantrone on the heart . 
 our findings are supported by publications of avasarala et al .   and pattoneri et al . 
 but contrast with studies of de castro et al .   and zingler et al .   who found no decline in left ventricular function during serial assessment using echocardiography . 
 based on   numerous reports of early and late onset cardiotoxicity in individuals with low - dose mitoxantrone and our observations of dose - dependent effects on the heart , serial determination of cardiac function in each patient seems indicated . 
 although cardiac pump function and respective ejection fraction can be determined by various methods , transthoracic echocardiography is cost - effective and available everywhere ; radionuclide studies or magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved to selected patients with questionable results . whether   ejection fraction is calculated linearily using m - mode echocardiograms or volumetrically using planimetry of monoplane or biplane projections in patients with suspected nonischemic cardiomyopathy is of minor importance as long as the reevaluation monitoring employs the same method throughout the course of chemotherapy and its followup . 
 apart from the evaluation of systolic cardiac pump function by echocardiography , repetitive careful history taking and   the serial determination of brain natriuretic petide may guide the followup . 
 parameters of   impaired relaxation and respective abnormalities in diastolic filling of the heart may precede reductions in systolic pump function and respective ejection fraction , in patients receiving chemotherapy . on the basis of the current paper , we suggest to inform the patient about the potential insidious nature of cardiac toxicity and to monitor cardiac function in every patient prior and , systematically , during mitoxantrone therapy . 
 it seems that cardiac function does not deteriorate further when mitoxantrone therapy has stopped . in future studies , 
 it should be tested by longitudinal serial analysis whether pretreatment with dexrazoxane will limit the slow decline of left ventricular function as has been reported by bernitsas et al .   .","following report serial cardiac evaluation consecutive patients mitoxantrone treatment consecutive patients ms

"according to the who , over 3 000 000 children under the age of five die each year due to 
 causes related to environmental risk factors . identification of recognized environmental health risk factors 
 is considered to be one of the most important objectives of health policy , as it relates to 
 the everyday work of medical health - care professionals including family doctors , 
 pediatricians , and nurses . 
 determination of mentioned risk factors will allow implementation 
 of proper preventive measures , and a system of providing parents and teachers with 
 information about health risks will , in turn , decrease the risks which may improve the effectiveness of health care . 
 the who green page questionnaire was designed as a potential tool to determine and monitor 
 children s environmental conditions in all places where they live and develop . 
 it can be a 
 valuable source of supplemental information acquired in the course of children s and 
 parents appointments with family physicians , and it may also be a great support for doctors 
 in determining children s environmental risks at home and school . 
 the who green page questionnaire has not yet been analyzed in terms of its practical 
 utility with respect to medical diagnostics . the expected goal of this research was to assess the possibility of implementation of the 
 who green page as a tool to supplement basic medical interviews with potential environmental 
 health risk factors for children and determination of real risk factors currently existing 
 in home and school environments . 
 the who green page questionnaire was implemented with parents of children from urban , 
 suburban , and rural environments who visited a family practice doctor . 
 due to exclusion of questionnaires 
 missing the majority of data ( more than 50% of the answers were missing ) , the responses of 
 159 patients were analyzed . when we analyzed the questionnaires with less than 50% of the 
 questions unanswered , the denominator for percentage calculation was lower than that for the 
 159 parents . 
 wilk test was carried out . for measurable ( quantitative ) 
 variables , arithmetic means , and standard deviations 
 were calculated , while for qualitative 
 variables , the frequency ( percentage ) was determined . 
 the analysis of qualitative variables 
 was based on contingency tables and the  test . to compare quantitative 
 variables in two non - related and related groups , 
 wallis test was conducted for means of variables that did not meet 
 the criteria for variance analysis . 
 in total 159 parents took part in the study , including 87 parents of girls ( 58% of the 
 examined ) and 63 parents of boys ( 42% of the examined ) . 
 the average age of the children was 
 11.2 years ( sd 6.2 , median 11 ) . 
 the children mostly lived with both parents ( 91.3% , 136 ) , 
 while 6.7% ( 10 ) of them lived with their mothers only . 
 the majority of the examined cases 
 came from urban areas ( 56.2% , 87 ) , while 38.3% ( 59 ) and 5.2% ( 8) were from rural and 
 suburban areas respectively ( p<0.05 ) . 
 overpopulation at home was noted only among 4.4% ( 7 ) of the 
 respondents . 
 domestic animals were present around the homes of 74.5% ( 117 ) of the respondents , and the 
 distribution of answers was statistically significant ( p<0.05 ) , as it relates to the 
 child s place of living . 
 contact with domestic animals was predominant in rural areas 
 ( animals were present in 91.53% of cases ) as opposed to urban and suburban areas ( 63.95% and 
 57.14% respectively ; p<0.05 ) . 
 it was noted that 24.3% ( 34 ) of caregivers expressed concern about their children s 
 environment ( vs 75.7% , 106 ) , which did not maintain statistically significant dependency 
 with the children s living environment ( p>0.05 ) . 
 knowledge and awareness of particular 
 existing environmental risks were noted in 23.7% ( 32 ) of the subjects . 
 most of the respondents ( 96.2% , 153 ) were aware of the presence of disease - transmitting 
 factors : 42.5% of the subjects knew disease - transmitting factors . 
 the distribution of the 
 answers to this question was dependent on the children s living environment  it was 
 distinctively different in rural areas ( disease - transmitting factors were identified by 
 64.3% of the examined ) as opposed to urban and suburban areas ( correct answers were given by 
 31.4% and 33.3% the examined respectively ) , p<0.05 . 
 in addition 7.0% ( 11 ) of the surveyed stated that their children had sustained injuries in 
 connection with road traffic prior to the questionnaire study , and one child had sustained 
 injuries in connection with fire . 
 the distribution of the answers to those questions was not 
 dependent on the children s living environment ( p>0.05 ) . 
 existing exposure to chemical substances ( pesticides and detergents ) was confirmed by 5.2% 
 ( 8) of the respondents , and 6.4% ( 10 ) of the respondents reported that their children had 
 been poisoned before the questionnaire as a result of contact with chemical substances . 
 furthermore , 9.6% ( 15 ) maintained that there existed a threat from poisonous animals . 
 the 
 distribution of the answers to the questions about contact with chemical substances and 
 threat from poisonous animals was not dependent on the children s living environment 
 ( p>0.05 ) . 
 following analysis of the respondents answers , it was determined that the examined 
 children lived in a densely built - up area in 79.6% ( 125 ) of the cases and in a low - risk

"neurodegenerative conditions , such as dementia , multiple sclerosis ( ms ) , parkinson s disease , and huntington s disease , are often characterized by significant neuro - psychological deficits that interfere significantly with patient s abilities and quality of life.14 cognitive impairment is a common feature in ms affectin43%72% of patients5,6 and is characterized as other signs and symptoms of the disease by variability and heterogeneity . however , dementia is rare , and the more common clinical presentation is one of the specific and subtle cognitive deficits.7 the most frequently affected cognitive functions are attention , speed of information processing , memory , executive functions , and visuospatial abilities,8 although new domains such as theory of mind have also been identified.9 involvement of cognitive functions such as language , praxis , and gnosis is rare and less well studied . 
 the influence of the duration of the illness on cognitive functioning is still a matter of controversy . 
 as regards clinical presentation , the progressive forms of ms ( both secondary progressive ms and primary progressive ms ) are more involved in both degree and altered domains as compared to relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis ( rrms).10,11 some authors point out that impairments are almost invariably a complication of the later stages of the disease when there is axonal loss with the involvement of large areas of white matter , disconnection between several cortical areas of association , and disconnection between cortical and subcortical areas , but impaired cognitive function appears to be present even in the early stages of the disease . 
 studies with long - term follow - up indicate that cognitive function decreases as the disease progresses.12,13 the degree of neurological impairment is shown as a predictor of cognitive decline in the follow - up studies.14 in the case of fatigue , this can interfere negatively , especially in tasks that require sustained mental effort such as working memory tests or sustained attention.15 neuropsychological dysfunction severely affects the patients lives16 in terms of their ability to keep their jobs,17 and they require greater assistance with daily living activities . 
 cognitively compromised patients are also more likely to have problems with socialization than cognitively intact ms patients.18 cognitive impairment has been associated with nonsomatic symptoms of depression in rrms , and this finding supports the importance of evaluating depressive symptoms when cognitive impairment is suspected in patients with rrms.19 anxiety has been less studied than depression in ms patients , although there is evidence that high levels of anxiety are associated with poor performance in cognitive tasks , especially processing speed , working memory , and visual  spatial memory.20,21 this study was conducted in lanzarote , the easternmost landmass of the canary islands , spain ( figure 1 ) . 
 the only study of the prevalence of ms on this island was published in 1980s , which reported a low prevalence of 15/100,000.22 the population of the island at that time was 60,000 inhabitants , and the authors concluded that the rate was higher than expected because of the geographical situation of the island . 
 more recently , a study presented at the lxv annual meeting of the spanish society of neurology identified a total of 70 patients with ms on the island . 
 this figure gives a prevalence of 49/100,000.23 other epidemiological studies conducted in the region have found that the canary islands is a medium - to - high risk area like spain and other mediterranean countries.24,25 thus , the canary islands , despite being closer to the equator , are still a medium risk area . 
 the aim of this study was to describe the extent and pattern of the involvement of cognitive impairment and the psychological status in all patients of a ms cohort . 
 a study of the full ms population , which rules out a possible selection bias , should provide a more comprehensive view of the cognitive impairment spectrum in ms . 
 the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee for clinical research of the university hospital of the canary islands and the medical director of hospital doctor jos molina orosa . 
 the study was conducted in accordance with the declaration of helsinki.26 all patients signed written informed consent . 
 seventy patients with ms or clinically isolated syndrome ( cis ) treated at the doctor jos molina orosa hospital in lanzarote ( the hospital sees all the ms or cis patients on the island ) and 56 healthy controls ( hcs ) matched by sex , age , and schooling were included in the study . 
 the inclusion criteria for the patients were as follows : 
 willing and able to sign written informed consent;ms diagnosed according to the mcdonald criteria 200527 or cis ; andneurologically stable ms ( with no evidence of relapse or steroids treatment in the last 4 weeks preceding the enrollment ) .

 no history of psychiatric or neurological disorders and no history of drug abuse or any major medical illness . 
 six patients did not participate in the study : three patients were not on the island at the time , one patient could not attend due to severe physical disability , and two patients refused to participate in the study . the spanish version of the brief repeatable battery of neuropsychological test ( brb - n)6 is used to assess the cognitive status of all the participants . 
 the brb - n includes the following tests : 
 selective reminding test ( srt)28 as a measure of verbal learning and delayed recall . 
 this test gives three different scores : srt - long - term storage ( srt - lts ) , srt - consistent long - term retrieval ( srt - cltr ) , and srt - delayed ( srt - d).10/36 spatial recall test ( spart ) , an extended version of the original form the 7/24 spart to assess visuospatial learning and delayed recall.29 this test gives two scores : spart - total and spart - delayed ( spart - d).symbol digit modalities test ( sdmt)30 as a measure of complex attention and processing speed.paced auditory serial addition test ( pasat)31 as a measure of sustained attention and working memory.controlled oral word association test32 as a measure of verbal fluency . 
 this test gives three different scores : srt - long - term storage ( srt - lts ) , srt - consistent long - term retrieval ( srt - cltr ) , and srt - delayed ( srt - d ) . 
 10/36 spatial recall test ( spart ) , an extended version of the original form the 7/24 spart to assess visuospatial learning and delayed recall.29 this test gives two scores : spart - total and spart - delayed ( spart - d ) . 
 symbol digit modalities test ( sdmt)30 as a measure of complex attention and processing speed . paced auditory serial addition test ( pasat)31 as a measure of sustained attention and working memory . 
 the multiple sclerosis neuropsychological questionnaire ( msnq),33 the hospital anxiety and depression scale,34 and the fatigue severity scale35 were administered to the patients . 
 all evaluations were performed by a neuropsychologist who was an expert in ms and familiar with the administration of all tests . 
 these tests were administered in a single session of ~1 hour . a z score ( direct score mean / standard deviation [ sd ] ) was created for each cognitive domain according to standard practice to obtain a global cognitive - performance score . 
 verbal  memory = z - lts+z - cltr+z - srt - d3(1 ) 
 visuospatial  memory = z - spart  total+z - spart - d2(2 ) 
 processing  speed = z - total  correct  responses  of  sdmt(3 ) 
 working  memory = z - total  correct  responses  of  pasat3+pasat22(4 ) 
 verbal  fluency = z - semantic+z - phonetic  total  correct  responses2(5 ) finally , a global cognitive function score ( z - global ) was obtained by calculating the mean of the z scores from the five cognitive domains . 
 different cognitive impairment criteria were used : < 1.0 sd , < 1.5 sd , and < 2.0 sd ( compared to the cg ) in one , two , or three subtests of the battery , respectively . 
 interviews were also conducted with family members about their level of functionality ( food preparation , medication management , use of money , travel outside home ) in the case of patients with suspected dementia . 
 dementia was diagnosed following the fourth edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders , text revised ( dsm - iv - tr).36 categorical variables were expressed as frequencies and percentages . 
 all the variables analyzed followed a normal distribution except pasat 3 , and the scores were log transformed before analysis of covariance . 
 analysis of covariance was performed , including cognitive domains such as dependent variables and controlling for age and schooling . 
 correlation between the cognitive domains and the patient s clinical variables and questionnaires were assessed using the pearson s correlation test . 
 statistical analysis was performed with spss v20.0 software ( ibm corporation , armonk , ny , usa ) . 
 p - values were corrected for multiple testing problem using the bonferroni correction method ( /k : 0.05/6=0.008 ) , considering p - values < 0.008 as statistically significant .

 table 1 shows the clinical and demographical characteristics of hc ( n=56 ) and patients ( ms ; n=60 ; both groups had similar distributions of sex , age , and schooling ) . 
 the patients scored less than controls , in the controlling for age and schooling , on all variables of the brb - n except visuospatial memory ( table 2 ) . 
 a high prevalence of cognitive impairment ( 75.0% ) was obtained when using a lenient criterion ( < 1.0 sd in one sub - test ) . 
 the prevalence was 35.0% with a moderately stringent criterion ( < 1.5 sd in two subtests ) , and the prevalence was 16.6% when using the most stringent criterion of cognitive impairment ( < 2 sd in three tests ; table 3 ) . 
 the most frequently affected domain was working memory with an impairment in 43.8% of the patients ( 28 patients ) , followed by verbal memory in 21.7% ( 13 patients ) , processing speed in 15.0% ( nine patients ) , verbal fluency in 13.3% ( eight patients ) , and finally , visuospatial memory in 11.7% ( seven patients ) . 
 when clinical variables were analyzed , disease duration had a moderate correlation with visuospatial memory and processing speed ( r=0.400 and r=0.370 , p<0.008 ) . 
 the expanded disability status scale ( edss ) score showed correlations with verbal memory , processing speed , and global cognitive index ( r=0.344 to 0.395 , p<0.008 ; table 4 ) . 
 symptoms of anxiety were present in 18.3% of patients , and depression symptoms were present in 33.3% of patients . 
 msnq score and anxiety symptoms were not associated with performance in any of the cognitive domains . verbal memory correlated with symptoms of depression ( r=0.415 , p=0.001 ) and fatigue ( r=0.383 , p=0.003 ) . 
 msnq correlated with depression ( r=0.405 , p=0.001 ) and anxiety ( r=0.255 , p=0.049 ) . 
 the aim of this study was to describe the extent and pattern of cognitive impairment in all the population affected by ms on a small island located in the southwest of europe . 
 lanzarote is an interesting place for ms study because its geographical location confers a high exposure to uv radiation for most of the year and patients probably have an optimal vitamin d serum level . 
 low vitamin d status is a possible environmental risk factor for ms development and outcome.37,38 severe cognitive impairment , with clear criteria for dementia ( dsm - iv - tr ) , was found in four patients in the study sample ( 6.3% of the total ) . 
 all these four patients had an obvious neuropsychological deficit , and they were unable to perform all the selected tests . 
 interviews with family members revealed significant functional impairment with an impact on activities of daily living . 
 the mean age of the dementia patients was 71 years ( 6078 years ) , and they obtained an edss score between 6.0 and 8.0 as well as had progressive forms of the disease . 
 the remaining nondementia patients formed a population with a low  moderate degree of disability ( < 3.0 on the edss ) , and most patients had an rrms . 
 the patient group underperformed the ( demographically equivalent ) cg in most of the battery tests after controlling the results for age and schooling , suggesting an overall performance deficit . 
 the range of variability observed in the prevalence of cognitive impairment is possibly associated with the methodological differences between the studies such as the study design and setting , as well as the neuropsychological tests selected for the study . 
 however , the biggest difference could be due to the consideration of the concept of cognitive impairment . 
 for example , a performance < 1.0 sd in one subtest may reflect the fluctuant nature of the disease and does not necessarily reflect the real pattern of cognitive impairment . 
 the concept of cognitive impairment proposed by amato et al12 as a failure in two or more brb - n subtests with scores at least 1.5 sd below the scores of hc is suggested for use here . using 
 similar figures were found by nogales - gaete et al39 with a sample of chilean patients with rrms , but the finding here differs from other studies conducted in oslo ( norway ) and the uk and from another study in spanish speaking patients in argentina,40 where the prevalence of cognitive impairment was > 45% . 
 the pattern of involvement found suggests that working memory and verbal memory are the most affected areas . 
 physical disability has been associated with cognitive impairment in some studies,6,14 while others found no such association.41 in the present work , a negative correlation between edss score and verbal memory , processing speed , and a global cognitive index was found . 
 these data could indicate that deficit in processing speed might be a good predictor of disease progression and , therefore , constitutes a key deficit in time monitoring . 
 however , the involvement of other domains such as working memory or verbal fluency could start in any stage of the disease and does not evolve in parallel with other symptoms of this disease . 
 msnq - self report ( as opposed to msnq - informant report ) is not considered a sensitive screen for neuropsycho - logical impairment in ms , and indeed , no correlation with this test was found here , suggesting that it is not an effective screening method for detecting cognitive impairment . 
 depressive symptoms were less ( present in 33.3% of the sample ) than those found in the literature,42 and higher scores on the depression scale were correlated with poorer performance in verbal memory . 
 this finding has been associated with the mineralocorticoid expression in the brain that diminishes during depression , especially in the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex , which are critical brain areas for memory.43 anxiety ( present in 18.3% of patients ) was not associated with cognitive performance . 
 this confirms findings of another study that has linked cognitive functioning with the state of fatigue in patients with ms44 and more specifically with memory.45 as a limitation of the study , the use of a more extensive evaluation protocol could provide more information about the true neuropsychological profile of studied patients . 
 at least 35% of the study population had mild - to - moderate cognitive impairment relative to a control sample . 
 the results of this study confirm the high prevalence of cognitive impairment in an ms cohort . 
 the most affected domains were working memory and verbal memory . working memory , verbal memory , and verbal fluency 
 did not deteriorate as the disease progressed , and therefore could not be used as a means of monitoring it . 
 cognitive decline was frequently related to clinical variables ( disease duration and edss score ) . 
 verbal memory was associated with depression and fatigue , but none of the cognitive domains showed a strong correlation with anxiety and subjective perception of cognitive impairment .","cognitively compromised patients also likely problems socialization cognitively intact ms patients cognitive impairment associated nonsomatic symptoms depression rrms finding supports importance evaluating depressive symptoms cognitive impairment suspected patients rrms anxiety less studied depression ms patients although evidence high levels anxiety associated poor performance cognitive tasks especially processing speed working memory visual spatial memory study conducted lanzarote easternmost landmass canary islands spain figure

"transurethral resection of bladder tumor ( turbt ) is well - established modality for treating non - muscle - invasive bladder cancer . 
 furthermore , it is essential for evaluating the pathological depth of bladder tumors in resected specimens . despite improvements in endoscopic instruments and imaging systems , 
 there are well - recognized complications associated with turbt , such as bladder perforation , irrigation fluid absorption , bleeding , infection , damage to the ureteric orifices , obturator nerve stimulation , and tumor cell implantation . among these 
 , bladder perforation is one of the most frequent complications of turbt and is sometimes associated with obturator reflex . 
 several researchers have reported that the risk of obturator nerve stimulation is from 10.6% to 11% . 
 several advances in instruments and techniques , including modifications of resectoscope design and snare resection , have been proposed to remove pedunculated bladder tumors . 
 however , difficulties remain in safely collecting adequate specimens for flat tumors . we introduce an easy technique for superficial bladder cancer that uses a standard monopolar resectoscope loop . in this study 
 , we demonstrate the easy resection technique for superficial bladder tumors that we have termed the "" grasp and bite "" turbt technique and compare it with conventional turbt .

 statistical analyses were performed with ibm spss statistics ver . 20.0 ( ibm co. , armonk , ny , usa ) . 
 from january to april 2012 , 16 patients were enrolled who had undergone conventional turbt . from january to april 2013 , the grasp and bite technique was applied to 19 patients with superficial bladder tumors . 
 the two groups had comparable demographic and intraoperative data , including patient age , tumor size , patient gender , multiplicity , tumor morphology , and tumor location ( table 1 ) . 
 the mean operative time was similar in the conventional and grasp and bite groups ( 35 minutes vs. 35 minutes , respectively ) . 
 the mean duration of irrigation , duration of catheterization , and hospital stay were not significantly different between the groups . 
 there were no cases of bladder perforation , excessive obturator reflex , or persistent hematuria in either group . 
 2 ) . there was no significant difference in recurrence rates between the conventional and grasp and bite turbt groups during the 14-month follow - up ( 43.8% vs. 31.6% , p=0.458 ) . 
 the purpose of turbt is complete removal of all visible tumors for curative intent and acquisition of adequate tissue for pathologic evaluation . 
 also , tumor recurrence after turbt is relatively high . for non - muscle - invasive bladder cancer , the probability of recurrence after 1 year ranges from 15% to 70% . 
 many obstacles can arise during the procedure , such as bladder perforation , bleeding , obturator reflex , and damage to the ureteral orifices . to overcome these difficulties , many surgical techniques and innovative devices 
 for example , endoscopic snare resection of a bladder tumor can be used to remove pedunculated tumors . 
 although the snare method offers the advantage of en block resection , smaller and sessile tumors are not suitable for this technique . 
 new devices such as water jet hydrodissection and the thulium : yttrium aluminium garnet laser may be applicable for en block resection of superficial tumors . however , further studies and development of these techniques are necessary to determine efficacy and oncologic outcomes . variable methods of tumor resection have been developed and used in association with tumor size and location . 
 the side - to - side bidirectional lateral rotating handgrip and loop allows excellent precision and control over the loop under direct vision . 
 loop modification , the so - called "" runner , "" can push the bladder wall away during resection , thereby widening the view and decreasing the risk of perforation . 
 we wanted a technique in which we could use a conventional resectoscope and loop without accessory equipment . 
 when using a wire - loop resectoscope , the tumor must be resected thoroughly to obtain adequate muscle tissue . 
 the movement of the loop is somewhat fast and deep to avoid charring of the surrounding mucosa and bladder perforation . 
 direct pressure to the bladder wall may allow deeper tissue to protrude into the bladder wall and then be easily removed by use of the resectoscope . instead of the curvilinear movement of the resectoscope end 
 according to the curved bladder surface , the easy linear motion can make a curved resection with grasping . using our "" grasp and bite "" technique 
 , beginners can easily perform turbt safely . often , small and sessile tumors are missed and severely damaged during resection and cauterization . the grasp and bite technique 
 , the protruding tumor can be removed f irst by the conventional method , and then the stalk and base lesion can be removed by the grasp and bite technique . 
 , the grasp and bite technique could have difficulties in a posterior or posterolateral located tumor because of its moving mechanism . in our series , two posterior and four posterolateral tumors were successfully accessed by use of suprapubic pressure and nearly emptying the bladder . 
 similar to conventional turbt , it was also difficult to access posterior tumors with the grasp and bite method . in our consecutive cases , 
 general anesthesia was preferred in the conventional and grasp and bite groups ( 81.3% vs 57.3% , p=0.138 ) . 
 also , tumor locations did not differ significantly between the two groups ( p=0.253 ) . 
 we postulated that the grasping method , which lifts the tissue away from the obturator nerve and tightly holds the grasped tissue , may eventually weaken the reflex . considering this small population , however , 
 thus , there could have been a selection bias . also , the study population was small , and thus we were unable to perform statistical analysis of the oncologic outcome as recurrence - free survival . 
 this was a preliminary study to develop a surgical technique performed by an experienced surgeon . 
 larger prospective studies with a long follow - up period will be necessary to show the oncologic advantage of this technique . to determine the feasibility of the technique for inexperienced surgeons , 
 future study will address a teaching protocol comparing the conventional and grasp and bite methods . 
 investigation of tissue adequacy of proper muscle and effect of coagulation will be our next subject of study . 
 our study demonstrated that grasp and bite turbt is a safe and effective method for removing superficial bladder tumors . 
 this technique has merit for flat tumors and can also be used for pedunculated and poorly accessible tumors . 
 the grasp and bite method may be a shortcut for overcoming the difficulties of turbt .

"obesity has become a major global health challenge . although epidemiological data show that regular physical activity helps prevent obesity , cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and hypertension , the majority of adults fail to maintain physical activity at levels that can promote health . 
 lack of time  is the most commonly cited barrier to regular exercise participation , a more time - efficient mode of exercise training has been developed . both high - intensity interval training ( hiit ; 
 involves  near maximal  effort at intensities between 80 and 100% of maximal heart rate ) [ 3 , 4 ] and low - volume sprint interval training ( sit ; involves  all - out  or  supramaximal  effort at the intensity of 100% of maximal oxygen uptake ) [ 3 , 4 ] are time - efficient training strategies that can rapidly improve cardiorespiratory fitness [ 5 , 6 ] , muscle metabolic adaptations [ 7 , 8 ] , and insulin sensitivity   to resemble the changes elicited by moderate - intensity continuous training ( mict ) . 
 excessive accumulation of body fat , especially intra - abdominal visceral fat , is identified as a potent independent predictor for hyperlipidemia , insulin resistance , and metabolic syndrome , whereas a slight change in the visceral adipose area / volume may significantly alter the risk profile . 
 a growing body of evidence has demonstrated that hiit / sit could reduce body mass [ 5 , 10 ] , total or regional fat mass [ 6 , 1012 ] , and waist circumference [ 10 , 11 , 13 ] and increase fat - free mass [ 5 , 6 , 1012 ] . however , in terms of short - term intervention ( e.g. , 18 sessions for six weeks ) , it seems that sit running is effective at improving body composition in active individuals [ 6 , 11 ] , whereas hiit interventions showed inconsistent findings in terms of body composition , including improvement   or ineffectiveness [ 14 , 15 ] . from the view of the influential factors of body composition , confounding factors such as extra physical activity in addition to the training program [ 5 , 10 , 11 ] and/or the dietary intake of the participants [ 6 , 8 , 13 , 16 ] 
 given the conflicting results in previous studies [ 5 , 17 ] , whether the hiit intervention induces significant improvements in fat mass , lean mass , and regional fat deposits in comparison with an exercise control remains to be elucidated . 
 although some studies have reported that hiit protocols are enjoyable and adherent for both active male subjects   and inactive normal - weight subjects , some researchers have contended that , for the largely inactive and/or obese population , the strenuous nature of sit may produce negative emotions toward exercise adherence and is likely to be a deterrent to participation [ 18 , 20 ] . 
 given the fact that the power output of the wingate - based protocol with hard resistance ( typically 7.5% of body mass ) rises quickly and then decreases precipitously over the 30  s , this kind of sit training may not be suitable for the inactive female cohort . as a result 
 little et al .   designed a low - demanding hiit model consisting of 10  60  s work bouts at 100% maximal heart rate ( hr ) interspersed with 60  s of recovery . 
 trapp et al .   established a brief hiit protocol of 8  s sprint cycling interspersed with 12  s of rest for 20  min and found that 15 weeks of hiit intervention with this protocol could improve cardiovascular fitness , body composition , and insulin resistance in young women when compared to 40  min of mict with a similar energy expenditure . 
 given that the young women with a higher bmi had a greater fat loss in trapp et al . 
 's study , we speculated that overweight / obese women and lean women may have different physiological responses to the same hiit training protocol . 
 hormonal abnormalities play a pathogenetic role in the development of excess body fat and are associated with metabolic diseases . 
 a number of hormones , for example , leptin , growth hormone ( gh ) , testosterone , cortisol , and fibroblast growth factor 21 ( fgf-21 ) , regulate lipid metabolism   and affect muscle protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy . 
 it has been reported that acute high - intensity interval exercise may result in optimal responses on circulating testosterone , growth hormone , and cortisol   in well - trained males as well as in type 1 diabetic individuals . 
 however , it is not clear whether the hormonal responses to an acute bout of high - intensity interval exercise can be sustained after a period of training . collectively , the purpose of this study was mainly to compare the effects of five weeks of hiit intervention or mict on body composition and blood glucose as well as the systemic hormones that may influence body composition and blood glucose in overweight and obese young women . 
 we hypothesized that both training programs would result in similar influences on the improvements of body composition ( e.g. , reduce fat mass and increase lean mass ) and blood glucose , while the improvements are associated with the upregulated gh and testosterone and the downregulated cortisol , leptin , and fgf-21 . 
 furthermore , hiit would be more time - efficient and perceived as being easier when compared with mict . 
 the inclusion criteria were being between 18 and 30 years of age , having a classification of inactivity ( defined as completion of less than 90  min of moderate - intensity exercise per week over the past six months ) , and being overweight or obese , defined as having a body mass index ( bmi , in kgm ) over 23 and a body fat percentage ( % ) over 30 . 
 volunteers who were interested in the study and met the inclusion criteria were required to complete a par - q form and a medical history questionnaire for further eligibility screening . 
 smokers , alcoholics , diabetics , persons with endocrine disorders , and users of oral contraceptive pills or any prescribed medications known to affect body composition or the endocrine system were excluded . 
 then , the subjects underwent a full physical examination to obtain clearance for undertaking vigorous exercise from a doctor . under the assumptions of a within - subject correlation of 0.70 between the pre- and postintervention measures and a power of 0.80 with an effect size of 0.48 based on the primary outcome of vo2peak resulting from high - intensity interval training [ 3 , 29 ] , the sample size for the hiit group 
 after the screening phase , 22 eligible subjects were recruited to participate in this study . 
 they all provided written informed consent before being randomly assigned to either the hiit group ( n = 11 ) or the mict group ( n = 11 ) . 
 one participant in the hiit group and three participants in the mict group quit before completing the training intervention for personal reasons ( figure 1 ) . 
 each subject completed a five - week hiit or mict exercise intervention ( four sessions per week ) . before and after the training intervention 
 , subjects underwent a body composition analysis and a vo2peak assessment , and their fasting blood samples were obtained . 
 all pretraining and posttraining measures were conducted in the follicular stage based on the self - reported menstrual cycle survey . because of the different menstrual cycles for the subjects , the starting time for baseline measures and training intervention were different among subjects , with the last subject starting two weeks later than the first one . 
 however , all of the pretraining measures were taken within 48 to 144  h before the training intervention and all of the posttraining measures were taken within 48 to 144  h after the last training session . before baseline measures , each subject visited the laboratory to sign the consent form , become familiar with all testing and training procedures , and provide a three - day diet record . 
 baseline measures were conducted on three different days , separated by at least 24  h , and all measures were completed at least 48  h before the training intervention . 
 subjects were asked to refrain from strenuous activity and caffeine for 48  h and fasted overnight ( 12  h ) prior to the baseline blood sampling . 
 8  ml blood samples were collected from the cubital veins using serum separation tubes and were left to clot at room temperature for 60  min . 
 then , the blood samples were centrifuged at 3000  rpm for 10  min at 4c , separated for serum , and subsequently frozen at 80c until later analysis . 
 subjects were instructed to come to the laboratory in the morning after a fasting state ( 12  h ) . 
 height and weight were determined using standard methods with a stadiometer and an electronic scale ( in light clothing and with no footwear ) to the nearest 0.1  cm and 0.1  kg , respectively . 
 body mass index was calculated by dividing weight ( kg ) by height ( m ) squared . by the same operator 
 , subjects were scanned in a supine position using a dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry scanner ( norland xr-36 dxa densitometer , norland corporation , fort atkinson , ws , usa ) and were analyzed with a software program ( 3.7.4/2.1.0 ; norland corporation ) . the instrument was calibrated daily using the phantoms provided by the manufacturer , and the value of the intra - assay coefficient of variation ( cv ) was 0.53% . 
 the abdominal region referred to the area consisting of the line between the two iliac crests , the two edges of the hip , and the lateral sides of the femoral necks . 
 the trunk region was defined as being from the lower edge of the mandibular to the upper edge of the line between the iliac crests , excluding the head and upper limbs . 
 lean mass and fat mass were calculated from the total and regional analysis of the whole body scan . 
 the subjects performed a graded maximal exercise test on a computer - controlled cycle ergometer ( monark 839e , sweden ) to determine vo2peak and peak power output ( ppo ) . 
 after a two - minute warm - up at 30  w , the subjects pedaled at the initial workload of 50  w and maintained a cycling speed of 60  5  rpm , and the workload was increased by 25  w every three min until volitional exhaustion . 
 respiratory gases were assessed continuously using an automatic gas analyzer ( meta - max 3b , cortex biophysik gmbh , leipzig , germany ) , and the highest oxygen consumption averaged over the final 15  s was identified as the vo2peak . 
 ppo was calculated according to the following formula : ppo = wcom + ( t/180 )  25 , where wcom is the last completed workload , t is the time completed in the final unfinished workload ( in seconds ) , 180 is the increment duration ( s ) in each workload , and 25 is the workload increment . 
 both the hiit and the mict exercise training were conducted four days per week for five weeks . 
 participants in the hiit group performed 60 repetitions of high - intensity interval exercise ( 8  s cycling and 12  s passive recovery ) on a cycle ergometer ( monark 874e , sweden ) for 20  min . 
 a prerecorded tape was used to coordinate the hiit intervention , and all subjects worked as hard as they could during the exercise phase . 
 the initial resistance of the exercise phase was 1.0  kg , and once an individual could complete two consecutive sessions at the given workload , resistance would be gradually increased by increments of 0.5  kg until reaching 0.05  body weight . 
 hr ( polar f4 m blk , finland ) and ratings of perceived exertion ( rpe , borg scale ) were recorded before and immediately after the completion of the 8  s cycling exercise for every five intervals . during the first and last training sessions 
 the product of all intervention sessions and the mean value of energy expenditure measured during the two mentioned sessions were regarded as the total energy expenditure of hiit . 
 participants in the mict group performed a continuous cycling exercise at 65% of pre - vo2peak on an ergocycle ( ergometer 900pc , ergoline , germany ) for 40  min ; a cycling speed of 60  5  rpm would be maintained throughout each training session . with the increasing fitness indicated by a decreased hr , 
 the energy expenditure for every training session was estimated from an individual 's vo2 : energy expenditure = 5.05 ( kcall ) 
 vo2 ( lmin )  exercise time ( min ) , whereas vo2 was determined using an equation for leg cycling ergometry : vo2 = 7.0 + 1.8  workload ( kgmmin)/body weight ( kg ) . 
 the total energy expenditure of the mict group was calculated as the product of all intervention sessions and the energy expenditure of each session . 
 serum glucose was measured via the glucose oxidase method using a roche / hitachi p800 modular chemistry analyzer ( roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim , germany ) . 
 serum concentrations of testosterone , cortisol , and gh were analyzed using commercially available electrochemiluminescence immunoassay kits ( roche diagnostics gmbh , mannheim , germany ) , whereas leptin and fgf-21 were measured using a commercial enzyme - linked immunosorbent assays ( elisa ) kit ( abcam , cambridge , uk ) . 
 the cvs were 1.1% for glucose , 4.5% for testosterone , 4.6% for cortisol , 2.9% for gh , 2.4% for leptin , and 2.6% for fgf-21 . 
 subjects in both the hiit and mict groups were instructed to maintain their normal eating habits and normal daily physical activities during the study period . 
 each subject provided a three - day diet inventory one week before and one week after the intervention as well as during the third week of the intervention . 
 energy intake and diet component analyses were conducted by the sports nutrition research center ( national institute of sports medicine , china ) using the nutrition analysis and management system . 
 daily physical activities were monitored using pedometers ( yamax sw-200 digiwalker , japan ) for three days per week for a total of seven weeks ( on the weeks before and after training and every week during exercise training ) . 
 posttraining assessments were performed in the same way as described in the pretraining testing protocol and were completed within 48 to 144  h following the last training session . 
 blood samples were taken within 96 to 144  h after the intervention , whereas body composition and vo2peak were determined within 48 to 72  h after the last training session . 
 data were analyzed using pasw software ( release 22.0 ; ibm , ny , usa ) . 
 independent - sample t - tests were performed to determine the differences in training data ( hr and rpe ) and energy expenditure between the two groups . 
 a two - way mixed analysis of variance ( anova ) with repeated measures was used to test for main ( time ) and interaction effects ( time  group ) . 
 significant interactions or main effects were determined using tukey 's honestly significant difference post hoc test . as for effect 
 size measure of the main effect and the interaction effect , partial  was considered small if  < 0.06 and large if  > 0.14 . 
 all results were presented as mean  standard deviation ( sd ) , and p values of < 0.05 were considered significant . 
 there were no significant differences on any measured variables between the two groups on pretraining tests . 
 there was no significant difference in training hr between hiit and mict ( 164  8  bpm in the hiit group versus 160  12  bpm in the mict group ; p = 0.435 ) . however , mict is perceived to be significantly harder compared to hiit ( 13  1 in hiit group versus 15  1 in mict group ; p = 0.042 ) . in the first training session , 
 the values of energy expenditure were 174  28  kcal in hiit and 301  45  kcal in mict , and the former spent less than the latter ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 similarly , the total energy expenditure of the intervention in the hiit group ( 3167  549  kcal ) was significantly lower than that in the mict group ( 6011  505  kcal ; p < 0.001 ) . 
 the daily calorie intakes ( table 3 ) were not different within group and between groups over time ( as evaluated before training , during training , and after training ; p > 0.05 ) . the proportions of macronutrient intake were approximately 50% , 35% , and 15% for carbohydrates , fat , and protein , respectively , in both groups , with no within - group or interaction differences ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 physical activities recorded by the pedometers had no within - group or interaction differences before ( 7673  1145 steps in hiit versus 8062  1367 steps in mict ) , during ( 9785  1640 steps in hiit versus 8517  791 steps in mict ) , and after intervention ( 7434  1225 steps in hiit versus 7023  849 steps in mict ) ( p > 0.05 ) . 
 after five weeks of exercise training , both hiit and mict resulted in a significant improvement in vo2peak ( p = 0.006 ;  = 0.38 ) and ppo ( p < 0.001 ;  = 0.61 ) . 
 hiit training increased vo2peak and ppo by 7.9% and 13.8% , respectively , whereas mict training increased vo2peak and ppo by 11.7% and 21.9% , respectively . 
 there were no group differences in the magnitude of improvement in vo2peak and ppo ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 1 ) . 
 after the intervention , despite no significant changes in weight , bmi , total fat mass ( tfm ) , and total body fatness ( tbf ) for both groups , the mict group experienced significantly decreased total lean mass ( tlm ) ( 1.7  kg or 3.9% ; p = 0.011 ) and leg lm ( 0.6  kg or 3.3% , p = 0.018 ) . 
 meanwhile , tlm and leg lm in the hiit group were unchanged ( reduced by 0.2% and 0.1% , resp . ; p > 0.05 ) . in the regions of the trunk and abdomen , 
 no significant changes in lean mass , fat mass , and fatness were observed within group or between groups ( table 1 ) . 
 fasting glucose tended to be significantly decreased ( p = 0.062 ;  = 0.213 ) after the training intervention , but no group difference was found . 
 there were no within - group or group differences in serum levels of testosterone , cortisol , the ratio of testosterone and cortisol ( t / c ratio ) , gh , leptin , or fgf-21 ( table 2 ) . 
 for all subjects , no significant correlations were found among the variables of the changes in aerobic capacity , body composition , and the changes in blood parameters . 
 this study showed that five weeks of hiit , despite involving half of the time and exercise energy expenditure when compared to mict , resulted in a similar improvement in aerobic capacity but had no influence on fat mass or lean mass in the trunk or abdomen . 
 hiit subjects seemly lost less lean body mass and lean leg mass than did mict subjects after training . 
 moreover , both short - term training protocols resulted in a trend to decrease fasting serum glucose but had no effects on systemic hormones , including leptin , testosterone , cortisol , gh , and fgf-21 , in overweight and obese young women . 
 different forms of hiit have been shown to significantly increase vo2peak [ 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 33 ] and aerobic capacity [ 10 , 11 ] . 
 the present study found that , after five weeks of this low - volume hiit protocol , the relative vo2peak and ppo were increased by 7.9% and 13.8% , respectively , consistent with an average of 7.3  4.8% increment in vo2peak reported in a meta - analysis after the wingate - based sprint interval intervention in sedentary female cohorts . in accordance with previous studies [ 5 , 17 ] , 
 our study also did not find any additional effect caused by the hiit protocol when compared to mict . 
 moreover , previous studies have demonstrated that , using the same hiit protocol , vo2peak was improved by 15.0% ( + 5.2  mlminkg ) in obese men for 12 weeks   and was increased by 23.8% ( + 7.6  mlminkg ) in sedentary women for 15 weeks , respectively . 
 although the 7.9% ( + 2.5  mlminkg ) magnitude of vo2peak was relatively smaller , which might be caused by the shorter duration and differences in exercise intensity , this present study indicates that short - term training with this brief hiit protocol could also result in rapid adaptation in cardiovascular function in inactive obese young women . 
 the possible reasons might be attributed to the upregulated mitochondrial oxidative enzyme activity [ 7 , 8 , 21 , 34 ] , the enhanced fractional muscle oxygen extraction [ 6 , 35 ] , and/or the increased stroke volume . 
 since the hr monitored during exercises were analogous ( 164  8  bpm in hiit versus 160  12  bpm in mict ) between the two groups , the significantly lower rpe reported in the hiit group may be mainly caused by the interval exercise mode with submaximal exercise intensity , which was 89% of vo2peak during the exercise phases and 76% of vo2peak during the recovery phases according to the data measured in the first hiit session . 
 the game - like nature of hiit , varying between short sprints and recovery intervals , may be helpful in reducing the perception of effort . 
 collectively , compared to mict , the present hiit protocol is a more time - efficient and easier exercise mode for improving cardiorespiratory fitness in the overweight female cohort . to our surprise , 
 the mict group lost 1.7  kg of total lean mass and 0.6  kg of leg lean mass after training . 
 dxa , as a frequently used method to assess body composition , had the smallest detectable differences , at 1.39  kg and 1.30  kg for fat and lean mass in obese children , and the cvs for fat and lean mass were 1.2% and 1.1% in obese females . based on this evidence 
 , we estimate that an approximate 1  kg reduction in total and leg lean mass in the mict group is probably a consequence of measurement error from the dxa . 
 moreover , we did not detect any significant reductions in total and regional fat mass as well as fasting leptin levels following the five - week hiit training intervention . 
 trapp et al .   showed that 15 weeks of hiit training with a similar protocol significantly reduced resting leptin levels , and the decreases in leptin levels were positively correlated with the decreases in body weight among normal - weight females . on the contrary 
 , a recent study demonstrated that there were no changes in fasting serum leptin despite improvement in body composition after ten weeks of high - intensity interval training in young women with polycystic ovary syndrome . 
 however , due to the body composition , as assessed using a bioelectrical impedance analysis in their study , we believed the notion that short - term exercise training ( 12 weeks ) does not affect leptin levels   and that long - term exercise training that has reduced leptin levels is generally not independent of changes in body fat mass . 
 furthermore , given that fat losses were reported with the same 8  s/12  s protocol but using longer interventions ( i.e. , 15 weeks and 12 weeks ) [ 5 , 10 ] , we speculated that , for a less intense hiit protocol , a longer duration is essential for accumulating measurable alterations in fat loss . there is no definite conclusion regarding whether hiit intervention improves body composition in overweight and obese individuals . 
 several recent studies have shown that hiit interval training reduces total fat mass [ 5 , 10 , 12 ] and abdominal and visceral fat mass [ 10 , 12 ] and improves lean mass [ 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 ] effectively in both obese and nonobese adults , whereas some evidence reported no changes in body composition in overweight individuals [ 16 , 17 ] or in active men . 
 however , sit , a form of supermaximal exercise intensity of a shorter duration [ 3 , 4 ] , seems to be more effective compared to hiit for improving body composition . 
 a short wingate - based sit , which lasted for two weeks , has been shown to reduce abdominal and subcutaneous fat mass in sedentary overweight / obese men , reflected by decreases in waist ( 1.4  cm or 1.1% ) and hip ( 1.1  cm or 1.0% ) circumferences . 
 consistently , six weeks of running sit interventions led to significant decrement of fat mass and increment of lean mass in recreationally active men   and women , and the improvements in body composition were comparable to that of mict . 
 the similar fat losses between hiit and mict may result from the increased excess postexercise oxygen consumption ( epoc ) [ 43 , 44 ] and/or the improved muscle oxidative capacity [ 7 , 8 , 21 ] , though hiit had a lower total training volume . 
 additionally , in the present study , the training intervention demonstrated a trend toward improved fasting glucose concentrations in the obese female cohort with normal fasting glucose level . 
 previous studies showed that short - term hiit , and even acute hiit , can rapidly improve glucose control in prediabetic [ 45 , 46 ] and type 2 diabetic patients . on the contrary , some studies reported that , when compared to baseline , short - term wingate - based hiit improved insulin sensitivity but had no substantial advantage for improving fasting blood glucose in healthy sedentary   and overweight and obese men . nybo et al 
 .   found that 12 weeks of 20-minute high - intensity interval running per week had a similar effect of improving fasting glucose as 60-minute continuous running at 65%  vo2peak in sedentary overweight and obese males . 
 taken together , the discrepancy in fasting blood glucose resulting from hiit may be attributable to differences in protocols , intervention durations , and initial fasting glucose levels . 
 we did not find any changes in the basal levels of fgf-21 after the hiit or mict interventions in this population . 
 accumulated evidence derived primarily from animal models indicates that this novel myokine has therapeutic potential for the treatment of type 2 diabetes   and has beneficial effects on metabolic disorders . 
 animal studies have demonstrated that both acute exercise   and chronic exercise training   could increase serum fgf-21 levels in rodents , and the increment is accompanied by increasing serum levels of ketone bodies , glycerol , and free fatty acids . among the few studies examining the effects of exercise / training on fgf-21 levels in humans , it has been shown that a single bout of treadmill running exercise   as well as two weeks of daily supervised training   increased serum fgf-21 levels in healthy men and women . in the present study , neither exercise regimen had an effect on fasting levels of serum testosterone , cortisol , t / c ratio , and gh , indicating that short - term exercise training , even at a high intensity , can not induce significant effects on the resting hormones in inactive overweight and obese young women . 
 although an acute bout of high - intensity interval exercise or sprint exercise would result in marked increment in cortisol and gh levels , previous studies have shown that the resting levels of cortisol , testosterone , and gh are unlikely to be influenced by exercise training [ 24 , 51 ] . 
 similar to our study , the fasting levels of gh were unaffected by four to six weeks of hiit / sit in sedentary men   or recreationally active males . 
 given that the hormonal changes respond mainly to acute exercise [ 24 , 51 ] , future studies should examine the acute responses of different hormones , as well as body composition , before and after hiit intervention in overweight and obese individuals . 
 first , on the basis of sample estimation from the potential changes of vo2peak , we acknowledged that the small sample size in the present study limits the ability to draw a meaningful conclusion regarding the efficacy of hiit in improving body composition against traditional continuous exercise . 
 second , this study was conducted during a time of the year that people are more likely to gain weight , which started from mid - october and ended in early december . 
 the seasonal factors may also have an influence on body composition since an average net weight gain of up to 0.5  kg in the fall and winter has been reported in a previous study . because of this , for future studies aimed at reducing weight , seasonal factors should be taken into consideration , and a nonexercise control group is needed for interpretation of the relative results . 
 finally , considering the great effect of the combination of a hypoenergetic diet and exercise on weight loss and preserving muscle mass , future studies may consider managing the factors involving demographic characteristics ( gender , age , menstrual cycle , etc . ) , hiit modality ( low and high demanding ) , daily physical activity ( intensity and amount ) , and nutrition status ( high- and low - protein diet ) thoroughly . 
 this would be helpful to ascertain the impact of high - intensity interval training on metabolic outcomes and the potential roles of hormone meditation during changes in overweight and obese populations . in conclusion 
 , the present study shows that when compared to mict , short - term brief hiit intervention with 8  s of high - intensity interval cycling interspersed with 12  s of rest is a more time - efficient approach and is perceived as being easier for improving aerobic fitness and blood glucose in sedentary overweight and obese young women .

 methods . 
 eighteen subjects completed 20 sessions of hiit or mict for five weeks . 
 hiit involved 60  8  s cycling at ~90% of peak oxygen consumption ( vo2peak ) interspersed with 12  s recovery , whereas mict involved 40-minute continuous cycling at 65% of vo2peak . 
 vo2peak , body composition , blood glucose , and fasting serum hormones , including leptin , growth hormone , testosterone , cortisol , and fibroblast growth factor 21 , were measured before and after training . 
 results . 
 both exercise groups achieved significant improvements in vo2peak ( + 7.9% in hiit versus + 11.7% in mict ) and peak power output ( + 13.8% in hiit versus + 21.9% in mict ) despite no training effects on body composition or the relevant systemic hormones . 
 blood glucose tended to be decreased after the intervention ( p = 0.062 ) . 
 the rating of perceived exertion in mict was higher than that in hiit ( p = 0.042 ) . 
 conclusion . compared with mict , 
 short - term hiit is more time - efficient and is perceived as being easier for improving cardiorespiratory fitness and fasting blood glucose for overweight and obese young women ."
"the history of total knee arthroplasty ( tka ) designs demonstrates attempts at implants that more closely match patient anatomy for improved treatment results . 
 traditional total knee implant systems were designed to provide components of a wide range of sizes to achieve a proper fit in almost all patients . however , 
 selection of a femoral component of correct size for a particular patient can still be challenging not only because it is common to have a distal femoral anteroposterior ( ap ) dimension going in the middle of usual 3 - 4 mm gap between each sizes of traditional femoral components but also because medial lateral ( ml ) overhang is sometimes encountered even with a traditional femoral component with a precisely matching ap dimension . in sizing of a femoral component , 
 the ap dimension is important to maintain the flexion - extension gap and optimal tension in the extensor mechanism , whereas the ml dimension determines adequate coverage of the resected bone surface , allowing more even stress distribution and smooth tracking of the patellofemoral joint . 
 although there is no evidence on the clinical effect of underhang and overhang of implants , theoretical assumption is possible . if a component is too small ( underhang ) , there will be higher contact stresses on the reduced bone - implant interface , increasing the risk of subsidence and loosening . 
 conversely , if a component is too large ( overhang ) , it may impinge on the surrounding capsular tissues and ligaments , causing pain and limiting the range of motion ( rom ) of the joint . 
 anatomic variations between male and female are well - documented in several anatomic and radiographic studies1,2,3,4,5 ) . in general , females tend to have smaller distal femora and different shapes with a narrower ml dimension for a given ap dimension when compared with males1 ) . 
 in addition , females are thought to have an increased quardriceps angle and a less prominent anterior femoral condyle than males even though controversy still remains6,7 ) . 
 the recent introduction of a gender - specific implant ( gender solutions nexgen high - flex ; zimmer inc . 
 , warsaw , in ) designed specifically for females started the debate that has focused on the effect of gender on the results of tka using traditional implant systems . 
 the gender solutions implant was designed to better accommodate the anatomic differences noted in females with a narrower ml dimension for any given ap dimension . besides , the angle of trochlear groove was increased and the anterior flange thickness and width were reduced to more closely reproduce the native female anatomy . with this background 
 , we designed this present study in order to find out if gender - specific implants reduce the incidence of overhang during operation and there is any clinical or radiological advantage of gender specific implants over traditional implants . 
 we hypothesized : 1 ) the incidence of femoral component overhang would be reduced with the use of gender - specific femoral components and 2 ) clinical and radiological results would show no difference between two types of implants in a short - term follow - up because no clinical disadvantage of overhang has been reported so far . 
 between may 2007 and january 2008 , 136 primary tkas were undertaken in a consecutive series of 92 patients . 
 there were 7 males ( 8 knees ) and 85 females ( 128 knees ) . the criteria for inclusion into the study consisted of female gender , a primary diagnosis of osteoarthritis and a minimum 3-year follow - up . 
 patients with severe bone loss requiring structural bone grafting or metal augmentation were excluded from the present study . 
 their mean age at the time of the operation was 67.9 years ( range , 52 to 80 years ) and their mean body mass index ( bmi ) was 26.8 kg / m ( range , 20.2 to 33.3 kg / m ) . 
 the mean follow - up duration was 41.3 months ( range , 36 to 50 months ) . there were 28 unilateral procedures and 38 bilateral procedures that were performed two weeks apart . 
 we compared the clinical and radiological outcomes of tka using a gender - specific implant ( gender solutions nexgen high - flex ) and a traditional implant ( nexgen legacy posterior stabilized flex [ lps - flex ] , zimmer inc . ) at 3 years after surgery . 
 we also analyzed intraoperative measurements , including the overhang of femoral component and patella tracking , after tka using two different trial components . 
 all the operations were performed by the senior author ( bin ) using the same technique . 
 after eversion of the patella , resection of the femoral condyles was performed to remove a thickness of bone equal to that of the femoral component to be inserted . 
 the femoral cutting block was placed in 3 to 5 of external rotation to the posterior condyles , and this was ascertained by the ap trochlear sulcus . 
 the valgus angle of femoral resection was made using an intramedullary guide , and ap cutting was performed using an anterior referencing system . 
 femoral component sizing was based on the ap dimension of the femur , which was measured with a femoral ap sizer during operation . 
 if a measurement of the ap dimension fell between two sizes , the smaller size femoral component was chosen . using an intramedullary tibial guide , 
 a 10 mm - thick tibial bone resection was performed to obtain a surface that was perpendicular to the shaft of the tibia in the coronal plane , with a 7 posterior slope in the sagittal plane . 
 two different trial femoral components ( gender solutions nexgen high - flex prosthesis and nexgen lps - flex prosthesis ) of the same size were inserted sequentially after femoral and tibial bone cuts . at this moment , 
 overhang of each trial femoral component was examined medially and laterally at three cut surfaces ( anterior , anterior chamfer and distal cut surfaces ) . 
 patellar tracking was also checked with each trial component using the ' no thumb ' test . 
 the rom in which the patella showed congruent tracking was recorded with each trial femoral component and designated as congruent patella tracking rom . 
 based on the coverage of cut surface and patellar tracking , appropriate type of permanent femoral implant was chosen by the surgeon . 
 the patients who received a gender - specific implant ( gender solutions ) were assigned to group i and those with a traditional implant ( nexgen lps - flex ) were to group ii . 
 two days after surgery , drain was removed and continuous passive motion and tolerable weight bearing were started . 
 the entire data were collected prospectively from the beginning of the present study and were compared and analyzed retrospectively . 
 this study was approved by the institutional review board at our hospital and informed consent was waived . 
 presence of overhang at the three femoral cut surfaces and the congruent patella tracking rom of each prosthesis were assessed intraoperatively and compared between groups . 
 postoperatively , the patients were reviewed at six weeks , three months , six months , and annually after surgery . 
 clinical parameters including hospital for special surgery ( hss ) knee score8 ) , flexion contracture , maximal flexion , and complications were evaluated and compared preoperatively and at 3 years after surgery . 
 flexion contracture and maximal flexion were measured using a manual goniometer with the arms aligned along the long axes of the femur and tibia on the lateral side of the knee joint . 
 patients were told to straighten and bend their knee until they felt a slight degree of pain in supine position . 
 all the data at follow - up examinations were recorded by an orthopedic surgeon and compiled by a research assistant who was not a part of the surgical team and had no information about the surgical and radiological findings . 
 radiographic evaluation included standing ap , lateral , and merchant views of both knees at three months , six months , and annually after surgery , which were analyzed using the radiological evaluation system of the knee society9 ) to delineate radiolucency around the components . 
 postoperative patellar tracking was assessed by measuring patella tilt angle and patella displacement as described by gomes et al.10 ) . 
 all the radiographs were analyzed by two of the co - authors ( kim jm and kim sb ) who were blinded to patient information .

 postoperative patellar tracking was assessed by measuring patella tilt angle and patella displacement as described by gomes et al.10 ) . 
 all the radiographs were analyzed by two of the co - authors ( kim jm and kim sb ) who were blinded to patient information . 
 the incidence of overhang of the trial femoral component was significantly higher in the knees with the traditional component than those with the gender - specific trial component ( table 1 ) . 
 of the 104 knees , overhang was observed at least in one area in 62 knees with the traditional trial component ( 59.6% ) compared to 26 knees ( 25.0% ) with the gender - specific trial component ( p<0.001 ) . among the six areas where overhang was examined , 
 the lateral anterior cut surface was the area where overhang of the femoral component was most frequent regardless of the type of the trial component . 
 distal medial area was the only exception that did not show statistically significant difference ( p=0.250 ) . 
 sixty - two knees ( 59.6% ) that demonstrated overhang with traditional trial components were replaced with a gender - specific implant ( group i ) and the remaining 42 knees ( 40.4% ) that showed no overhang with traditional trial components were replaced with a traditional implant ( group ii ) . therefore , the incidence of overhang after final implantation was 26/62 knees ( 41.9% ) in group i and no overhang ( 0/42 knees ) was observed in group ii . as a result , 
 36 knees in group i were able to avoid overhang with use of the gender - specific implants instead of the traditional ones , whereas the remaining 26 knees in group i still showed overhang even with gender - specific implants . 
 ten patients received a gender solutions prosthesis on one side and a lps - flex prosthesis on the other side . 
 the difference of the congruent patella tracking rom between traditional and gender - specific trial components was not significant ( p>0.05 ) ( table 3 ) . 
 hence , there was no case where a gender - specific implant was chosen for better patella tracking . 
 the distribution of the femoral component size ranged from c to e and showed a tendency of selecting larger sizes in the knees with the gender - specific implant ( p=0.045 ) ( table 4 ) . 
 clinical evaluation was performed in all patients including 10 patients who received different implants in bilateral tka . 
 the mean flexion contracture , mean maximal flexion and mean rom improved significantly after operation in both groups . 
 the mean hss score also improved after operation in both groups and the difference between two groups was not significant ( table 5 ) . 
 lateral release was not performed in both groups . at the final follow - up , 
 the mean patella tilt angle and mean patella displacement showed no significant difference between two groups ( table 6 ) . 
 we observed no clinical complications in both groups , including delayed wound healing , deep infection or instability . 
 no indications of component loosening and progressive osteolysis were noted in any zone on the postoperative radiographs . 
 in the present study , the incidence of overhang was reduced by 34.6% in the gender - specific implant group in which overhang was inevitable during trial insertion of the traditional implant . 
 however , clinical disadvantage of overhang was not demonstrated in the short - term follow - up . in 1996 , 
 poilvache et al.4 ) indicated some female femora were narrower than average and the available femoral component with adequate ap dimension might be too broad in these patients . 
 several years later , chin et al.1 ) investigated 200 consecutive knees ( 100 males and 100 females ) during primary tka and reported female femora showed a tendency to have a narrower ml dimension for any given ap dimension than male femora ( ap / ml ratio , 0.82 vs. 0.79 ) . shortly after this study , 
 hitt et al.2 ) performed a well - designed multicenter study enrolling 337 knees ( 128 males and 209 females ) to compare six different contemporary prosthetic systems of traditional design . 
 they reported that all the prostheses tended to present more or less ml overhang in female femora and the tendency was more evident in larger sizes . 
 moreover , they introduced the concept of aspect ratio ( ml / ap ratio ) and demonstrated that the aspect ratio of female femora tended to decrease in larger knees while male femora showed relatively constant aspect ratio throughout the sizes . 
 after this study , the aspect ratio became a standard parameter to describe distal femoral morphology . 
 they also stated manufacturers should consider gender - specific implants or decrease the ml dimension to prevent overhang in females . 
 stimulated by these reports , gender - specific implants were launched and marketed , which lead to the debate as to the relevance of this system6,7,11 ) . 
 proponents of gender - specific implants presented accumulated data on sexual dimorphism of distal femur during decades and possible negative effects of component overhang6,11 ) . on the contrary , opponents pointed out that most recent studies had failed to eliminate or correct for other biases between both sexes such as average height or size of the studied femora and concluded that the unproven use of gender - specific implants may pose ethical or medico - legal dilemmas7 ) . in spite of this , there seems to be no disagreement at least on one point that the reported studies had neither directly demonstrated negative effects of overhang or overstuffing nor investigated actual merits of gender - specific knee arthroplasty with real implants . 
 the paucity of data on negative effects of overstuffing has been taken for granted due to the difficulty of measuring the amount of overhang and controlling multiple possible prognostic factors other than overhang . 
 however , no theoretical advantage was expected with regard to the overhang of femoral implant . 
 thus , we decided to investigate the reduced incidence of overhang in tka using gender - specific implants in asian female patients even though the practical advantage of reduced overhang remained unclear . in this study , the incidence of ml overhang after tka using traditional and gender - specific trial components showed a significant difference ( 59.6% vs. 25.0% ) . 
 in other words , 34.6% of the patients were able to avoid femoral component overhang because gender - specific implants were available . 
 regarding the incidence of 25.0% of overhang even with the gender - specific trial component , these patients would have had greater overhang if it had not been for a gender - specific implant . 
 with respect to the incidence of overhang in six separate areas , only distal medial cut surface did not show significant differences between two groups 
 . this may be attributable to our efforts to lateralize femoral components during operation in order to improve patella tracking regardless of the type of implant . 
 the distribution of selected sizes in each group showed a tendency of higher selection rate of a gender - specific implant in larger sizes ( p=0.045 ) . 
 our data is consistent with those of hitt et al.2 ) that showed a higher aspect ratio in smaller knees and a proportionally lower ratio in larger knees . 
 song et al.12 ) compared clinical and radiologic results of tka using gender - specific implants and conventional unisex design with a minimum follow - up of two years . 
 they found no difference in clinical and radiologic outcomes between two groups and concluded gender - specific implants demonstrated no advantage over standard unisex design . 
 guy et al.13 ) compared 50 males and 50 females to investigate the difference in the morphology of distal femur and the incidence of femoral component overhang . 
 the mean aspect ratio was larger in females ( 1.02 ) than males ( 0.98 ) ( p=0.005 ) . 
 standard implants in tka resulted in a significant increase of overhang in females in terms of both incidence and magnitude than did gender - specific implants . 
 tanavalee et al.14 ) performed a prospective study that compared standard and gender - specific implants with an average follow - up of two years . 
 the selection rate of gender - specific implants was significantly higher in females ( 60.8% ) than males ( 8.2% ) and significantly increased with increasing femoral size . 
 the latter finding was exactly concordant with that in our present study and the selection rate of gender - specific implants in females ( 60.8% ) was very similar to that of our study ( 59.6% ) . 
 they evaluated 122 knees in three subdivided groups ( 42 females with unisex implants , 41 males with unisex implants and 39 females with gender - specific implants ) and concluded that traditional unisex femoral components did not accurately match female anatomy . 
 however , they were not able to demonstrate better radiographic results with gender - specific implants . therefore , the overall conclusion of the study was similar to ours in that traditional femoral components did not seem pertinent to reproduce female anatomy and gender - specific components did not provide a perfect solution , either . 
 asymmetrical component sizes are known to be frequently used in bilateral tka , and the prevalence of which ranges from 6.7% by brown et al.16 ) to 31% by hitt et al.2 ) . in our study , 10 patients had a gender solutions prosthesis in one knee and a lps - flex prosthesis in the contralateral knee . 
 this accounted for 10/38 ( 26.3% ) of all bilateral surgeries in the present study . 
 not only the size but also the shape of both distal femora of a patient may be different from each other according to our data , which alerted us to the risk of the use of the same implant in bilateral tka . 
 we believe the phenomenon of asymmetric component implantation probably originated from the awareness of the fact that anatomy is different from one side to the other . 
 the clinical outcomes of two groups did not present significant differences in terms of motion , performance of patella and hss score in this study . 
 because these parameters are not considered to deteriorate rapidly in short term , long - term observation seems to be necessary to elucidate differences , if any , in clinical outcomes between two groups . 
 one of the limitations of this study is that it is not a true comparative study : implant selection relied on the extent of overhang of each trial femoral component and therefore the true independent clinical outcomes of each implant system were not thoroughly investigated . 
 besides , the minimum 3-year follow - up period may be considered insufficient to determine the longevity of clinical outcomes . however , this study is based on solid evidence from prospective data , which can be regarded as a strength of the study . in the present study , 
 the gender - specific femoral component explicitly reduced the incidence of overhang compared to the traditional femoral component . 
 however , we could not find any correlation between this apparent advantage and more favorable clinical and radiologic outcomes . 
 potential advantages of gender specific implants , such as avoidance of overstuffing in the patellofemoral joint , soft tissue irritation and anterior knee pain , were not identified in this study . 
 there was significant difference in the incidence of overhang of femoral component between the gender - specific implant and the traditional implant . 
 it was observed that 34.6% of the patients were able to avoid femoral component overhang with gender - specific implants . 
 after three years of follow - up , there was no significant difference in clinical and radiological outcomes between two groups . 
 potential advantages of gender specific implants , such as avoidance of overstuffing in the patellofemoral joint , soft tissue irritation and anterior knee pain , should be evaluated in a long - term follow - up study .","background designed present study order find gender specific implants reduce incidence overhang operation clinical radiological advantage gender specific implants traditional implants

 then , the knees were divided into two groups according to the type of the permanent femoral component they received . 
 clinical and radiological outcomes were compared between 2 groups at minimum 3 years after operation.resultsmean follow - up duration was 41.3 months ( range , 36 to 50 months ) . 
 sixty two knees ( 59.6% ) showed femoral overhang at least in one area with a traditional trial component , while 26 knees ( 25.0% ) did with a gender - specific trial component ( p<0.001 ) . in terms of range of motion , hospital for special surgery knee score , radiographic result , patella tilt angle and displacement , no significant difference was observed between two groups.conclusionsthe use of gender - specific implants substantially reduced the incidence of femoral overhang but did not demonstrate any clinical , functional or radiologic benefit in short - term follow - up ."
"corynebacterium urealyticum , a gram - positive bacillus , has been identified as the most frequent causative pathogen . 
 urinary stasis is highly likely to contribute to stone formation , because large - scale spontaneous precipitation of crystals occurs when a critical concentration ( e.g. , supersaturation ) is exceeded . 
 failed treatment of encrusted pyelitis in a transplanted kidney can cause graft failure or nephrectomy . to overcome urinary stasis with encrusted pyelitis in a transplanted kidney , we report surgical treatment by ileo - pelvic anastomosis without nephrectomy . 
 in addition , in this case , augmentation cystoplasty was performed to strengthen the atrophied bladder following tuberculosis . 
 a 51-year - old female patient received a kidney from her sister after a double nephrectomy owing to renal tuberculosis 12 years previously . at that time , the transplanted ureter was anastomosed to the ileum in the left lower abdomen with an ileal conduit on the opposite side . 
 the patient experienced no problems for 12 years . at a routine checkup , she complained of abdominal pain , gross hematuria , and increased debris in the ileal conduit . 
 her serum creatinine was elevated to 1.7 mg / dl ( normal , 0.6 to 1.1 mg / dl ) , and her transplanted kidney developed hydronephrosis with calcified debris observed by sonography ( fig . 
 neither hydronephrosis nor calcified debris had been observed 6 months before in a routine outpatient checkup . 
 abdominopelvic computed tomography revealed hydronephrosis with encrusted pyelitis and ureteritis in the transplanted kidney ( fig . 
 a cystogram showed that the bladder was not refluxed but had a small capacity ( 50 ml ) . 
 after 3 weeks , we operated to anastomose the transplanted renal pelvis to one end of the ileal conduit , performing augmentation cystoplasty with new ileum and to anastomosis the other end of the remnant ileum with the augmented bladder . 
 augmentation cystoplasty is a reconstructive technique for creating a compliant , large - capacity urinary storage unit to protect the upper urinary tract . 
 the operation was performed via a midline incision . because it was difficult to approach the major calices of the transplanted kidney in the left pelvic rim 
 , we anastomosed one end of the ileal conduit to the pelvis of the transplanted kidney in an end - to - end fashion . 
 the ileal conduit was lengthened by 30 cm to extend from the pelvis to the augmented bladder chimney . 
 after exposure of the urinary bladder , a transverse wide v - shaped cystostomy incision was created , with the apex approaching the anterior bladder neck and the base extending posteriorly past the midcoronal plane of the bladder dome . 
 a 20 cm segment of new ileum at least 15 cm proximal to the ileocecal junction was used for ileocystoplasty . for the small bowel , 
 a v - shaped plate was created by a side - to - side anastomosis with 2 - 0 vicryl . 
 a circumferential , continuous , full - thickness , single layer anastomosis of the bowel to the bladder was started posteriorly by using 2 - 0 braided absorbable sutures . 
 the other end of the ileal conduit was anastomosed through small separate ileotomies ( 1.5 cm length ) in the limb of the augmentation cystoplasty . 
 a follow - up cystogram showed increased bladder capacity to approximately 300 ml with well - preserved end - to - end anastomosis of the ileo - pelvic portion with the other end of one chimney of augmentation cystoplasty with the elongated ileal conduit ( figs . 3 , 4 ) . 
 the most common causative agent in the formation of infection stones is a urease - positive urinary tract infection . 
 less invasive methods are preferable to preserve the connection between the renal pelvis and the upper ureter . 
 ileo - pelvic anastomosis must be adjusted for patients with infection stones in the upper urinary tract after renal transplantation . an alternative way to prevent these infection stones 
 is to ensure a wider pathway through a ureter that has been narrowed in places by these stones . according to a report on the incidence of urolithiasis in cystectomy patients , 5 of 78 patients who had undergone diversion with an intestinal conduit developed urolithiasis , all in the upper tract . 
 in contrast , 4 of 78 patients who had received a diversion had a renal stone at the time of presentation 
 . refluxing urine may contribute to an increased risk of stone formation after urinary diversion , whereas pouch stasis may contribute to stone formation in the diversion group . 
 a case of failed treatment of encrustation in a kidney transplant recipient was reported and graft removal was performed after 6 months of failed management owing to intractable febrile urinary tract infections that became life threatening . 
 they excised renal parenchyma from the caudal portion of the inferior calyx , which was then anastomosed to the ileostomy . in their case , 
 bladder capacity was within the normal limit ; thus , augmentation cystoplasty was not indicated . in conclusion , if urinary tract infection is controlled , we suggest that ileo - pelvic anastomosis   combined with augmentation cystoplasty   is an alternative for the treatment of encrusted pyelitis with atrophied bladder . in our patient , we performed ileo - pelvic anastomosis to prevent urinary stasis by elongating the ileal conduit . 
 in addition , the augmentation cystoplasty technique is useful for increasing bladder capacity that has been diminished by renal tuberculosis ( fig .","weeks operated anastomose transplanted renal pelvis one end ileal conduit performing augmentation cystoplasty new ileum anastomosis end remnant ileum augmented bladder
follow cystogram showed increased bladder capacity approximately ml well preserved end end anastomosis ileo pelvic portion end one chimney augmentation cystoplasty elongated ileal conduit figs
conclusion urinary tract infection controlled suggest ileo pelvic anastomosis combined augmentation cystoplasty alternative treatment encrusted pyelitis atrophied bladder
patient performed ileo pelvic anastomosis prevent urinary stasis elongating ileal conduit","infection stones are more likely to form after urinary diversion as the result of urinary stasis . to prevent urinary stasis due to encrusted pyelitis in a transplanted kidney 
 , we describe an alternative a surgical treatment : ileo - pelvic anastomosis . in our patient with a transplanted kidney , 
 the ileal conduit had previously been anastomosed end - to - side owing to renal tuberculosis with an atrophied bladder ; the transplanted ureter was anastomosed to the ileum in the left lower abdomen with an ileal conduit on the opposite side . 
 routine check - up revealed hydronephrosis with infected pyelitis and ureteritis in the transplanted kidney . 
 we performed ileo - pelvic end - to - end anastomosis to prevent urinary stasis by lengthening the ileal conduit and performed augmentation cystoplasty to support the atrophied bladder following tuberculosis . 
 we suggest that this approach may be useful in similar cases ."
"subcellular localization is a key feature for characterizing physiological functions of proteins : in eukaryotes compartmentalization finalizes the sets of possible interacting molecules and therefore the biological process(es ) in which a protein is involved . 
 to date it has been carried out only for a narrow subset of known proteins . presently only unicellular species have been extensively analyzed by means of high - throughput experiments , such as s.cerevisiae ( 1,2 ) . 
 different approaches , such as green fluorescent protein ( gfp)-tagging ( 2 ) and immunoluminescence ( 1 ) , agree only on 75% of the annotations and this is mainly due to experimental limitations and possible interference of the tagging procedures on the normal protein trafficking ( 3,4 ) . 
 although it is difficult to scale these techniques to more complex organisms , a partial map for mouse liver cells was recently produced ( 5 ) . 
 curated annotations of the subcellular localization , although probably not covering all the available experimental knowledge , are contained in the swissprot database . 
 the amount of proteins with an experimental annotation listed in swissprot is different for different species and reaches at the most half of the total amount of proteins in a genome ( see below ) . 
 the question remains , however , as to how one can obtain a reliable annotation of subcellular localization for the rest of the proteins . 
 although in principle a change in few residues could result in a change of the localization of a protein , in practice with very few exceptions natural proteins with a sequence identity > 30% share the same localization ( 68 ) . in the most successful cases , 
 about two - thirds of a genome can be annotated both by experimental results and similarity search . 
 many predictors have been developed recently [ ( 4,711 ) , a list is available at ] . 
 a prerequisite for a predictive method is its capability of well performing when the query sequence shares very low sequence similarity to known proteins . 
 it is therefore important to implement and adopt predictors tested with a rigorous cross - validation procedure on sets of proteins < 30% identical with respect to the sequences used for the training . 
 another important feature to be considered in adopting a predictor is how the relative abundance of localization among different sub - compartments was treated during the training phase . indeed , with the available data it is difficult to estimate the real proportions between the proteins targeted into the different subcellular localizations ; most of the predictive methods tend in fact to overestimate localization types for which more examples are known ( 8) . 
 it is therefore necessary to adopt predictive methods that attempt to correct bias towards one or more localization classes . 
 they include ( i ) the results of large - scale experiments for the determination of subcellular localization in specific organisms [ ygfp ( 1 ) , for yeast ; and ormdb ( 5 ) , for mouse ] ; ( ii ) the annotations of proteins to be found in organelles [ plprot ( 12 ) , for proteins from plastids ; organelledb ( 13 ) , for proteins in different organelles ; and mitop2 ( 14 ) , for mitochondrial proteins ] . 
 a database collecting all the annotations listed in swissprot is also available [ dbsubloc ( 15 ) ] . 
 finally databases that implement predictors of subcellular localization based on different methods have been reported [ loctarget ( 16 ) and pa - gosub ( 17 ) ] . 
 loctarget ( 16 ) is specific for structural genomics targets and lists some 50  000 proteins from different organisms . 
 pa - gosub ( 17 ) contains the annotations of eukaryotic subcellular localization and protein function of different genomes and is based on homology search and bayesian artificial networks for prediction . 
 we recently developed bacello , a well - performing balanced method for the prediction of subcellular localization , outperforming previously existing methods for the same task ( 8) . 
 we adopt bacello to annotate whole genomes in association with methods specifically implemented for the prediction of the topology of integral membrane proteins . in this paper 
 we present eukaryotic subcellular localization database ( esldb ) , a database of protein subcellular localization which provides an annotation for the entire proteomes of eukaryotic organisms . for each sequence 
 our database contains the experimental localization , when available , the homology - based annotation , when feasible , and the predicted localization computed with the in - house developed machine learning based methods . by this the new database provides more features than other existing databases . to date , five proteomes were fully processed : homo sapiens , mus musculus , caenorhabditis elegans , saccharomyces cerevisiae and arabidopsis thaliana . in summary , esldb is , to our knowledge , the first database containing the available experimental and similarity - based annotations for eukaryotic proteomes listing for each protein sequence also the predicted subcellular localization . 
 five different genomes were downloaded as specified : h.sapiens ( ensembl ncbi36 ) , m.musculus ( ensembl ncbim36 ) , s.cerevisiae ( ensembl sgd1 ) , c.elegans ( ensembl cel150 ) and a.thaliana ( tair6 ) . for each protein 
 the corresponding swissprot entry in release 50 was found , when existing , searching for exactly matching sequences . 
 the amount of genomic sequences that is deposited in the swissprot database ranges from 13% for both a.thaliana and c.elegans to 79% for s.cerevisiae ( table 1 ) . 
 number of proteins with an experimental or a similarity - based annotation of the subcellular localization the sequences experimentally annotated are included among those annotated by similarity . for these proteins the experimental annotation was extracted by parsing the 
 the annotations directly or implicitly referring to one of the following 17 classes were taken into account : nucleus , cytoplasm , mitochondrion , plastid , golgi , endoplasmic reticulum , lysosome , endosome , vesicles , peroxisome , vacuole , cell wall , secretory pathway , extracellular , cytoskeleton , membrane and transmembrane ( table 1 in supplementary data lists the keywords that have been considered for assigning the localization ) . 
 only 22% of all the swissprot entries for the five considered species record the experimental subcellular localization . 
 the rate of experimental annotation ranges from 46% of the s.cerevisiae proteome to < 10% for a.thaliana and c.elegans ( table 1 ) . 
 the  experimental annotation column in table 2 lists the amount of proteins experimentally annotated in each one of the 17 types of considered localization . 
 it is worth mentioning that the same sequence can be annotated in swissprot with two ( or rarely more ) different localizations . 
 for example , this happens for proteins that shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm . in these cases 
 it is evident that the amount of proteins in the different localizations spans two orders of magnitude . 
 number of sequences in the 17 different subcellular localizations as derived with experimental and similarity - based annotations the sequences experimentally annotated are included among those annotated by similarity . 
 the best way to annotate the remaining proteins is to search for experimentally annotated sequences sharing high identity ( 68 ) . 
 since the three eukaryotic kingdoms ( metazoa , viridiplantae and fungi ) differ in number and types of possible localizations , three kingdom - specific datasets of annotated proteins were extracted from swissprot . 
 these dataset contains 26  192 sequences for metazoa , 6370 sequences for viridiplantae and 4023 sequences for fungi . 
 all the sequences of the five considered genomes were searched for similar sequences in the appropriate dataset using blast ( 18 ) . when matches were found with an e - value < 10 ( roughly corresponding to an identity level > 30% ) the annotation of the best - scoring match was transferred to the query sequence . when multiple matches are found with the same best scoring e - value , 
 similarity - based annotation column in table 2 contains the number of proteins annotated with the above described procedure in each localization ( including the sequences experimentally annotated ) . 
 also in this case , sequences that end up with a multiple annotation are counted several times . 
 it appears that a large portion of the sequences , ranging from 32% in h.sapiens up to 67% in a.thaliana , is not endowed with similar counterparts with an annotated localization . in this case 
 subcellular localization can be predicted with specifically suited methods . for generating our annotation system we developed a pipeline that comprises previously described methods , 
 all based on machine learning tools and that are proved to outperform most of the available predictors for the same task when rigorous cross - validation procedures are adopted ( 8) . the pipeline is shown in figure 1 . 
 first of all , membrane proteins are discriminated with spep ( 19 ) and ensemble ( 20 ) : the former is a neural network based method for predicting the presence of signal peptide while the latter is a method based on neural networks and hidden markov models for the prediction of the topology of all - alpha transmembrane proteins . 
 when a signal peptide is predicted , it is cleaved from the sequence before predicting the presence and the location of the transmembrane helices . 
 if no transmembrane helix is found , the uncleaved sequence is analyzed using bacello ( 8) , a recently developed tool for predicting the subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins . 
 this is based on a decision tree of support vector machines and it discriminates four localizations in metazoa and fungi ( cytoplasm , nucleus , extracellular and mitochondrion ) and five localizations in viridiplantae ( the same as before plus chloroplast ) . 
 bacello , spep and ensemble are predictive methods described previously ( 8,17,18 ) . at the end of the pipeline up 
 to five localizations can be discriminated in metazoa and fungi and up to six in viridiplantae . although the possible types of localization are 17 ( see above ) , the actual reduction in the number of discriminated localization is due to the lack of an adequate number of non - redundant examples for training . 
 a novelty of bacello is that first takes into consideration that the actual proportion of proteins targeted towards each compartment remains unknown by adopting an equiprobability hypothesis and a balancing procedure ( 8) . the structure of the predictive system allows annotating the subcellular localization in a hierarchical way . 
 first , all membrane proteins are separated from soluble ones ; the latter are then divided into intracellular and secreted . 
 intracellular proteins are separated in nucleocytoplasmic and organellar ; the former are then separated in cytoplasmic and nuclear while the latter , in the case of viridiplantae , are further divided into mitochondrial and chloroplastic . 
 the topology of the decision tree and the balancing procedure were adopted for maximizing the prediction performances as evaluated on testing sets independent of the training sets . 
 the best scoring binary decisions are at the top of the tree , the worst - scoring at the bottom . 
 the predictions are stored in the database along with the hierarchy of the decisions in the pipeline . 
 all the proteins of a genome , also when experimental and/or homology - based annotation are possible , are annotated by means of the predictive method . in table 3 
 number of sequences in the six predicted subcellular localizations table 4 contains the evaluation of the coverage and the accuracy of the prediction for the proteins of h.sapiens , as compared with both the experimental and the similarity derived annotations . 
 we considered 6444 unique proteins experimentally annotated and 25 134 unique sequences for which a similarity - based annotation is available . 
 the coverage is computed as the fraction of correctly predicted sequences in each class over the number of proteins belonging to the class . 
 the accuracy is the fraction of correctly predicted proteins over the total number of proteins predicted in the class . 
 the agreement between the annotations and the prediction is good , especially when predictions are compared with the experimental annotations and the higher levels of the hierarchical prediction are considered . 
 performance of the prediction pipeline as compared with the experimental and the similarity - based annotations the indentation of the subcellular localization names reflects the hierarchy of the prediction ( see figure 1 ) . 
 coverage = ( no . of proteins of class i predicted as class i)/(total no . 
 all the data are available at the website ( ) and can be accessed by protein code , as derived from the original and above - mentioned versions of the genomic databases , or by protein description , as derived from the swissprot entries . alternatively the sequence of interest can be submitted and , by means of the md5 encoding , the match engine searches for identical sequences deposited in the database . 
 moreover , complex searches can be performed combining the different annotation methods and the different localizations . 
 the entries matching the query keys can either be displayed or downloaded in a tabular format that contains the experimental and the similarity - derived annotation and the localization prediction for each match . 
 pages containing more details about each one of the proteins ( figure 2 ) are linked to the protein codes and contain the sequence , the description and the link to the swissprot file when an experimental annotation exists . 
 when the sequence can be annotated by similarity , the swissprot entry corresponding to the most similar sequence is reported together with the e - value as computed by blast ( 18 ) . in both the tabular and the detailed pages 
 , the results of the prediction are given together with the complete path through the decision tree . 
 this information can be useful since , as we commented in the previous section , the accuracy of the prediction lowers as the number of discriminated classes increases . 
 this means that annotations in the macro - classes are endowed with a higher reliability . 
 all the data contained in the database can be freely downloaded in flat file format . 
 the database resides in a postgresql server and the web interface has been implemented using python , html 4.0 and css 2.0 languages . 
 more available eukaryotic proteomes are currently under process and will be added to the database . 
 moreover we plan to regularly update the database as new versions of swissprot or new releases of the considered proteomes will be available .

"in a contemporary health - care environment characterized by rapidly changing developments and relentlessly increasing knowledge , professional nurses need to develop critical thinking ( ct ) skills that will provide them with expertise in flexible , individualized , situation - specific problem - solving . 
 ct has been defined as  a nonlinear and cycled process that allows people to make decisions on what to believe and what to do within a given context . 
 according to kostovich et al . , the ability to think critically is an essential attribute for today 's nurses , and the development of this skill in nursing students requires multiple approaches and techniques . 
 use of the nursing process is an essential element to cultivate ct and judgment skills in nursing students . 
 the nursing process is a nonlinear , dynamic activity , which focuses on the multifaceted aspects of a patient , their family , and the environment . 
 nurses and nursing students must develop and write nursing care plans to provide and organize nursing interventions based upon identified patients needs . 
 however , some researchers have reported that the current linear nursing care plan format does not meet the educational needs of students to develop ct skills and visualize the interconnectedness of patient clinical data . 
 in addition , nurse educators feel that the nursing care plans developed by students are not case sensitive and need in - depth comprehension of each client 's physical , psychological , social , and spiritual health . in the authors program , 
 the traditional linear format nursing care plan used in the first five semesters was found not to meet the needs of sixth - semester nursing students . 
 these students need to be able to quickly conceptualize the plan of care in a functional format as they graduate and enter the practice arena , where they will be expected to care for multiple patients simultaneously and to rapidly use the nursing process to develop a nursing plan of care based upon priority needs of these patients . 
 concept map development is an alternative to using care plans as a method to document a plan of care based on evidenced - based practices . 
 , learners assimilate new concepts into their existing cognitive structure . when new concepts are integrated by identifying relationships with concepts already possessed , learning becomes meaningful . 
 hence , concept maps provide a format to visualize physiological , pathological , and psychological relationships and interactions in a concrete fashion . 
 visualization of patient care priorities through a holistic view of the patient can be achieved through concept mapping . 
 in addition , the minimal use of text or words makes it easy to scan for a word , phrase , or the general idea that is being explored . 
 some studies have explored the short - term effects of concept map teaching on students ct and found positive effects in clinical or classroom teaching . 
 concept mapping has also been described in an online course on  distance education to adults  in nursing to assess thinking processes of the students where it was found that they helped the students to self - assess their own thinking processes , thus facilitating reflective practice . 
 it has also identified by gerdeman et al . to improve clinical judgment skills in nursing students . however , contrary to previous positive results , some other studies reported contradictory results , for example in a quasi - experimental study , wheeler and collins found that the experimental group scored significantly higher on the overall analysis and evaluation scores in the pre and posttest comparisons , but no significant differences between the groups were found . 
 yeh and chen also found no significant differences of ct scores between their experimental and control groups , and one longitudinal study on concept mapping , conducted in a united states medical school with 1 year medical students , found no significant differences between ct scores in the pre- and post - tests . 
 possible explanations for the findings of these studies may stem from several factors , such as measurement error , instrumentation , the curriculum and various definition of ct adopted by the studies . on the other hand , some studies indicate that ct skill of nursing students in different countries had been different . 
 in iran , it can be stated that although ct is important in clinical judgments and decisions but during the training period , have had no significant development therefore the traditional education system needs evolution and revision in order to realize training purposes in line with fostering creative and efficient students . with regard to the need for finding best way to promote nursing students ct and the limited evidence of comparing concept mapping with traditional nursing care plan in clinical setting 
 , this study was performed to compare the effect of concept mapping with traditional nursing care plan on nursing students ct in clinical pediatric course . 
 a before - after experimental design with the control group was used to compare the effect of concept mapping and traditional linear nursing care planning on baccalaureate nursing student 's ct skills at shahrekord university of medical sciences in shahrekord , iran . 
 all 60 students from the nursing faculty of the shahrekord university of medical sciences , shahrekord , iran , who had enrolled in pediatric nursing clinical course , and in sixth - semester of their study in the year 2011 , were invited to participate in this study . 
 students were randomly divided into six equal groups of 10 students ; three groups as the control group and the other three groups as an experimental group . to prevent contact between the control and experimental groups , they take the pediatric clinical course in sequential time order . during the course 
 , students cared for patients from an assigned pediatric setting . because students were not able to have prior contact with their patients , they began developing their nursing care plans on the 1 day of their clinical experience . 
 they were asked to create a nursing care plan for a child they were caring for , which required gathering information on complete patient histories , relevant medications , treatments and medical diagnoses . 
 on the 2 day of clinical experience , clinical instructor who has the experience of concept mapping development taught the students in the experimental group how to create concept maps . 
 the students were informed in advance that a concept map should display each nursing diagnosis and more importantly , its relationship to the patient 's data , pathophysiology of the disease and interventions in a holistic view . 
 students were required to analyze assessment data and identify nursing diagnoses , relevant pathophysiology and interventions related to those diagnoses . 
 they used diagrams , color , and shapes to code the parts of the nursing process . 
 they also had 5 days after the clinical experience to reflect on and evaluate the effectiveness of their nursing care before the concept maps were due . 
 each student in the experimental group created nine concept maps during the course . during clinical group discussions 
 this activity provided all students with the opportunity to think out aloud about the accuracy and completeness of the nursing diagnoses , goals , nursing interventions and relationship depicted on their concept maps . 
 a sample concept map demonstrated by student students in the control group received traditional clinical teaching to create linear nursing care plans on a blank sheet . 
 the students were asked to read and analyze the patient profile data , formulate initial problems , prioritize nursing diagnoses and identify the relationship between nursing diagnoses , then develop and implement interventions to solve the problems , and to evaluate the effectiveness of their nursing care . 
 linear care plans were in text format without using any shapes , propositions or arrow to illustrate the interconnectedness between the data , nursing diagnosis and interventions . 
 they also had the opportunity to discuss their care plans in group discussion with guidance provided by the teacher . 
 nobody in the control group asked about concept mapping showing that control groups did not contaminate with the intervention by experimental groups . a well - known , validated and reliable tool was selected for this study . 
 ct skills were measured using the california critical thinking skill test ( cctst ) with subscales of analysis ( 9 items ) , evaluation ( 14 items ) , inference ( 11 items ) , and two types of reasoning ( deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning included 16 and 14 items respectively ) . 
 we selected this scale because it was tested for reliability and validity in iranian nursing students . 
 khalili and hossein zadeh reported that this scale in comparison with the other measuring tools of ct is more comprehensive . 
 the reliability coefficient of subscales after factor analysis in their study was in the range of 62 - 67% . 
 ( l4 items ) note that a kr-20 range of 0.650.75 for this type of instrument is acceptable . 
 this instrument contains 34 items in multiple - choice format , 19 four - option multiple - choice items and 15 five - option multiple - choice items . 
 the range of possible total scores was 034 , with each subscale having a possible score range of 012 . 
 an overall score of < 11 indicated a lack of ct skills , a score of 1125 indicated average ct skills , and a score above 25 indicated strong ct skills . for a given ct skill , a subscale score of 4 or less indicated weakness , whereas a subscale score of 7 or above indicated strength . 
 data were collected before and after the program in a clinical setting at the beginning and end of clinical education . 
 agreement to use and evaluate concept mapping as a teaching strategy in clinical courses was obtained from the nursing department of shahrekord university of medical sciences , shahrekord , iran . 
 information about the study was given to every participant to assure the protection of human rights by the clinical teacher . 
 participants in the experimental group were informed that they would be free to change to the traditional teaching strategy at any time without effects on their course evaluation . to ensure students in the control group were not disadvantaged , after completing the study , they were taught concept mapping during a 1-day workshop .

 ( l4 items ) note that a kr-20 range of 0.650.75 for this type of instrument is acceptable . 
 this instrument contains 34 items in multiple - choice format , 19 four - option multiple - choice items and 15 five - option multiple - choice items . 
 the range of possible total scores was 034 , with each subscale having a possible score range of 012 . 
 an overall score of < 11 indicated a lack of ct skills , a score of 1125 indicated average ct skills , and a score above 25 indicated strong ct skills . for a given ct skill , a subscale score of 4 or less indicated weakness , whereas a subscale score of 7 or above indicated strength . 
 data were collected before and after the program in a clinical setting at the beginning and end of clinical education . 
 agreement to use and evaluate concept mapping as a teaching strategy in clinical courses was obtained from the nursing department of shahrekord university of medical sciences , shahrekord , iran . 
 information about the study was given to every participant to assure the protection of human rights by the clinical teacher . 
 participants in the experimental group were informed that they would be free to change to the traditional teaching strategy at any time without effects on their course evaluation . to ensure students in the control group were not disadvantaged , after completing the study , they were taught concept mapping during a 1-day workshop . 
 data analysis was performed using statistical package for the social sciences ( spssinc . , chicago , il , usa ) software . in all analyses , p - 0.05 
 we used independent and paired t - tests to compare mean scores between the experimental and control groups at pre- and post - tests . 
 almost all students were 21 years old except one who was 22 years old ( range : 2122 ) . 
 the statistical analysis showed that two groups did not appreciably differ in age or sex . 
 there was no significant difference between the groups overall , and in all subscales before the program [ table 1 ] . 
 paired t - test showed significant improvement in overall and all subscales of cctst from pretest to posttest in both groups ( p < 0.001 ) [ tables 2 and 3 ] but t - test demonstrates that improvement in students ct skills in the experimental group was significantly greater than that in the control group after the program ( p < 0.001 ) [ table 4 ] . 
 student 's ct skills on the pretest comparison of overall and subscales of cctst - a in the experimental group comparison of overall and subscales of cctst - a in the control group student s ct skills on the posttest 
 this study was developed to examine whether concept mapping helped students develop better ct skills than the traditional method in an undergraduate pediatric clinical course . in the current study 
 , it was found that either concept map or traditional linear nursing care plan could promote ct skills in nursing students from lacking to an average ct standard . 
 however , similar to findings of other prior studies which observed improvements to nurses ct abilities following a concept mapping teaching strategy , the present study provided evidence to indicate that the effects of concept mapping were greater than those of traditional linear nursing care plans , with greater improvements to students overall and all subscales of ct skills as indicated by cctst scores . considering that the test of ct is based on the problem - solving process and the nursing process in the defined problem - solving stages , the use of which could improve ct skills . 
 the ct skills overall describe overall strength in using reasoning to form reflective judgments about what to believe or what to do and includes core reasoning skills such as analysis , inference , evaluation , induction , and deduction . 
 analytical reasoning skills enable people to identify the elements of a situation and determine how these parts interact . in the nursing process , students identify bio - psycho - social aspects of patients health and determine how these parts interact . in our study , students tried to understand the relationship between patient data , nursing process , interactions and connections between sign and symptoms , diagnostic data and medications as they developed traditional care plans or concept maps . 
 although both care plans and concept maps could reinforce the students analytical reasoning skills , concept mapping had a greater effect . according to cook et al . , the linear format of the nursing care plan is based upon the nursing process that does not always allow for a holistic picture of patient needs and does not allow for visualization of the interrelatedness of patient data . 
 in contrast , concept maps provide a format to visualize physiological , pathophysiological and psychological relationships and interactions in a concrete fashion , which is more effective to support quality analysis . 
 schuster also suggested that visualization of patient care priorities through a holistic view of the patient can be achieved through concept mapping . 
 nirmala and shakuntala also supported that the cross - links in concept maps are useful for correlating patients diagnoses , symptoms , treatment and interventions and then to thinking critically in clinical decision - making . according to facione et al . 
 inductive reasoning helps in isolating the cause of an ailment or arriving at a theory to explain the relationship between symptoms . 
 evaluative reasoning skills enable students to assess the credibility of resources of information and the claims they make . in our study , after the 5 weeks program , the concept mapping participants demonstrated greater ct abilities to assess the credibility of , and relationships between statements and to provide reasoning according to evidence and using deduction , comprehend , express and clarify meaning and to perform inductive reasoning tasks . 
 similar to some previous studies ( yeh and chen ) , our study found that the experimental group had significantly higher scores of inference and deduction than those of the control group in the posttest . when constructing concept maps , students need to draw logical conclusions from factual knowledge or promises known through a process of inference such as identifying the major concepts , determining the relationship between concepts and making propositions using cross - links before coming to conclusions . in summary , converting to a concept map format allow for visualization of all aspects of patient clinical data , physical assessment , disease process and the relationship between this information , facilitating ct in nursing students in a clinical area . 
 previous researches on the ct of nursing students in iranian faculties showed that learning in the educational system takes place at the initial cognitive levels , and higher levels such as analysis or synthesis and evaluation are less addressed . 
 in fact , less attention is paid to the growth of the ct power according to kermansaravi et al . 
 there are main and serious obstacles in the development of ct , one of which is the predominant use of traditional teaching methods in the current education system which is preventing from the development of decision making and troubleshooting ( or problem - solving ) skills in the learners and as a result limits the opportunities for students ct . considering that the test of ct is based on the problem - solving process and the nursing process is the defined problem - solving stages , the use of which is one - way emphasized in nursing education programs to the growth of ct . 
 our study suggested that preparing nursing care using the concept map is more effective in promoting ct in nursing students than traditional linear nursing care plans . 
 as with all studies with small samples , generalization of findings must be made cautiously . 
 however , this study adds to the growing body of knowledge that suggests concept mapping improves students abilities to see patterns and relationships . 
 although this study identified some short - term effects of the concept mapping program , its long - term effects remain unknown . 
 the sample set came from only one university in iran limiting the feasibility of generalization of results to other universities and countries . 
 future investigations should include multisite evaluations in a range of geographic locales with larger sample sizes .

 future investigations should include multisite evaluations in a range of geographic locales with larger sample sizes . 
 when presented with complex health - care situations and the need to process vast amounts of information , clinical nurses must be in ownership of ct skills in order to make appropriate professional judgments and clinical decision making . 
 results from the present study support the application of concept mapping as a clinical teaching strategy to promote the development of ct skills . 
 concept mapping , in comparison with the traditional linear nursing care plan , resulted in greater improvements in all ct skills . 
 however , the 5 weeks program demonstrated only short - term effects , therefore , further longitudinal studies are suggested .

"synthesis of metal nanoparticles with the help of plant extracts is an emerging field of nanotechnology , due to their novel properties , terrific applications in biomedicine and its eco - friendly nature . in recent past 
 great efforts were made for synthesis of environment benign and eco - friendly nanoparticle from plants such as iron oxide nanoparticles from medicago sativa , copper nanoparticles from magnolia kobus , calcium nanoparticles from boswellia ovalifoliolata , gold nanoparticles from avena sativa , zinc oxide nanoparticles from catharanthus roseus , and silver nanoparticles ( agnps ) from syzygium alternifolium . 
 silver is one among the metal nanoparticles focused much interest due to its wide variety of applications . 
 it has different biological activities such as antimicrobial , anthelmintic , antilarvicidic , antioxidant , anticancer , anti - inflammatory , hepatoprotective , and wound healing activity . 
 conventional methods for synthesizing agnps are mainly by chemical , physical , and microbe - mediated synthesis . in these chemical and physical methods , usage of hazardous chemicals , high energy requirements , 
 difficult and wasteful materials generate potential and biological hazards to the environment . whereas in the case of microbe - mediated synthesis 
 . therefore biological synthesis of agnps by using plant materials is easy , efficient , and eco - friendliness in comparison to chemical mediated or microbe - mediated synthesis   and they possess secondary metabolites having the redox capacity to reduce metal nanoparticles in an easiest way . 
 adansonia digitata l. belongs to the family malvaceae is a large tree indigenous to africa and found in many countries also . 
 traditionally , the fruit pulp dissolved in water or milk is used as a drink or sauce for food in africa . 
 fruit pulp and powdered seeds are used for the treatment of diarrhea and dysentery in india . 
 the high content of vitamin c in fruit pulp is recommended to pregnant women s for daily intake . in recent times , different scientists prove different activities of pulp such as hepatoprotective , antimicrobial , antiviral , antioxidant , antidiarrheal , hypoglycemic , anti - inflammatory , and antioxidant   activities . due to high medicinal values and mythological significance of this plant 
 is known as  kalpavriksha  ( a tree which fulfill all desires ) in india . in our previous studies , 
 synthesis of agnps from stem bark and leaf extract of a. digitata acts as excellent reducing agents and show potential antimicrobial activity against different microorganisms . 
 however , the potentiality of fruit pulp mediated synthesis of agnps is not carried out so far . 
 hence , the present study is aimed to synthesize agnps from a. digitata fruit pulp extract , characterize and to know the potentiality of agnps against different microbial pathogens . 
 2 to 4 kg weight mature fruits possess a great amount of pulp is collected from acharya ranga agricultural university , tirupati and cross checked by herbarium ( voucher no : svu362 ) deposited in department of botany , sri venkateswara university , tirupati . 
 cut open the fruit and separate the seeds adhesive to pulp . grounded the collected pulp with the help of mortar and pestle , sieved the content for the synthesis of nanoparticles . for synthesis , 25 g of fruit pulp is extracted with 100 ml of distilled water on boiling water bath for 30 min , filter the content with whatman no .

 the plates are incubated at 37c for 24 - 48 h , and then the zone of inhibition is measured with the help of a scale and tabulated the results . 
 reduction of ag into ag nanoparticles was observed visually by means of a color change pattern of the reaction medium . 
 a. digitata fruit pulp having thick cream color , upon synthesis the color change from creamy to light yellow indicates the formation of nanoparticles . 
 this color changed nanoparticles solution was analyzed by uv - vis spectrophotometry shows a broad absorption peak at 434 nm further confirms the formation of nanoparticles are agnps [ figure 1 ] . 
 ftir spectroscopic studies of these synthesized nanoparticles show broad transmittance peaks at 3322 cm assigned for an o - h bond of phenols and 1636 cm assigned for an n - h bond of primary amines [ figure 2 ] . 
 xrd spectrum of synthesized agnps shows the crystalline nature of agnps and gives four intensive peaks at 38.1 , 46.2 , 64.5 , and 77.3 of 2 degrees of x - axis corresponds to 111 , 200 , 220 , and 311 bragg reflections of y - axis [ figure 3 ] . 
 the mean particle diameter of synthesized agnps is 44 nm , calculated according to debye - scherrer equation ( d = k/ cos  ) and it coincides with powder diffraction file of joint committee on powder diffraction standards file no . 
 the full width at half maximum values , i.e. k = 0.44 was derived from 38 , 46 , 64 , and 77 bragg reflections of the x - axis . 2 m resolution studies of biologically synthesized agnps with afm reveal the particles are polydispersed , spherical in shape , having the size range from 25 to 57 nm , and there is no agglomeration observed between the particles [ figure 4a ] . 
 raw data obtained from this afm microscope is treated with a specially designed image processing software ( nova - tx ) to further exploit the three - dimensional ( 3d ) image of nanoparticles [ figure 4b ] . 
 500 nm resolution studies with 20 kv electron energy passing through the nanoparticles coated thin films on a clean glass slide reveals the nanoparticles are spherical in shape , polydispersed and having the size range from 18 to 32 nm [ figure 5a ] . the same sample was analyzed with the help of edax instrument shows 33.28% presence of ag in the sample [ figure 5b ] along with 05.29% of carbon , 03.28% of nitrogen , 31.80% of oxygen , 08.37% of sodium , 02.57% of magnesium , 01.01% of aluminum , 00.78% of silicon , 07.87% of aurum , and 05.74% of calcium [ table 1 ] . 
 crystalline nature of synthesized agnps was analyzed using selected area electron diffraction ( saed ) by directing the electron beam perpendicular to nanoparticles . 
 the saed pattern of synthesized agnps shows the spots had been corresponding to 111 , 200 , 220 , and 311 of the crystallographic nature of face - centered cubic structures [ figure 6a ] . 20 nm resolution studies with 300 kv electron energy passing through nanoparticles coated thin films on copper grid show the nanoparticles are polydispersed , spherical in shape and size range from 3 to 7 nm [ figure 6b ] . to know the antimicrobial potency of biologically synthesized agnps from fruit pulp of a. digitata 
 was analyzed against two gram - positive , five gram - negative , and five fungal pathogens by disc diffusion method . among the bacterial pathogens , 
 the highest inhibition zones were observed in p. vulgaris followed by k. pneumoniae , p. aeruginosa , s. typhimurium , e. coli , b. subtilis , and s. aureus . whereas in the case of fungi , the highest inhibition zones were observed in t. harzianum , followed by a. niger , a. flavus , p. chrysogenum , and a. solani . 
 ultraviolet - vis spectrum of synthesized silver nanoparticles shows broad peak at 434 , 280 , and 247 nm of narrow peaks is due interference of phytoconstituents in the medium .

 when the addition of agno3 solution to the plant extract the color of the plant extract is changed gradually according to the quantitative addition of agno3 solution . 
 this color change is due to the reduction of nanoparticles with the help of electrons present in the fruit pulp extract coming from nad and ascorbic acid as electron donors present in the plant extracts . 
 significantly higher amount of ascorbic acid , i.e. , > 300 mg/100 g was reported in fruit pulp of a. digitata . 
 this solution was subjected to uv - vis spectrophotometry between the scan ranges of 190 - 750 nm , a broad peak is obtained at 434 nm . the same type of results was observed in leaf extract mediated synthesis of agnps from couroupita guianensis . 
 the color change pattern and broad peak obtained in uv - vis spectrophotometry are due to surface plasmon resonance nature of agnps present in the medium . 
 these nanoparticles absorb light at different wavelengths and excited due to charge density at the interface between conductor and insulator to give a respective peak on uv - vis spectrophotometry . 
 ft - ir is a sensitive tool to analyze functional groups present in the biological samples . 
 it relies on the light absorbance between 4000 cm to 500 cm of the electromagnetic , infrared region . in our case , 
 the same type of results was observed in myristica fragrans seed extract mediated synthesis of agnps . from this ftir study , clearly reveals hydroxyl groups of phenols and amide groups of proteins from plant extract forming a layer to the nanoparticles and acting as a capping agent to prevent agglomeration and providing stability in the medium . 
 based on these ftir studies , we suggest that the bio - molecules present in plant extracts play dual role in formation and stabilization to agnps . 
 afm is a primary tool for analyzing size , shape , agglomeration pattern and also offers visualizations of 3d views of the nanoparticles , unlike the electron microscopes . 
 it has an advantage over combination of hr , samples do not have to be conductive and does not require the high - pressure vacuum conditions . 
 better resolution and percentage presence of nanoparticles were demonstrated by sem with edax instrument provides reliable characterization and morphology of the particles when compare to afm . 
 the four intensive bragg reflections are appear in xrd pattern [ figure 3 ] is correlated with saed pattern [ figure 6a ] of agnps , clearly indicates the nanoparticles are crystalline in nature . 
 higher resolution studies with tem analysis shows size , shape , and agglomeration pattern of nanoparticles . 
 it achieves better resolution than sem due to electron energies higher than 20 kv used in sem . 
 finally , all the microscopic studies reveal the biologically synthesized agnps are spherical in shape , having the size range from 3 to 57 nm polydispersed and no agglomerations were found between the particles . to test the inhibitory effect of biologically synthesized nanoparticles on different microorganisms 
 bacterial species show the highest inhibitory activity when compare to fungi because the cell walls of fungi are made up of chitin is more rigid when compare to bacterial cell walls containing peptidoglycans . among the bacteria , 
 gram - negative species show the highest inhibitory zones when to compare to gram - positive species , because the gram - negative species containing a less amount of peptidoglycans . 
 silver is a precious metal used as an effective antimicrobial agent before the advent of agnps . due to overuse of silver products , 
 decreased the efficiency of silver agents as antibiotic . in recent times with the advancement of nanotechnology , the interest in the use of agnps as antibacterial agents had been rekindled . 
 small sized nanoparticles have higher antimicrobial activity than larger particles because they have large surface area to interact bacteria efficiently . in recent times , the scientists produce 30 to 40 nm size , spherical shaped agnps from fruit extract of vitis vinifera shows excellent antimicrobial activity against b. subtilis and k. planticola . 10 to 70 
 nm size , spherical shaped agnps synthesized from emblica officinalis fruit extract shows potential antimicrobial activity against s. aureus , b. subtilis , e. coli , and k. pneumoniae . 
 euphorbia hirta leaf mediated synthesis of agnps having a spherical shape with 40 - 45 nm size shows good antifungal efficacy . in our studies also 3 - 57 nm size , spherical shaped agnps produced from a. digitata pulp extract confirmed by hr microscopic studies with afm , sem , and tem proved these agnps are eco - friendly antimicrobial agents against different microorganisms . 
 in the present study , we report an eco - friendly , non - toxic , cost - effective method for synthesis of agnps from a. digitata pulp extract as reducing agent . in this method , naturally occurring materials are acts as reducing agents such as bio - molecules such as phenols and proteins present in plant extract as a simple and alternative to complex physical or chemical synthetic procedures 
 . 3 to 57 nm size , spherical shaped , polydispersed nanoparticles are produced from a. digitata pulp extract confirmed by afm , sem , and tem prove this plant extract as an effective reducing agent for the production of narrow range of nanoparticles by industrial scale . 
 further antimicrobial studies reveal that small size , spherical shaped particles have immense activity against different microbial pathogens and acts as eco - friendly antimicrobial agents .","hence present study aimed synthesize agnps digitata fruit pulp extract characterize know potentiality agnps different microbial pathogens

"hardware removal is indicated for infection , nonunion , failure of fixation , pain , soft tissue irritation , and anticipated strenuous activity after fracture healing [ 14 ] . during removal cases 
 subsequent removal of broken hardware increases surgical time , and retained metalwork potentially complicates future surgeries ( figure 1 ) . 
 although there have been several articles that have discussed titanium implant failure , most have discussed this issue within the context of hardware failure during fracture healing , and not particularly during removal of hardware [ 69 ] . to our knowledge 
 , none have been specific to the elbow , which merits its own discussion due to its unique anatomy . 
 the distal humerus of the elbow is unique in that is has a high ratio of cortical to cancellous bone . 
 therefore , in this study we set out to investigate incidence of bone screw failure during hardware removal procedures and we were interested in comparing titanium and stainless steel bone screws because these are the most common types of metallic fracture implants in circulation . 
 in addition , we set out to determine whether the duration of implantation and the anatomic location of the bone screws about the elbow were associated with bone screw failure during removal procedures 
 . a better understanding of metallic hardware failure during removal procedures may help surgeons in the preoperative planning stages of these cases , in terms of surgical tool selection and staff availability . 
 after institutional review board ( irb ) approval , all cases performed by orthopaedic trauma or upper extremity surgeons between 1/1/2000 and 10/1/2009 at our level 1 trauma center were reviewed . 
 inclusion criteria were ( 1 ) deep implant removal cases , ( 2 ) hardware removed from the distal humerus or the proximal ulna , and ( 3 ) isolated elbow injuries . 
 the exclusion criteria were ( 1 ) cases that did not have relevant or inaccessible elbow x - rays , ( 2 ) single screw fragment extraction cases ( because in these cases the hardware had previously broke and was small in size , which we believe was not representative of the other screws being removed ) , ( 3 ) patients younger than 17 years , and ( 4 ) cases that were originally performed at an outside institution ( unavailable medical records ) . the factors considered were ( 1 ) whether or not the bone screws broke during removal and the type of implant metal used ( titanium alloy , ti6al4v or stainless steel ) , ( 2 ) the length of time between initial implantation and removal , where cases were divided into two groups based on a conservative estimate of the time period required for osseointegration of titanium implants [ 10 , 11 ] : one group was for cases where the duration of time between implantation and removal was less than 12 months and the second group was for cases where the duration between implantation and removal was 12 months or more ; and ( 3 ) anatomic location about the elbow ( distal humerus or proximal ulna ) . 
 the data was extracted from the medical record . due to the small sample size , fisher 's exact test was used to determine statistical differences between two sets of categorical data . 
 an independent t - test was used to compare the means of two independent groups . 
 differences that had less than 0.05 probability of occurring from chance were considered statistically significant . 
 we identified a total of 47 cases , of which 21 met the inclusion criteria . 
 we carried out an independent t - test to determine if there were any differences between the ages of patients that had broken screws and those that did not , and no statistical significance was found , p = 0.740 . 
 out of 21 cases , screws broke during removal in 5 cases ( 23.8% ) . in 16 out of 21 cases , 
 the reasons for hardware removal were infection in 7/21 cases , symptomatic , prominent hardware in 7/21 cases , nonunion in 6/21 cases , and contracture in 1/21 cases . 
 14 involved titanium alloy and 7 involved stainless steel implants . within the titanium hardware group , in 10 cases removal was uneventful , and in 4 cases , fracture of at least one screw occurred . in comparison , out of the 7 stainless steel hardware removal cases , there was one case that resulted in one or more broken screws . 
 overall , compared to stainless steel , failure of titanium alloy screws during removal was not found to be statistically significant ( p = 0.61 ) .   in order to determine whether there were any association between the duration of implantation and hardware failure during removal 
 , cases were divided into two groups : group ( 1 ) duration of hardware implantation was 12 months or less ( mean 7.7 , range two to 12 months ) , and group ( 2 ) : duration of implantation was more than 12 months ( mean 41.6 , range 16 to 74 months ) . 
 twelve cases had hardware removed within 12 months of implantation and nine cases had hardware removed after 12 months of initial implantation . 
 bone screws that were removed after 12 months of surgery were more likely to break during removal ( p = 0.046 ) . 
 when titanium screws were analyzed separately , those removed within 12 months of surgery were more likely to be removed intact as compared to those removed more than 12 months after implantation ( p = 0.003 ) . the small number of stainless steel cases ( seven ) did not warrant statistical calculations . 
 with respect to anatomic location , there were 12 distal humerus and 15 proximal ulna cases ( table 1 ) . 
 six cases involved the distal humerus only , nine cases involved the proximal ulna only , and six cases had simultaneous proximal ulna and distal humerus involvement . in one case where titanium screws broke and in one case where stainless steel screws broke , it was unclear where the location was and these cases were discarded from the analysis . in general , bone screw failure was equally likely to occur when removed from the distal humerus and the proximal ulna ( p = 0.28 ) . 
 hardware failure during removal cases is a commonly seen problem in orthopaedics   ( figure 1 ) . 
 currently , there is no single hardware removal technique that is uniformly successful , and several different methods may be employed during the same case . 
 such techniques include the use of screw extractors , trephines , extraction bolts , pliers , and various other devices . 
 the purpose of this article was to determine the incidence of bone screw failure during hardware removal procedures , and we were interested in comparing titanium and stainless steel bone screws . 
 in addition , we set out to determine whether the duration of implantation and the anatomic location of the bone screws about the elbow had any association with bone screw failure during removal procedures . 
 we believe that prior knowledge of the type of metal implanted ( mainly titanium ) and the duration of implantation to be useful information that can help in the preoperative planning of hardware removal procedures . 
 firstly , this may allow surgeons to request hardware removal kits , thus saving precious operative time . 
 second , it is our experience that hardware removal procedures are often considered not technically demanding and are often delegated to less experienced surgical staff such as junior residents who may be more likely to break the hardware . 
 therefore , we believe that experienced staff surgeons should be available during procedures where titanium is being removed . having broken hardware in the elbow may complicate future surgeries in the same region of the limb . with regards to orthopaedic implants 
 , it is known that both titanium alloy and commercially pure titanium hardware are more predisposed to in situ fracture relative to stainless steel [ 69 ] . as compared to stainless steel , 
 titanium alloy is lighter , has a lower modulus of elasticity , and has superior corrosion resistance and biocompatibility , but inferior ductility and notch sensitivity . 
 the literature search performed for this review did not reveal any previous studies that compare hardware removal from the elbow in vivo for titanium and stainless steel fracture implants . 
 in contrast to titanium implants remaining in situ for less than 12 months , we observed that the titanium implants remaining in situ for more than 12 months had a tendency to fail during extraction . in this series , it is likely that a combination of titanium alloy 's fatigue properties secondary to notch sensitivity and osseointegration were responsible for this observation . 
 the fatigue strength of titanium alloy is generally comparable to stainless steel 316l , but notch sensitivity in both commercially pure titanium and titanium alloy has been shown to significantly shorten the fatigue life of these implants in comparison to stainless steel [ 1214 ] . 
 osseointegration has been observed to occur within 310 months in titanium alloy [ 10 , 11 ] . 
 the degree of bone ingrowth and on - growth , however , continues to increase for years after initial implantation ( figure 2 ) . 
 although there have been studies showing evidence of stainless steel osseointegration , it is generally accepted that commercially pure titanium and titanium alloy are more biocompatible and more likely to osseointegrate than stainless steel . in our series , it is likely that as osseointegrataion became more complete , greater removal torques contributed to the failure of titanium alloy screws in this series . given these properties , we postulate that over longer periods and increased loading cycles , the development of micofractures and osseointegration contributed to screw breakage during implant removal . 
 secondly , the cases studied were not uniform ; there were a wide variety fractures and hardware systems involved . 
 in addition , due to the small number of cases it was necessary to include multiple surgeons . 
 in addition , not all x - rays were available for review ; therefore we were not able to account for the type of hardware , such as locking or non locking plate technology . in this study 
 , there appears to be a time - related association for bone screw failure during removal cases , and for titanium alloy in particular . 
 this is likely due to the increased bone ingrowth and the adverse effect of notch sensitivity on titanium alloy 's fatigue properties .","therefore study set investigate incidence bone screw failure hardware removal procedures interested comparing titanium stainless steel bone screws common types metallic fracture implants circulation

 screw failure during extraction was the dependent variable . 
 five of 21 patients experienced hardware failure during extraction . 
 fourteen patients had titanium alloy implants . in four cases , 
 titanium screws broke during extraction . 
 compared to stainless steel , titanium screw failure during removal was not statistically significant ( p = 0.61 ) . 
 screw removal 12 months after surgery was more likely to result in broken , retained screws in general ( p = 0.046 ) and specifically for titanium alloy ( p = 0.003 ) . 
 bone screws removed from the distal humerus or proximal ulna had an equal chance of fracturing ( p = 0.28 ) . 
 there appears to be a time - related association of titanium alloy bone screw failure during hardware removal cases from the elbow . 
 this may be explained by titanium 's properties and osseointegration ."
"a 29-year - old male develops severe pancreatitis , presumably as a result of heavy alcohol intake . 
 he is admitted to the hospital ward for management but becomes hypoxic over the first 24 hours , requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation . 
 the patient is admitted to the intensive care unit and , in the course of investigation , he has an abdominal computed tomography scan that shows an inflamed pancreas with some necrotic areas . 
 although there are no obvious signs of infection , you wonder whether antibiotics are useful in the patient 's management . 
 graham ramsay and paul breedveld antibiotic prophylaxis in necrotizing pancreatitis is attractive as 80% of all deaths from severe pancreatitis are due to infected necrosis , and the time scale for the occurrence of infection makes prophylaxis feasible . 
 early trials of antibiotic prophylaxis in pancreatitis were negative , probably due to inappropriate antibiotic choice and also due to failure to focus on necrotizing pancreatitis . with more appropriate antibiotics , however , there are now a number of published randomized clinical trials on prophylactic antibiotic use in the management of acute necrotizing pancreatitis [ 1 - 4 ] . 
 these include only randomized clinical trials that make specific mention of acute pancreatitis , of incidence of pancreatic infection , of related sepsis and mortality , and that the antibiotics used had a minimal inhibitory concentration in the pancreas . 
 all four randomized clinical trials complied with at least one of the criteria in the guidelines for assessment of the quality of reports of randomized clinical trials of jadad and colleagues . pederzoli and colleagues included 74 patients , used imipenem and found a significant ( p < 0.01 ) reduction of septic complications , such as infected pancreatic necrosis , peripancreatic abscesses or infected pseudocysts . 
 there was no significant reduction in multiorgan failure , in the need to operate or in mortality . 
 sainio and colleagues included 60 patients , used cefuroxime and found a significant reduction in the number of surgical interventions ( p = 0.012 ) and in mortality ( p = 0.028 ) . 
 there was no significant reduction in the incidence of infected pancreatic necrosis or pancreatic abscesses . 
 delcenserie and colleagues included 23 patients , used a combination of ceftazidime , amikacin and metronidazole , and found a significant reduction of septic complications ( p < 0.03 ) . 
 schwarz and colleagues included 26 patients , used a combination of ofloxacin and metronidazole , and found a better survival ( 0 versus 2 deaths ; mortality rate , 0% versus 15% ) , but no difference in the rate of infection of pancreatic necrosis . 
 pooling of the data from these 183 patients by bosscha and colleagues in a meta - analysis resulted in a group of 95 patients treated with prophylactic antibiotics and 88 patients without . 
 these pooled data showed a significant risk reduction with prophylactic antibiotic for pancreas - related infection ( -14% ; p = 0.04 ) , for sepsis ( -25% ; p = 0.0002 ) , and for death ( -13% ; p = 0.007 ) . in another meta - analysis , golub and 
 they included a study by luiten and colleagues , which used selective decontamination of the digestive tract . 
 selective decontamination is attractive as it may allow the use of prophylaxis without the risk of inducing superinfections through the use of long - term broad - spectrum antibiotics . 
 these data support our opinion that patients who develop necrosis due to acute pancreatitis benefit from prophylactic antibiotic use . 
 it significantly reduces the number of infections , reduces sepsis and reduces mortality related to acute pancreatitis . 
 lorne h blackbourne and stephen m cohn limiting prophylactic antibiotic use in severe pancreatitis minimizes the development of resistance and superinfections in vulnerable hosts , and also avoids unnecessary costs . 
 nearly three decades ago in small , prospective , randomized trials ( totaling 192 patients ) , the use of antibiotics for routine pancreatitis was shown to be of no apparent benefit [ 9 - 11 ] . at this juncture 
 there is no definitive , level one , data supporting the use of intravenous antibiotics in the treatment of patients with severe pancreatitis , even in the setting of pancreatic necrosis . 
 the few prospective studies that exist investigating antibiotic use in severe pancreatitis have been nonblinded trials with small patient populations . 
 pederzoli and colleagues , in the most often quoted trial to support the routine use of antibiotics in pancreatitis , prospectively randomized 74 patients with severe necrotizing pancreatitis in a nonblinded fashion ( secondary to either alcoholism or gallstones ) to receive imipenem - cilastin or no antibiotics . 
 they found no significant differences in organ dysfunction or mortality ( antibiotics , 29% and 7% versus no antibiotics , 39% and 12% ; p = not significant ) or mortality ( antibiotics , 7% versus no antibiotics , 12% ; p = not significant ) . 
 the frequency of operation for debridement of pancreatic necrosis was also unaffected , but pederzoli and colleagues did note that there was a decrease in the number of positive pancreatic cultures ( percutaneously and intraoperatively ) . 
 sainio and colleagues randomized 60 patients with alcoholic necrotizing pancreatitis to receive cefuroxime versus no antibiotic treatment in a nonblinded trial . 
 they reported a significant decrease in mortality in the patient group receiving antibiotics when compared with those not receiving antibiotics ( 3% versus 23% , p = 0.03 ) . 
 this study has been criticized because of its small size and because of the large percentage of patients ( 50% ) who apparently succumbed from infections caused by staphylococcus epidermidis ( which were often associated with catheter sepsis ) . 
 lutien and colleagues more recently used intravenous and enteral antibiotics ( including amphotericin ) to achieve decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract for the purpose of possibly decreasing bacterial inoculation of the necrotic pancreatic tissue via translocation . 
 they reported a nonsignificant decrease in mortality ( 22% gut decontamination versus 35% controls , p = 0.19 ) in patients undergoing the antibiotic regimen . 
 other large trials utilizing gastrointestinal decontamination in groups of critically ill patients have failed to demonstrate a decrease in mortality or intensive care days . 
 this extensive protocol , however , requires significant resource utilization and costs , and also carries a potential risk of the development of bacterial resistance . while there is inconclusive data supporting the use of prophylactic antibiotics in the setting of severe pancreatitis , 
 isenmann and colleagues have shown a significant increase in candida infections in patients with pancreatic necrosis with prolonged exposure to antibiotics . among 92 patients with infected pancreatic necrosis , 
 22 had candida infections and this subgroup had a major increase in mortality ( 64% ) compared with those patients without candida ( 19% , p < 0.01 ) . 
 certainly , critically ill patients developing superinfections tend to be those with more severe disease , with longer antibiotic courses and with longer hospital stays . 
 we need to identify the subset of patients who are most likely to benefit from prophylactic antibiotics in the setting of severe pancreatitis . 
 an adequately powered , randomized , double - blind , multicenter trial involving a suitable antibiotic regimen compared with placebo in a homogeneous group with severe pancreatitis is required . 
 the primary endpoints should be clinically relevant , such as defined organ dysfunction , length of intensive care unit stay , and 30-day and 60-day mortality . until such a study 
 is completed , we can not recommend routine prophylactic antibiotics in the setting of severe pancreatitis . 
 graham ramsay and paul breedveld we agree with blackbourne and cohn that all systemic antibiotic use carries a risk of increasing selection pressure for resistance , and that antibiotic use should be minimized where appropriate . 
 we also agree that the early trials they cite were inconclusive . as we said , 
 the discussion should focus on the relative benefit in terms of infection , morbidity and mortality against the risk of increased resistance to antimicrobials , based on the current literature . while we agree that confirmatory studies are desirable ( they are in progress ) 
 the study of luiten and colleagues on selective decontamination of the digestive tract for prophylaxis deserves special attention . 
 it suggests we can achieve the benefits of prophylaxis without the risk of increasing resistance , through the use of systemic antibiotics . 
 lorne h blackbourne and stephen m cohn "" meta - analysis is to statistical data analysis what metaphysics is to theoretical physics ! "" utilizing meta - analyses of tiny , inconclusive and , in some instances , flawed clinical trials to justify the use of a modality ( broad - spectrum antibiotics ) with known adverse impact ( microbial resistance , superinfection , drug toxicity and cost ) appears unfounded . 
 we believe that a multicenter , double - blind , prospective , randomized trial is warranted prior to the use of antibiotics in the setting of necrotizing pancreatitis . 
 we presently use antibiotics in this population only when computed tomography - guided aspiration biopsy of pancreatic necrosis reveals bacterial pathogens .","appropriate antibiotics however number published randomized clinical trials prophylactic antibiotic use management acute necrotizing pancreatitis

"we reviewed the medical records of patients who had l. monocytogenes isolated from blood and body fluids from sterile sites during 19962008 at the national taiwan university hospital ( ntuh ) , a 2,500-bed hospital in taiwan . 
 we evaluated disease severity using modified acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii scores ( 8) . 
 incidence of nontyphiodal salmonella bacteremia ( ntsb ) during 20002008 in ntuh was calculated for trend comparison of the 2 foodborne illnesses . 
 only 1 episode was calculated during the same admission for ntsb to avoid the influence of repetitive bacteremia . 
 isolates from patients with fetomaternal listeriosis ( i.e. , paired isolates from mother and neonate who had listeriosis ) were considered to be the same and only 1 of them was analyzed . 
 all isolates were analyzed for their serotype by pcr as described , and genetic relatedness was evaluated by pulsed - field gel electrophoresis ( pfge ) by using pulsenet standardized protocols and 2 restriction enzymes ( asci and apai ) ( 2,9 ) . 
 strains were considered to be of the same cluster if their bands had indistinguishable restriction patterns by both enzymes . 
 strains with pfge patterns with > 80% similarity by asci and apai profiles were considered to be closely related . 
 a forward stepwise model with a p value of 0.1 was used , and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant in the multivariate cox proportional hazards model . during the study period , 
 listeriosis was diagnosed in 48 patients , and 46 nonduplicated isolates were obtained for further microbiological analysis . 
 average annual incidence increased from 0.0287 cases per 1,000 admissions during 19962004 to 0.118 cases per 1,000 admissions during 20052008 ( figure 1 ) . 
 the increase in annual incidence of listeriosis was significantly correlated with years ( p = 0.0045 ) . 
 the average annual incidences of ntsb were 1.189 and 1.118 per 1,000 admissions during 20002004 and 20052008 , respectively ; it was not significantly correlated with years ( p = 0.50 ) . 
 age - specific incidence of listeriosis increased at both extremes of age , but especially among patients > 80 years ( figure 2 ) . 
 all of the patients with listeriosis lived in northern taiwan , and no obvious geographic correlation was observed between listeriosis patients in each year . 
 incidence ( cases per 1,000 admissions ) of human listeriosis and serotype distribution of all isolates , national taiwan university hospital , taipei , taiwan , 19962008 . 
 forty - six isolates were available for analysis , including 2 serotype 4b isolates from fetomaternal transmission in 2005 and 2006 and 1 serotype 4b from a pediatric patient ( 2005 ) . 
 patient distribution and incidence of human listeriosis , by age group , national taiwan university hospital , taipei , taiwan , 19962008 . 
 all 43 patients had underlying predisposing conditions , and 18 ( 42% ) were > 65 years of age . of the 30 patients with malignancies , 23 ( 77% ) 
 one female patient had coexisting non - hodgkin lymphoma and colon cancer ; 1 male patient had coexisting non - hodgkin lymphoma , gastric cancer , and bladder cancer . 
 initial modified acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii score , mean  sd : 18.8  7.3 . among the 46 isolates , 
 serotype 1/2b was identified most frequently ( 46% ) , followed by 1/2a ( 28% ) and 4b ( 26% ) . 
 all 46 isolates were susceptible to ampicillin , ertapenem , meropenem , and vancomycin ; 3 isolates were intermediately susceptible to trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole ; and 4 isolates were nonsusceptible to linezolid ( 10 ) . 
 sixteen ( 37% ) patients received cephalosporin alone as initial treatment regimens and empirical treatment was effective for only 14 ( 33% ) . 
 the presence of solid - organ malignancies was a significant negative prognostic factor for 14-day mortality in the univariate analysis ( 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 1.16516.694 ; p = 0.029 ) but not in the multivariate analysis . 
 the results of the multivariate analysis for 14-day mortality showed that hepatic decompensation at disease onset was a significant negative prognostic factor ( hazard ratio 12.02 , 95% ci 1.84278.470 ; p = 0.009 ) and that the use of effective antimicrobial drugs after culture results were reported was a significant positive prognostic factor ( hazard ratio 0.014 , 95% ci 0.0020.131 ; p<0.001 ) . 
 log - rank tests performed to compare the difference in survival between patient groups for the 2 variables also had the same results ( p<0.001 ) . 
 we observed an upsurge of listeriosis beginning in 2005 in ntuh . the increase might not be attributable to common - source outbreaks because no clustering was detected . 
 the annual incidence of listeriosis has been on the rise in europe since 2000 ( 2,3,11 ) . 
 the reason is not clear because the increase could not be attributed to outbreak clusters and no increase in pregnancy - related listeriosis was observed ( 2,3 ) . 
 wong et al . found that l. monocytogenes was isolated in > 50% of pork samples and chicken carcasses ( 6 ) . 
 semiready foods ( dumplings and meatballs ) and frozen dim sum examined also carried the pathogen ( 34.0% and 4.4% , respectively ) , and > 60% of the isolates were serotype 1 or 4 ( 6 ) . if served undercooked , these foods could be potential transmission sources . 
 taiwan currently has no strict regulatory policy regarding listeriosis in the food industry and no disease surveillance system . in france , 
 serotype 4b was the predominant serotype ( 42%56% ) , whereas serotype 1/2b was more common ( 46% ) in our study ( 2 ) . 
 none of the isolates were resistant to the tested agents , except for 4 isolates , which were resistant to linezolid . 
 the contributions of disease severity and antimicrobial drug treatment are difficult to evaluate in population - based studies ( 12 ) . 
 brouwer et al . reported that up to 30% of adults with l. monocytogenes meningitis did not receive initial adequate antimicrobial drug therapy , and they found no association between that variable and outcome ( 13 ) . a high proportion ( 37% ) of patients in our study 
 initial disease severity and initial adequate antimicrobial drug therapy was not associated with overall mortality . 
 we found that mortality was related to hepatic decompensation and effective antimicrobial drug therapy after culture results were reported . 
 therefore , the incidence of and risk factors for human listeriosis in taiwan could not be determined precisely , and potential outbreaks might have been overlooked . 
 the retrospective design of our study limited the possibility of identifying the potential vehicles and disease - acquiring behaviors . 
 an increase of listeriosis was noted since 2005 in our hospital , and all of the affected patients had predisposing factors that hampered their immunity . 
 dietary education and food management information should be provided to high - risk groups in taiwan . 
 food monitoring and human disease surveillance systems need to be established in taiwan to control this potentially fatal foodborne disease .","isolates patients fetomaternal listeriosis ie

"intimate partner violence ( ipv ) is an entrenched public health and social problem across both developed and developing nations . 
 behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical , sexual or psychological harm , including acts of physical aggression , sexual coercion , psychological abuse and controlling behaviours  [ 1 , page 11 ] . 
 there is a growing recognition and understanding of the potential health consequences of ipv both in relation to acute and chronic health impacts beyond the physical trauma cases seen in emergency departments of acute care hospitals and primary care settings . in the past two decades , 
 a growing body of literature has focused on associations between ipv and physical and mental health across a wide range of disciplines . 
 this is reflected in the increasing volume of research articles that deal with psychological consequences and correlates of ipv , including ptsd and other related psychological conditions .   since the adoption of the 1993 united nations general assembly resolution convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women ( cedaw ) , acceptance of ipv as a cross - cultural human rights issue affecting women across the globe has led to international agencies beginning to fund research studies [ 37 ] . 
 there is now a much broader recognition of the public health implications of ipv , taking it from a personal and family issue related to the legal and justice system to an issue that needs to be acknowledged and addressed at a societal level . 
 further , increasing evidence suggests that the impact of ipv is not exclusively concurrent with the experience of abuse and may last long after the violence has ceased . the sheer volume of literature in the ipv area , even when confined to health issues , can create confusion around identifying the most likely correlates and consequences of ipv . 
 this is further complicated by the difficulties researchers face when attempting to assess the health of this population . 
 studies are frequently confined to drawing samples of convenience ( from shelters , clinics , etc . ) and where community samples are drawn there are concerns over underreporting  all of which limit generalisability . 
 in addition , the varying ways in which ipv is assessed leads to inconsistency in outcomes across studies . the purpose of this review paper is to provide an overview of recent research literature that has examined ipv and health . the review synthesizes literature from a broad range of studies to map patterns and trends of health consequences and correlates of ipv . 
 literature searches of three major online databases ( scopus , sage premier , and proquest ) were undertaken , covering literature published during the time period of january 2006 to june 2012 . 
 this time period allowed capture of the most recent papers in the field whilst maintaining the body of reviewed literature to a manageable size . to ensure that papers using a slightly different terminology for ipv were not inadvertently excluded , the search terms used included both  domestic violence  and  intimate partner violence . 
 as this paper is concerned with the link between violence and health , the terms  physical health  and  mental health 
 searches were conducted within the title , abstract , and keyword lists of each database . 
 articles were firstly assessed on the basis of title and abstract in order to ascertain their relevance for this review . following this , 
 full - text copies of studies for possible inclusion in the review , were accessed in order to conduct a more thorough evaluation of their relevance . in determining relevant studies for this review , 
 the following inclusion criteria were used.the article reported on an original study , either from primary research or original secondary data analysis.physical and/or mental health consequences or correlates of intimate partner violence were the main foci of the research.the research focused on intimate partner violence against women , experienced at any point in adulthood , except during the antenatal or immediate postnatal period.the violence defined within the study was restricted to violence against women from a current or previous intimate partner . 
 the full text of the research article had to be available in english.the article had been published in a peer reviewed journal between january 2006 and june 2012 . 
 the article reported on an original study , either from primary research or original secondary data analysis . 
 physical and/or mental health consequences or correlates of intimate partner violence were the main foci of the research . 
 the research focused on intimate partner violence against women , experienced at any point in adulthood , except during the antenatal or immediate postnatal period . the violence defined within the study 
 the article had been published in a peer reviewed journal between january 2006 and june 2012 . 
 studies that reported on health effects of intimate partner violence for both men and women were included within this review only if the results were stratified by gender , so that the health implications of partner violence on women could be clearly identified . 
 articles focused on clinical samples were excluded where the specific clinical issues might have compromised generalisability of the results , including samples where ipv occurred during pregnancy or in the immediate postnatal period , studies that focused exclusively on women with specific health condition ( e.g. , hiv - positive women ) and women with specific exposure to additional traumatic events ( e.g. , military veterans ) . 
 studies specifically involving adolescents and high school students were also excluded , since abuse in adolescence was beyond the scope of this review , as were articles relating to health economics . 
 as illustrated in figure 1 , initial search of the various databases using specified key terms , yielded 1077 articles . 
 these articles were reviewed on the basis of their titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria specified above . 
 this phase of the review removed 866 articles , leaving 211 articles for further consideration . 
 full - text articles were accessed for each of these studies in order to carry out a more detailed review of their relevance . 
 after application of the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria , the number of articles for review was further reduced to 98 studies . 
 each of these studies was read and analysed to extract and summarise relevant findings . in this process 
 , an additional 24 papers were removed from the review and one paper was added . 
 upon completion of the review selection process , there were 75 studies which form the basis for the findings presented in this review . 
 setting of reviewed studies and ipv prevalence 
  the study settings for reviewed articles are summarised in table 1 . 
 just over 30% of the studies utilized a population - based sample and about 19% of the studies collected data from domestic violence shelters . 
 studies based in medical settings were represented by primary healthcare ( 13.3% ) , mental health settings ( 6.7% ) , emergency departments ( 5.3% ) , and health maintenance organizations ( 2.7% ) . the lifetime prevalence of intimate partner violence reported in the studies varied widely , as indicated in table 1 . in population studies , 
 prevalence ranged from 0.98%   to 70.9% , whereas in community samples the range was from 11.4%   to 44% . 
 the highest reported incidence ( 78.8% ) was from a sample of undergraduate university students   reporting on dating violence . 
 studies that recruited women from domestic violence shelters , or crisis centres for women who had experienced ipv , were reported as a prevalence of 100% as were studies that recruited women who were pursuing protection orders against abusive partners through the court system . 
 of the 75 reviewed papers , 55 reported on studies conducted in developed countries and the remaining 20 studies reported on findings from developing countries . 
 the vast majority of studies ( n = 70 ) were quantitative in nature , three studies used qualitative methodology and reporting and two studies used a combination of qualitative and quantitative techniques . 
 the majority of studies reported findings around the mental health implications of intimate partner violence . of the 75 studies reviewed , 38 ( 50% ) dealt exclusively with mental health issues , 24 studies ( 32% ) reported on both mental and physical health outcomes , 9 studies ( 13% ) reported on physical health outcomes only , and 4 studies ( 5% ) reported exclusively on sleep problems . in this section , 
 we describe our synthesis of findings sequentially , beginning with mental health outcomes , including depression , ptsd , anxiety , suicidality and self - harm , self - perceived mental health and psychological distress , and impact of intimate partner violence on quality of sleep and sleep disorders . 
 the second section of the review covers findings of intimate partner violence on physical health outcomes including functional health , self - perceived physical health impact , and chronic health conditions .   from the articles included within the review , 66 studies reported on aspects of mental health in relation to intimate partner violence . 
 depression was the most commonly researched aspect of mental health in relation to intimate partner violence , being reported on in 42 of the reviewed articles [ 10 , 1353 ] . 
 the high relative importance of depression in its impact on health , as a result of ipv , is shown by the burden of disease figures given in the study by vos et al .   who found that 34.7% of the total ipv disease burden was attributable to depression . 
 this is in comparison to 27.3% attributable to anxiety , 10.7% to suicide , and only 0.6% of the burden of disease attributed to physical injuries as a result of ipv . 
 reported that the incidence of major depression during the past 12 months was 51.4% from their sample of women 's shelter residents . 
 this compared to the national average for the general us female population of just 2.4% reporting depression in the previous 12 months . 
 of all the studies that investigated the link between depression and ipv history , only one study , conducted in 2008 by fedovskiy et al . 
 this study of american latino women ( n = 105 ) from a primary care clinical setting found that women endorsing a history of ipv had a higher odds ratio of having a major depressive disorder ( or 1.68 ) compared to women with no history of ipv that was not statistically significant ( p = 0.22 ) . 
 note that their nonsignificant finding is contrary to the findings of previous studies and postulate that the high baseline levels of depressive disorder in their study sample could be a potential confounder that masks any significant effects . 
 all the remaining reviewed studies consistently reported significant associations between a history of ipv and depressive symptoms . 
 several studies indicated that severity or chronicity of violence was associated with more severe depressive symptoms [ 13 , 14 , 16 , 17 , 40 , 50 ] . 
 .   indicated that subjective appraisals of the  stressfulness  of an ipv event may have a stronger impact on women 's depressive symptoms than more 
 many studies reported on ipv as a single overarching construct ; however , other studies broke down their findings to report on individual categories of violence , most commonly : physical , sexual , and psychological / emotional abuse . experiencing more than one type of abuse increased the probability of having depressive symptoms as well as the severity of those symptoms [ 19 , 21 , 27 , 37 ] . 
 the results reported in the majority of studies indicated that women usually reported more than one type of violence in their history of abuse . of those studies reporting on depression that did present findings on distinct abuse categories , pico - alfonso et al 
 .   found psychological ipv to be as detrimental as physical ipv in terms of depressive symptoms in their study sample of spanish women . 
 wong et al .   found psychological abuse to be the significant predictor of higher levels of ipv - related depression in their study of chinese women . in this study , it was found that the more frequent the psychological abuse , the higher the level of depression experienced , but this significant result was not found to be present in relation to the frequency of physical abuse . 
 the results reported by chen et al . , in their us - based study of hispanic women , indicated that women who had experienced sexual abuse from their intimate partner were at far higher odds ( or 42.60 , 95% ci : 2.39758.61 ) of developing depression than women with either a history of physical ( or 10.28 , 95% ci : 1.5468.77 ) or psychological abuse ( or 5.83 , 95% ci : 2.1116.16 ) when compared with nonabused women . 
 the wide fluctuations of the 95% ci for sexual abuse and physical abuse are due to the very small number of respondents in each category , indicating that these results should be viewed with caution .    the us - based study by zlotnick et al .   reported on patterns of recovery in mental health status in women with a history of ipv followed across a five - year timeframe . 
 they concluded that women reporting ipv at the commencement of their study were still significantly more likely to experience a greater degree of depressive symptoms and functional impairment with lower self - esteem and life satisfaction at the 5-year followup , compared to women without ipv . 
 they did not find any evidence to suggest that women remaining in an abusive relationship were worse off , in terms of psychosocial difficulties , than women who left those relationships . 
 thus , they concluded that women who have experienced ipv are at risk of a range of long - term mental health concerns , irrespective of whether or not they stay or leave the abusive relationship .   within this review , 
 14 studies related to the incidence of posttraumatic stress disorder ( ptsd ) in abused women [ 15 , 18 , 21 , 23 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 32 , 33 , 36 , 37 , 5456 ] . 
 all studies agreed on the fact that a history of intimate partner violence was positively associated with the increased incidence of ptsd symptoms and ptsd diagnoses . 
 estimated that women with a history of ipv were 2.3 times more likely to develop ptsd compared to never - abused women after controlling for race , marital status , and income . 
 two other studies [ 23 , 33 ] reported that women with ipv histories had approximately three times the odds of meeting criteria for ptsd as compared to women who did not report a history of ipv . within the reviewed studies , the reported prevalence rates of ptsd varied widely . 
 chandra et al .   reported , in their indian study involving female psychiatric outpatients , that of all the women reporting ipv , 14% met the criteria for ptsd . 
 the rate of ptsd reported from a sample of women from domestic violence shelters in usa was reported as 16.2% by helfrich et al . . 
 yet , in a similar sample of abused women from crisis shelters and the general community in usa , sampled by woods et al . , the rate of women who met the criteria for clinical diagnosis of ptsd was much higher at 92.4% . 
 another us study of women from a health maintenance organisation ( hmo ) found that 30.9% of women with a history of ipv had symptoms consistent with ptsd , compared with 13.7% of women who did not have a history of ipv . 
 similar to the trend for depression , it was reported that women experiencing more severe and more sustained abuse generally exhibited higher levels of ptsd symptoms [ 18 , 27 , 56 ] . also , the experience of more than one form of abuse led to greater levels of ptsd symptomology [ 21 , 27 ] . 
 reported that the relative risk of experiencing ptsd symptoms rose with the number of abuse types experienced . 
 women who had experienced three types of abuse were more than nine times as likely to develop ptsd as a woman who had no history of abuse . 
 a woman experiencing only one type of abuse was just over two times as likely to develop ptsd compared to a nonabused woman . 
 pico - alfonso et al .   stated that , in their study , the occurrence of ptsd alone was rare , with most women exhibiting comorbidity of ptsd along with depressive symptoms . 
 this appears to be the case in several other ptsd studies as well [ 15 , 18 , 23 , 36 ] . 
 this link between ptsd symptoms and depressive symptoms is noted by fedovskiy et al .   who report that women with ptsd were ten times more likely to also have high depression scores ( ces - d scores of > 15 ) and they suggest that ptsd and major depressive disorder comorbidity in their study may be a result of symptom overlap , especially the symptoms of anhedonia , sleep disturbance , and concentration difficulties . 
 , anxiety was investigated as a part of sixteen studies [ 1315 , 20 , 22 , 25 , 28 , 31 , 37 , 39 , 40 , 43 , 46 , 50 , 51 , 53 ] , but it was not the exclusive focus of any of these studies , usually being reported along with other common mental disorders , most often depression . in the study on burden of disease associated with ipv , 
 vos et al .   found that 27.3% of the total ipv burden of disease was attributable to anxiety , making it the second highest contributing factor , with only depression having a higher percentage score . in their us - based study of women from a domestic violence shelter , helfrich et al . 
 reported that 77% of women from the shelter sample reported anxiety during the previous 12 months , compared to a reported national average of 6.1% for females from a national health survey . 
 all sixteen reviewed studies on anxiety reported finding a positive association between a history of intimate partner violence and increased levels of anxiety in women . 
 this relationship existed even after demographic variables such as age , education , and income were taken into account [ 22 , 40 , 43 ] . 
 pico - alfonso et al .   reported a link between severity of anxiety symptoms and comorbidity with depression , observing that the severity of state anxiety was higher in abused women with depressive symptoms . 
 there was also a dose - response trend apparent , with a greater severity of anxiety symptoms being present in abused women when the abuse experienced was more frequent , more intense , or more severe [ 13 , 40 , 50 ] . from the reviewed articles , six studies reported on suicide attempts [ 9 , 26 , 39 , 43 , 45 , 57 ] and twelve studies on suicidal ideation or thoughts [ 21 , 26 , 28 , 37 , 43 , 45 , 47 , 48 , 5760 ] in relation to a history of intimate partner violence . 
 all of these studies reported an association between the lifetime experience of abuse and increased suicidal ideation and suicide attempts in women . 
 results from the multi - country study by the world health organisation on women 's health and domestic violence relating to suicide were presented in three separate reports [ 9 , 57 , 58 ] . 
 the paper by devries et al .   dealt specifically with suicide attempts and reported that the experience of ipv was significantly associated with suicide attempts in every one of their thirteen study sites across nine different countries . 
 ellsberg et al .   reported that the pooled analysis , across all of their fifteen sites in ten countries , showed that women who had experienced physical or sexual violence , or both , were three times more likely to have thought about ending their lives and almost four times more likely to have attempted on one or more occasions to have ended their lives , when compared to women who had never experienced partner violence . 
 the reported adjusted odds ratios from a study of south asian immigrant women resident in the us were even higher , with abused women being seven times more likely to exhibit suicidal ideation than nonabused women from this study sample . 
 in their study of urban indian women , vachher and sharma   reported that 22.3% of the study subjects had ever thought of suicide , 12.0% reported suicidal thoughts in the past month , and 3.4% of the women had tried to commit suicide . 
 suicidal tendencies were considerably more common in women with a history of partner violence , compared to those who had not experienced violence , and these differences were statistically highly significant . 
 the effects of different types of violence in relation to suicidal ideation were reported by ishida et al .   from a population - based study of women from paraguay . 
 they found that , for abuse in the past 12 months , physical and sexual violence were more important risk factors for suicidal ideation than emotional abuse . for abuse experienced more than 12 months ago , 
 sexual violence had the largest adverse effect , indicating that sexual abuse had a longer lasting negative effect than either of the other two forms of abuse . 
 this is in contrast to the results from bangladesh , reported by naved and akhtar , who found that sexual violence by a husband was not associated with suicidal ideation in either rural or urban study sites . 
 they found emotional violence and severe physical violence to be the major determinants of suicidal ideation amongst their sample of bangladeshi women . 
 the authors also observed a dose - response effect in suicidal ideation in women exposed to a number of forms of violence . 
 women exposed to no violence , or a single form of violence , had the lowest reporting of suicidal ideation during the previous 4 weeks . 
 an increase in the number of forms of violence , experienced by women in the study , led to an increase in the rate of suicidal ideation reported during the reference period . 
 self - harm was the subject of two reviewed articles [ 61 , 62 ] . 
 sansone et al .   found that a history of domestic violence was a statistically significant predictor of bodily self - harm in their study of psychiatric inpatients in the usa . 
 a qualitative study of self - harm in victims of intimate partner violence in china   revealed that victims considered self - harm to be a method for airing painful emotions caused by abuse , or a last resort to escape by dying when they saw no other option and were no longer able to endure the violence . 
 the general categories of self - perceived mental health and psychological distress were utilized in nineteen studies . 
 these studies used a range of measurement instruments to report on generalized mental health status and functioning . the medical outcomes 
 study 36-item short form health survey ( sf-36 ) mental health component score was used in five studies [ 16 , 19 , 31 , 63 , 64 ] and the shorter sf-12 form in two other studies [ 65 , 66 ] . 
 other tools used to measure self - reported mental health status were the who developed self - reporting questionnaire ( srq-20 ) used in three studies [ 45 , 57 , 60 ] , the 12-item general health questionnaire ( ghq-12 ) used in three studies [ 8 , 12 , 67 ] and a development of author 's own questions [ 13 , 38 ] or the use of a range of questions extracted from several survey instruments . 
 a consistent finding of all these studies is that women who had experienced ipv ( physical , sexual , or psychological ) had lower mental health and social functioning scores than women who had not experienced ipv . 
 .   reported on data from a us population - based survey using the kessler-6 ( k6 ) instrument to measure the degree of serious psychological distress ( spd ) experienced in the last thirty days . 
 the risk of spd was highest among women who reported experiencing both physical and sexual ipv during their lifetime , the prevalence of spd for this group of women was 15.4% . among women with no lifetime history of ipv , 
 the prevalence of serious psychological distress was 2.1% . in a canadian study on ipv in young couples , fortin et al . 
 it was found for women in the study that a history of psychological violence gave a significant prediction of distress ; however , there was no significant prediction of distress in women experiencing physical abuse . 
 it should be noted , however , that the reported prevalence rate of psychological abuse for women in this study ( 80% ) was much higher than the reported rate for physical violence ( 27% ) .   amongst the reviewed articles , 
 four studies [ 11 , 7072 ] focused solely on sleep disturbance as a consequence of intimate partner violence and several others [ 13 , 39 , 41 , 50 ] reported on insomnia and other sleep disturbances in the context of broader physical or mental health outcomes . 
 all of the sleep studies support the finding that intimate partner violence has the capacity to impact negatively on both the quality and quantity of sleep in women with experience of ipv . 
 the main mediating pathways between intimate partner violence and poor sleep were reported as depression [ 11 , 70 ] and ptsd . 
 a qualitative study , reporting on a british focus groups of survivors of partner abuse , highlights the dangers of living with a perpetrator of violence and the impacts that this had on their sleep habits . the women stated that being asleep while the perpetrator was awake was seen as extremely risky . for some male perpetrators , 
 their female partner being asleep was sufficient reason for violence , and for others enforcing sleep deprivation was another method of control . living with 
 a constant anticipation of violence meant that these women felt that they needed to remain vigilant at all times . 
 this could continue long after separation from their violent partner , in some cases 5 or 6 years earlier . as well as disturbed and little sleep , women from the focus group reported problems of aching limbs or teeth grinding , which they related to  sleeping tightly  following the abuse . 
 there were also recurrent bad dreams , including hearing or seeing their ex - partner . 
 most of the women reported that they had spent considerable periods of time with the quality and quantity of their sleep restricted , and they felt the impact on their health and wellbeing had been significant . 
 the authors concede that it is difficult to make direct links between the women 's lack of sleep and physical problems , but the women all felt that their lack of sleep had led to a range of physical health problems . 
 symptoms reported included being  run down  ; aching all over ; having migraines and/or headaches , raised blood pressure , chronic fatigue and digestive problems ; being more susceptible to other illnesses , such as flu . 
 sleep deprivation was also reported to dramatically reduce the women 's  ability to cope  with the violence they were experiencing .   for the purpose of this review , 
 a study was considered to report functional physical health if it reported on measures of physical functioning and role limitation from the medical outcomes study 36-item short form health survey ( sf-36 ) [ 16 , 19 , 63 , 64 ] or the shorter 12-item version ( sf-12 ) [ 65 , 66 , 73 ] measures , the patient health questionnaire tool ( phq-15 ) tool   or studies that incorporated their own questions relating to physical health function , injury and illness disability , and difficulty walking or in performing daily activities [ 57 , 60 ] . 
 all of the above - mentioned scales are validated tools for measuring physical health . for all but two of the reviewed studies , women with a history of ipv had significantly lower levels of physical functioning than either nonabused women within the same study , or the female national norm value for health function scores . 
 two studies did not report an association between ipv and functional physical health . in the first , results from a us study by chen et al 
 .   still showed this trend ; however , the differences were not statistically significant . 
 the second study , by helfrich et al .   reported that there were no significant differences between their study sample of women from a domestic violence shelter and national norm data on physical symptoms or the effects of those symptoms on function . 
 detailed data on the physical function of their sample of abused women was not provided in the reviewed article . 
 recovery of physical health function after leaving an abusive partner was the subject of one review study . in this norwegian study , 
 when women were resurveyed 12 months after leaving an abusive partner , it was found that all the sf-36 quality of life domains relating to physical health of the abused women were still significantly lower than the norwegian female national population of the same age . 
 this suggests that physical functioning levels of abused women are still significantly affected , even after 12 months away from their abusive partners . 
 self - perceived physical health status , as reported by participants , was included as a health indicator in eight of the reviewed studies . 
 self - perceived poor health status was significantly associated with intimate partner violence in seven of these studies [ 17 , 26 , 33 , 38 , 60 , 66 , 67 ] . as well as physical abuse , nonphysical forms of violence in the form of emotional [ 
 60 , 67 ] and psychological [ 38 , 66 ] abuse were also implicated with lowered levels of perceived physical health . the only study reporting no significant association between the presence of partner violence and lowered levels of reported physical health was chen et al . 
 , as mentioned previously . a history of ipv has been frequently reported to be associated with a range of chronic health conditions . 
 of the studies included in this review , seventeen studies included consideration of what have been categorized as chronic conditions . these studies and 
 chronic pain was reported as being significantly associated with a history of ipv in nine reviewed studies [ 8 , 33 , 34 , 41 , 47 , 53 , 56 , 74 , 75 ] and investigated , but reported as nonsignificant in four additional studies [ 19 , 26 , 60 , 76 ] . 
 .   reported that pain had one of the highest associations with ipv of all the studied physical symptoms . in a canadian study of wuest et al . 
 , 35% of the surveyed women reported experiencing high levels of disabling pain even though they had been separated from abusive partners for an average of 20 months . 
 this was significantly higher than the reported canadian national level of 18% of women reporting debilitating pain . on average , women from the study reported experiencing pain in more than three sites and the authors particularly noted the high prevalence of women ( 43.2% ) reporting swollen and painful joints . 
 other studies have reported pain as an ongoing health problem for women with a history of ipv , experienced as chronic back ache [ 8 , 56 ] , neck pain , stomach cramps [ 41 , 56 ] , and chronic headache . 
 the use of pain medication by women with a history of ipv has been reported by several studies [ 17 , 53 , 60 ] . with significantly higher rates of 
 reported chronic pain amongst ipv survivors , it would be expected that the use of analgesics would also be significantly higher amongst these women . however , 
 this was not the case observed in two of the three reviewed studies that dealt specifically with pain medication . 
 .   found no association between ipv and the use of pain medication , but this study also reported no significant increase in the level of pain reported by the abused women in their japanese population - based sample that was part of the who multi - country study . 
 this finding is contrary to the previously mentioned study of wuest et al .   which found significantly higher pain levels in their community based study sample . 
 wuest et al . , in an allied study on medication use , reported that even though this sample of abused women reported high levels of back pain , headaches , and swollen painful joints , they were less likely to be taking over - the - counter nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) and analgesics , and no more likely to be taking opioids than canadian women in general , even though the incidence of chronic pain was significantly higher . 
 other chronic health problems that have been associated with the experience of partner violence include cardiovascular and/or circulatory problems ( including heart attack , heart disease , hypertension , thrombosis , and stroke ) [ 8 , 43 , 67 , 74 , 77 ] ; fatigue , allergies and hearing and sight problems ; respiratory problems ( including asthma , emphysema , and bronchitis ) [ 42 , 74 , 77 ] ; bone and muscle conditions ( including osteoporosis , arthritis , and other joint problems ) [ 53 , 56 , 74 , 75 ] ; diabetes [ 67 , 74 , 77 ] ; low iron [ 74 , 78 ] ; malnutrition and low weight   and gastrointestinal conditions [ 26 , 56 , 74 ] . 
 somatoform disorders and psychosomatic complaints were reported in four studies [ 14 , 33 , 40 , 41 ] . 
 scheffer lingren and renck report that the women interviewed in their swedish study suffered various physical symptoms as a result of psychological abuse , including weight loss , weight gain , stomach pain , and pains in  every bone of my body  . 
 avdibegovi and sinanovi   also reported a higher incidence of symptoms of somatization among women victims of all categories of ipv in bosnia and herzegovina . in a norwegian study , 
 nerien and schei   reported that psychosomatic complaints were more common among women reporting partner violence , with 28% of abused women reporting these complaints compared to 14% of nonabused women . 
 the complaints reported included stomach pain , headache , dizziness , and muscular pain . 
 gynaecological symptoms were reported to be associated with a history of intimate partner violence by women in studies from both developing nations [ 57 , 79 ] and developed countries [ 33 , 56 , 73 , 74 ] . a study by stephenson et al .   found that gynaecological symptoms were significantly related to the reporting of sexual violence , the most common symptom being bleeding after sexual intercourse during times other than menstruation , followed by abnormal vaginal discharge , pain or burning during urination , and pain during intercourse . 
 the incidence of abnormal pap smear results and higher rates of cervical cancer have also been positively associated with a history of ipv [ 46 , 74 ] , as has the occurrence of sexually transmissible infections ( other than hiv / aids ) [ 43 , 46 , 80 ] . among the reviewed articles , three studies dealt specifically with the association of intimate partner abuse with hiv / aids [ 8082 ] . in the population - based rwandan study conducted by dude , it was found that women who experienced any type of ipv were more likely to report non - hiv stis , but women who had specifically experienced sexual and emotional abuse were more likely to test positive for hiv compared to nonabused women . 
 conducted a two - year study to follow the incidence of new cases of hiv infection among rural south african women . 
 there were a statistically significant higher number of hiv cases reported by women with a history of partner violence ( physical or sexual ipv ) compared to nonabused women . 
 this was the case both at baseline and also for the newly acquired cases of hiv observed throughout the study period . 
 the hiv risk associated with being in a violent intimate relationship was investigated by josephs and abel   in a community - based sample of african - american women . 
 they reported that , in their study sample , there was a high correlation between the frequency of physical abuse and sexual coercion . 
 they also showed that violence perpetrated against women by their intimate partners impacted negatively on the women 's sexual decision - making and free choice , including the ability to negotiate condom use . 
 the who multi - country study on women 's health and domestic violence against women is a broad ranging study of the prevalence and health impact of ipv , commissioned by the who in 1997 . 
 it involved the collection of data from over 24,000 women at fifteen sites in ten countries : bangladesh , brazil , ethiopia , japan , namibia , peru , samoa , serbia and montenegro , thailand , and the united republic of tanzania . 
 memory loss , problems with concentration , and dizziness were screened for in the world health organization questionnaires . 
 memory loss and problems with concentration were significantly associated with lifetime experiences of partner violence across all study sites in the who multi - country study   as well as in japan   and vietnam . 
 dizziness was also reported as a condition associated with ipv history across several individual studies [ 33 , 56 , 57 ] along with reported neurological complaints . 
 this review has added to current literature by identifying those areas of health most consistently related to experiences of ipv across a wide range of samples , cultures , and ages . by systematically identifying relevant articles and synthesizing the results , it is possible to see that women who have lived with violent partners are more likely than other women to experience a range of psychological and physical symptoms and illnesses , particularly depression , ptsd , anxiety , suicidal ideation , self - harm , insomnia , pain , respiratory conditions , musculoskeletal conditions , cardiovascular disorders , diabetes , and gastrointestinal symptoms . 
 in addition , generally speaking , the more severe and/or the more frequent the experience of ipv , the more severe the symptomatology appears to be , suggesting a dose - response relationship between ipv and depression , ptsd , anxiety , and suicidal ideation . 
 the inclusion of papers from a range of settings has allowed a broad picture of health outcomes and ipv prevalence to be drawn . 
 clinical settings , by the nature of the participants , can be expected to report elevated rates of health problems , but the fact that extensive health problems were also consistently reported from a wide range of community and population - based studies attests to the generalisability of results . 
 studies conducted in health care settings also tended to report higher prevalence rates of ipv than population - based samples . 
 however , many population - based studies had rates of ipv equivalent to or higher than any of the clinical samples , especially those reported from some developing countries within the who studies . 
 the scope of papers included within the review could , thus , be seen to reflect a wide range of contexts for ipv , thus portraying a picture of ipv that expands beyond the possible biases of individual study contexts . despite the differences in the ways that ipv and health issues were measured and the inclusion of papers that utilised population , shelter and clinical samples from a wide range of cultures , the consistency of findings gives credence to the position that ipv represents a major health and human rights issue . the findings from multi - country studies using standardized questionnaires , as in the two rounds of the who multi - country studies as well as standardized modules in the demographic and health surveys ( dhs ) by many national governments in asia , africa , and south america provide similar findings [ 4 , 5 ] . in almost every country in the world , violence against women is considered a legal crime , yet women may be subject to ipv for many years . 
 there are many reasons why women might remain in violent relationships , including fear , lack of access to legal recourse , lack of resources , cultural norms , and proscription among many others . 
 this review supports the notion that ending violence might lead to increased health and wellbeing , at least for measured scales of vitality and physical function ; however , even with this improvement , women with a history of abuse still reported health levels below the national average . 
 however , health deficits related to ipv were also found to last for many years , particularly for psychological conditions such as anxiety , depression , ptsd , and sleep disorders . for other health issues , 
 whilst there are methodological limitations in inferring causality from cross - sectional data , the literature on association of ipv and poor health now includes a range of methodological enquiries including longitudinal studies . 
 the presence of a number of longitudinal studies within this review lends a broader perspective to the issue of ipv across the lifespan and helps strengthen confidence in the applicability of findings from cross - sectional studies . 
 longitudinal studies have indicated similar trends in health outcomes to those found in cross - sectional studies , and this concurrence in findings across methods is striking and provides considerable evidence to support the thesis that a history of ipv precedes poor mental health outcomes that may persist even after the violence has ended . in the current review , 
 eight studies were longitudinal and these allowed for temporal pathways to be shown between ipv and somatic symptoms , poor sleep patterns , hiv infection , and aspects of mental health including depression , anxiety , and ptsd . 
 less is known about other conditions and this demonstrates a serious gap in the literature . 
 similarly , results for poor physical health outcomes were consistent across methods . in almost all of the available studies , women 's functional health status was poorer and chronic health problems more prevalent compared with other women . 
 these findings point to chronic physical disease mediated through high levels of stress , reduced practice of healthy behaviours , and limited agency in deciding on lifestyle choices . 
 the reported findings from the included qualitative research adds a richness and a personal perspective to the understanding of the experiences of women who have had to live with intimate partner violence . 
 firstly , there is a known bias towards publication of papers that show significant results rather than those that support the null hypothesis . 
 the current review relied upon published papers , so the degree of contrary evidence , where perhaps results did not show associations between ipv and health is not known . however , the consistency within studies that measured more than one facet of health and the consistency in findings between studies offers strong evidence supporting associations between ipv and poorer health . 
 causal implications can not be made from any of the studies examined , although some temporal associations have been found . 
 again , the review offers a weight of evidence that points to a large population of women who are experiencing poorer health associated with and consequential to ipv . 
 this review utilized three large electronic databases to search for relevant articles for inclusion ; however , it is acknowledged that other relevant papers , particularly  grey literature ,  may have been missed in this search process . 
 the limiting of the review to english - language - based articles may also have excluded some pertinent papers , especially publications from developing countries which may be more likely to be published in local languages and languages other than english , this is recognized as a limitation to the review process . 
 the findings of studies included in the present review show that women with a history of ipv experience significantly poorer health including depression , anxiety , ptsd , and reduced measures in both functional and somatic physical health domains . 
 the review also highlighted the need for more methodological clarity in future studies on a number of issues . 
 these include availability of more data on the long - term mental and physical health consequences following ipv through longitudinal studies using standardised definitions and validated scales . 
 there is also a need to better understand the long - term implications of ( a ) different forms of ipv , ( b ) the cumulative impact of experiencing multiple types of ipv , and ( c ) cumulative intensity / severity of ipv . 
 the availability of high - quality cross - cultural qualitative research studies on women 's subjective experiences is also of value to allow better triangulation of the data on ipv and adverse health impacts . 
 future studies also need to focus on the pathways to recovery from abusive experiences and how health services , particularly primary care clinicians , can play a role in this rehabilitative journey . despite these gaps in current knowledge , 
 it is clear that ipv has serious and long lasting detrimental consequences for women 's health and wellbeing . 
 the accumulated findings of the papers within this review underscore the classification of ipv as a public health problem as well as a legal and social issue .","determining relevant studies review following inclusion criteria usedthe article reported original study either primary research original secondary data analysisphysical andor mental health consequences correlates intimate partner violence main foci researchthe research focused intimate partner violence women experienced point adulthood except antenatal immediate postnatal periodthe violence defined within study restricted violence women current previous intimate partner

 this paper presents a review of the literature on this topic . 
 the 75 papers included in this review cover both original research studies and those which undertook secondary analyses of primary data sources . 
 the reviewed research papers published from 2006 to 2012 include quantitative and qualitative studies from western and developing countries . 
 the results show that while there is variation in prevalence of ipv across various cultural settings , ipv was associated with a range of mental health issues including depression , ptsd , anxiety , self - harm , and sleep disorders . in most studies , these effects were observed using validated measurement tools . 
 ipv was also found to be associated with poor physical health including poor functional health , somatic disorders , chronic disorders and chronic pain , gynaecological problems , and increased risk of stis . 
 an increased risk of hiv was reported to be associated with a history of sexual abuse and violence . 
 the implications of the study findings in relation to methodological issues , clinical significance , and future research direction are discussed ."
"the development of simple creatinine - based equations to estimate kidney function has contributed to raise the epidemics of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) to the category of major public health problem . 
 ckd is an important contributor to the burden of non - communicable diseases , leading to poor quality of life and severely reduced life expectancy . 
 ckd also has a substantial impact on societal costs , by increasing per se the need for healthcare services   and contributing to work disability . 
 further , the consequences of ckd are of importance for many other aspects of healthcare , including the incidence of other comorbidities [ 1 , 5 ] or impairment on the diagnostic accuracy of laboratorial analyses and medical devices [ 68 ] dependent on protein or fluid retention by the failing kidneys . notwithstanding 
 that creatinine is a very common and low - cost assessment in healthcare [ 9 , 10 ] , systematic screening programs are lacking and , in most societies , the awareness of ckd among both physicians and patients remains very low [ 11 , 12 ] . 
 many drugs have nephrotoxic effects per se or by forcing hydrophilic drug hyperfiltration in damaged kidneys . 
 further , significant morbidity is experienced due to medication accumulation and exposure in ckd , commonly leading to adverse events , prolonged length of hospital stay , increased healthcare cost and even death [ 14 , 15 ] , even when drug clearance is mediated by non - renal mechanisms . 
 drug - induced nephrotoxicity indeed accounts for 25% of episodes of acute kidney injury , a figure that can be as high as 70% among the elderly . 
 due to low ckd awareness , the risk for inappropriate drug utilization ( idu ) in the community is high [ 13 , 15 , 1921 ] , representing a likely important risk factor for ckd progression and complications [ 22 , 23 ] . 
 sweden is a northern european country with universal healthcare access and a population of 9.8 million inhabitants as of 2015 , with nearly 25% living in the county of stockholm . 
 the burden of ckd in sweden , especially of earlier ckd stages , and its impact on society and healthcare utilization is currently unknown . 
 awareness of the extent of the problem is needed to estimate and plan for allocation of resources on disease prevention strategies as well as diagnosis and early management . 
 assessment of plasma creatinine is one of the most common routine laboratory analyses performed on wide indications in clinical practice , both in the emergency setting and in regular check - ups of patients with various disorders . 
 the extent of this occasional creatinine testing is unknown , but can provide important information on kidney function in order to inform patients and guide clinical practice . 
 the stockholm creatinine measurement ( scream ) project is a collaborative project between karolinska institutet and the stockholm county council ( sll by swedish acronym ) , to ascertain the burden of ckd and the extent of idu in the region . 
 this article provides an overview of the scream objectives and goals , details of the laboratory data extraction and linked data sources . 
 scream objectives are focussed around key research methodologies : clinical epidemiology , health services research , pharmacoepidemiology and health economics . 
 the following four specific aims were initially identified : 
 to determine the prevalence of ckd in the region of stockholm , sweden , and ascertain its clinical consequences in terms of comorbid complications and healthcare resource utilization.to determine healthcare- and socioeconomic - related risk factors for progression of ckd.to identify idu in the context of kidney dysfunction ( incorrectly dosed or nephrotoxic drug prescription ) and to document its adverse clinical consequences.to establish the safety and effectiveness of common drugs in individuals with ckd . to determine the prevalence of ckd in the region of stockholm , sweden , and ascertain its clinical consequences in terms of comorbid complications and healthcare resource utilization . to determine healthcare- and socioeconomic - related risk factors for progression of ckd . to identify idu in the context of kidney dysfunction ( incorrectly dosed or nephrotoxic drug prescription ) and to document its adverse clinical consequences . to establish the safety and effectiveness of common drugs in individuals with ckd . 
 three laboratory companies ( aleris , unilabs and karolinska ) performed the vast majority of all clinical chemistry laboratory tests of the region . 
 each laboratory provider extracted the requested laboratory tests for all patients who had these measurements undertaken throughout the region . 
 the inclusion criteria considered to enter scream was to be a stockholm resident with a valid personal identifying number undertaking at least one measurement of creatinine in primary , secondary or tertiary care during 200611 . 
 all creatinine tests analysed during the period were included , as well as other laboratory measurements routinely linked to ckd and used to guide ongoing patient assessment , monitor disease progression and identify relevant outcomes ( table 1 ) .

 creatinines analysed locally ( on site ) were largely included , as most analysing machines were connected to the laboratory data system . 
 inter- as well as intra - laboratory variation was considered minimal , with the three laboratories being frequently audited for quality and harmonization by the national organization equalis ( www.equalis.se ) . 
 however , in the absence of patient data such as height and weight , estimation of kidney function by established equations becomes less accurate for individuals below 18 years of age , and we did not consider them in our analyses . 
 patient - identified laboratory data were sent from each laboratory provider to sll 's subcontracted company tieto sweden ab ( http://www.tieto.se/ ) . 
 the personal identifier was used to link the laboratory data to the administrative health data register of this region ( vrdanalysdatabasen , val ; stockholm regional healthcare data warehouse ) ( figure 1 ) . 
 val is established by sll and contains information on all consultations in primary and secondary care ( defined as specialist outpatient care ) , as well as hospitalizations . 
 both public and private healthcare providers within the region report each patient visit to val . 
 data for primary care was available since 2003 , and for secondary care and hospitalization since 1993 . 
 each healthcare visit was accompanied by the date ( and when applicable discharge date ) , the centre accessed and medical department , therapeutic procedures undertaken and established diagnoses according to the international classification of diseases version 10 ( icd-10 ) coding system . 
 identification of the type of healthcare visit in which the laboratory test was performed is important to differentiate test results obtained during a hospitalization ( potentially influenced by acute illness ) from those performed in the out - patient setting , which may better reflect stable medical conditions . 
 comorbid history will be primarily defined based on the disease domains of the charlson comorbidity score [ 26 , 27 ] . 
 the presence of one or more diagnostic codes in any position up to 3 years prior to measurement entry will be considered to define comorbidity history . 
 patient demographics included sex and date of birth ( month and year ) , migration procedures ( when applicable date of registration as county citizen and date of departure / emigration ) , and ascribed municipality of residency according to the national classification of statistics sweden . 
 information on race is not available in sweden by law , and in accordance with the general population characteristics , it was assumed that all patients were of caucasian origin . 
 icd-10 codes and therapeutic procedures were retrieved for each individual since 1997 and up to 31 december 2012 . 
 the scream dataset was thereafter sent to the national board of health and welfare , to be linked to the following national quality registers : the swedish prescribed drug registry , a nationwide registry instituted in 2005 and collecting information on all prescription drugs dispensed at swedish pharmacies . 
 it also contains information on the practice ( primary health care centre or clinic ) and profession / medical specialty of the prescriber . 
 drugs were reported by their generic names as well as active principle atc codes , together with the number of defined daily doses dispensed and the costs ( both reimbursed expenditure and patient co - payment ) . 
 this register did not contain information on over - the - counter pharmaceuticals , nor ambulatory or in - hospital care drugs given at hospitals . 
 drug dispensing data were requested for each individual since 2006 and up to 31 december 2012 . 
 the swedish population registry recorded , on a monthly basis , information on vital status for each swedish citizen with virtually no loss to follow - up . in case of death , 
 vital status information was requested for each individual from inclusion in scream up to 31 december 2012 . 
 the longitudinal integration database for health insurance and labour market studies ( lisa by swedish acronym ) ( http://www.scb.se/en_/services/guidance-for-researchers-and-universities/scb-data/longitudinal-integration-database-for-health-insurance-and-labour-market-studies-lisa-by-swedish-acronym/.eng ) combined information from several sociodemographic population registers . 
 all swedish citizens older than 16 years residing in sweden as of 31 december were registered and the information was updated on a yearly basis . 
 the swedish renal registry   included swedish patients referred to a nephrologist and diagnosed with ckd . 
 inclusion was encouraged to all hospitals from ckd stage 3b and considered mandatory from the first diagnosis of ckd stage 4 . 
 information from patient visits during the non - dialysis phase and until renal replacement therapy start ( first chronic dialysis or renal transplantation ) was collected , with additional data collection on primary kidney disease , laboratory tests ( such as uric acid ) and in - hospital provided drugs to treat kidney diseases . upon start of dialysis , a patient visit was recorded annually detailing in addition dialysis modality and specifications ( dialysis dose , fistula / graft , etc . ) . 
 information from this registry was requested since its establishment in 1999 up to 31 december 2012 . 
 after all requested data were linked , patient identification was substituted by a random identifier , safeguarding patient privacy and confidentiality . 
 the key to decipher the identifiers was kept at the national board of health and welfare for amendments , follow - up expansions and/or new linkages to the extraction . 
 only then , the complete scream project , including more than 200 datasets , was sent to the responsible investigators . 
 data were analysed according to our university rules and ethical standards and the project was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of stockholm . 
 in parallel with building the scream dataset sll was developing a clinical decision support system for the prescription of pharmaceutical drugs to patients with reduced kidney function ( njuren ) . 
 njuren was an electronic application integrated to the health - records that assists prescribers by automatically estimating kidney function using the latest available creatinine assessment , gender and age . by combining this information with the information on prescribed drugs the prescriber was informed , when applicable , of kidney  drug contraindications , nephrotoxicity , and the need for dose adjustment and/or safer drug alternatives for the patient . 
 this current scream extraction will serve to document idu rates and its clinical consequences in the region of stockholm . 
 scream will identify which drugs , medical specialties and population segments are susceptible to idu , and this knowledge will be used to develop educational / corrective programs . during 2017 , a second laboratory extraction will take place ( scream-2 ) , adding laboratory assessments and clinical practices for the period 201216 . 
 this will serve to assess the effectiveness of njuren implementation by comparing the expected change in inappropriate drug utilization rates among njuren participating centres . 
 this analysis of program effectiveness will motivate the expansion of njuren to other regions in sweden . 
 additionally , the second data extraction will allow capturing recent drugs and clinical practice changes .

 the coverage of scream was assessed by comparing the number of scream individuals with the complete stockholm population . for that purpose , 
 this included adult ( 18 years old ) citizens of the stockholm region during 200611 ( n = 1 706 259 individuals ) . citizenship was ascertained by being censored in any of the 26 municipalities of the region at least once during the study period . for comparative purposes , 
 summary statistics for age and sex strata as well as number of citizens per municipality were provided and compared with scream . since assessment of creatinine was particularly indicated in specific comorbidities , we ascertained the coverage of scream in cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus patients . for this , we classified individuals according to the presence of at least one relevant icd-10 code during the period coming from a secondary or tertiary healthcare consultation . 
 cardiovascular disease was defined with the following four charlson domains [ 26 , 27 ] : acute myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease ; diabetes mellitus was defined with the two charlson domains of diabetes . 
 finally , being this an extraction of individuals seeking healthcare , we expected to have a sicker population with an over - representation of occurring deaths . to that end 
 , we compared the number of deaths per calendar year in scream with those recorded for the general population .

 finally , being this an extraction of individuals seeking healthcare , we expected to have a sicker population with an over - representation of occurring deaths . to that end 
 , we compared the number of deaths per calendar year in scream with those recorded for the general population . 
 scream identified a total of 1 344 197 individuals with at least one serum creatinine assessed during the study period . for this analysis , we excluded individuals not residing in the stockholm county ( n = 85 667 ) and those younger than 18 years old ( n = 140 023 ) . 
 therefore , the analysis of scream coverage and representativeness was based on 1 118 507 stockholm citizens in the adult age range . 
 roughly , one - third of the stockholm population underwent at least one creatinine assessment annually ( 25 , 34 , 35 , 36 , 34 and 33% across the years 200611 , respectively ) . since 
 different individuals were assessed every year , the number of unique individuals with creatinine assessed during the whole period 200611 corresponded to 66% of the stockholm population . the coverage was equally distributed throughout the 26 municipalities of the region , ranging from 62% coverage in stockholm city , to 72% in norrtlje ( figure 2 ) . 
 the coverage was slightly higher for women than for men in the age range of 1864 years , thereafter becoming equal between the sexes . 
 because creatinine assessment is more frequently assessed in older ages , scream 's coverage increased with age ; scream captured 50% of all individuals in the range of 1844 years old , > 75% of individuals aged 4564 years and > 90% of all individuals aged 65 years old . 
 the distribution of age and sex in scream was very similar to that of the stockholm population ( figure 3b ) . 
 3.proportion of the stockholm population included in scream , stratified by age and sex ( a ) ; age and sex distribution in scream and in the complete stockholm population ( b ) . 
 proportion of the stockholm population included in scream , stratified by age and sex ( a ) ; age and sex distribution in scream and in the complete stockholm population ( b ) . 
 as many as 98% ( 121 785 versus 124 092 ) of all individuals with a cardiovascular disease ( cvd)-related diagnosis are captured by scream . 
 likewise , 97% ( 78 125 versus 80 188 ) of individuals with a diabetes code were included . 
 the proportion of cvd and diabetes cases in scream and in the general population was rather similar ( figure 4 ) , with an expected slight overrepresentation of both diseases in scream . during 200611 
 , 91 353 deaths occurred in the general population . according to our 66% population coverage , 
 61 000 deaths were to be anticipated in scream . in all , 89% ( n = 81 270 ) of deaths were captured in scream , being the expected difference attributed to the selection criterion of individuals in need of healthcare . 
 4.proportion of individuals with cvd ( a ) or diabetes mellitus ( b ) ascertained by icd-10 codes from secondary or tertiary healthcare consultations during 200611 in the stockholm population and in scream . 
 proportion of individuals with cvd ( a ) or diabetes mellitus ( b ) ascertained by icd-10 codes from secondary or tertiary healthcare consultations during 200611 in the stockholm population and in scream . 
 the scream cohort represents to date the largest patient material to estimate the burden and implications of ckd in sweden , and probably one of the most comprehensive healthcare extractions to assess the implications of kidney function in healthcare management . 
 the coverage and representativeness of the region of stockholm is high and in accordance with both the commonness of creatinine assessment in healthcare , and medical indications for creatinine tests . 
 the richness of information retrieved , including both laboratory values and complete healthcare utilization data is unique and can be used for the study of other chronic medical conditions beyond ckd . 
 strengths of scream are the personal identity number unique to all swedish citizens and the possibility to continuously enrich data , increasing completeness and minimizing loss to follow - up . 
 since healthcare in sweden is tax - financed ( to a large extent including also the cost of medications ) , we believe that confounding related to socioeconomic status , affecting the probability of adhering to the treatment , is lower than in other countries . 
 however , there are important limitations as well ; first , we use the existence of creatinine assessment to define our study cohort , which although reflects standard clinical practices , limits our study to subjects who have sought medical care and had a creatinine test undertaken ( selection bias ) . 
 the indications for creatinine measurement in scream are unknown . however , judging by the high representativeness of the stockholm population , especially among the older age stratum , this is unlikely to invalidate our findings . 
 finally , we lack certain clinical variables of importance such as body mass index , blood pressure and lifestyle factors ( smoking habits , exercise ) , which may confound our conclusions . 
 nevertheless , some of them can be indirectly captured by specific ascertainment of comorbidities and medications . 
 other healthcare extractions have been performed in the past , but representativeness has seldom been estimated in those . 
 scream is a cohort by indication of assessment , and from this analysis , it can be concluded that scream findings can be well generalized to the elderly individuals ( 65 years old ) of our region ( > 90% coverage ) . 
 likely , scream can be fairly generalized to individuals in the age range 4564 years ( > 75% coverage ) . 
 the lowest representativeness is found for younger ages ( < 45 years ) , which may not have the same indications for creatinine testing . 
 this prompts the need to stratify future study results across these age ranges and ponder both patient selection and conclusions having coverage and testing by indication in mind . 
 the coverage of diseases with indications for creatinine testing is also virtually complete ( > 97% ) , that is , all patients with diabetes or cvd during the observation period have had at least one creatinine test . 
 thus , scream has an excellent quality to study cardio - renal and diabeto - renal complications , treatments and management . in an ulterior sphere 
 , this analysis shows that creatinine is already measured in a larger proportion of the community . 
 although screening programs are necessary , improved patient care can be achieved by interpreting the information that we already have and integrated in the medical decision process . 
 community approaches to pharmacy - idu are scarce , with previous evidence focussing on restricted population segments such as the elderly or restricted to in - hospital admissions and single - centre experiences [ 13 , 15 , 1921 ] . 
 it has been demonstrated that clinical decision support systems to guide medication dosing improved the appropriateness of dosage by 13% and appropriateness of frequency by 24% in the usa . in a cross - sectional trial from belgium , the implementation of a computer - assisted medical support system in the intensive care unit - setting , reduced by 3-fold the rate of medication prescription errors in patients with renal insufficiency . 
 we are positive that our efforts to identify idu coupled with the implementation of njuren in our region may improve this . 
 to conclude , scream is a region - representative repository of laboratory data linked to regional and national registers that can be used for health services and health policy research in which kidney function has or may have an impact . 
 research collaborations are certainly welcome , including as well the possibility to link scream data to other swedish registers via each citizen 's personal identification number . 
 the scream project has obtained financial support from sll , the regional agreement on medical training and clinical research ( alf ) between sll and karolinska institutet , the swedish medical research council ( vetenskapsrdet ) , martin rind s and westman s foundations .

scream cohort indication assessment analysis concluded scream findings well generalized elderly individuals years old region coverage","backgroundwe here describe the construction of the stockholm creatinine measurement ( scream ) cohort and assess its coverage / representativeness of the stockholm county in sweden . 
 scream has the principal aims to estimate the burden and consequences of chronic kidney disease ( ckd ) and to identify inappropriate drug use ( prescription of nephrotoxic , contraindicated or ill - dosed drugs).methodsscream is a repository of laboratory data of individuals , residing or accessing healthcare in the region of stockholm , who underwent creatinine assessments between 200611 . 
 laboratory tests were linked to administrative databases with complete information on socioeconomic status , demographic data , healthcare utilization , diagnoses , vital status and dispensed prescription medicines.resultsscream identified 1 118 507 adult stockholm citizens with available creatinine tests between 200611 . 
 this corresponded to 66% of the complete population in the region . 
 geographical coverage was uniform , ranging between 62 and 72% throughout its 26 municipalities . 
 population coverage was higher across older age strata ( 50% coverage for age range 1844 years , > 75% for 4564 years and 
 > 90% coverage for 65 years ) . of note , 
 97 and 98% of all individuals with a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease , respectively , were captured by scream . 
 further , 89% of all deaths registered in the period occurred in individuals with a creatinine test undertaken.conclusionscream represents the largest cohort to estimate the burden and healthcare implications of ckd in sweden . 
 the coverage and representativeness of the region of stockholm was high and in accordance to both the commonness of creatinine assessment , and the medical indications for creatinine testing . 
 the inclusion of individuals who sought medical care and had a creatinine test undertaken resulted in a slight over - representation of elderly and comorbid patients ."
"alzheimer 's disease ( ad ) is the most common cause of dementia in the aging population . 
 this disease develops over time and leads to significant cognitive deficits affecting memory , insight , judgment , abstraction , and language functions . 
 ad affects more than 5 million people in the united states and this number is projected to rise to 35 million by 2050 [ 2 , 3 ] . 
 this estimate underscores both the scope of this health care issue for the society as a whole and the need for the development of therapeutic options for these patients . 
 the diagnosis of this neurodegenerative disease relies on the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in affected brain areas at autopsy . 
 these ad hallmark lesions are the results of the pathological deposition of proteins normally present throughout the brain . 
 senile plaques are composed of extracellular deposits of beta - amyloid ( a ) derived by proteolytic cleavage from the amyloid precursor protein ( app ) [ 410 ] . 
 neurofibrillary tangles , on the other hand , are intracellular bundles of self - assembled tau proteins [ 1138 ] . the formation of both senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles is associated with progressive and irreversible degeneration of neuronal processes and the loss of synaptic connections [ 3950 ] .    initially , multiple studies focused on defining the characteristics of ad and on the analysis of the composition of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles . 
 more recently , data have been obtained on the molecular mechanisms that link the formation of these lesions and underlie neurodegeneration and cell death in ad and related disorders . 
 calpains are ca - dependent proteases in which activity is dysregulated in ad and other neurodegenerative diseases [ 5154 ] . 
 a growing body of evidence suggests that the abnormal activation of calpains might modulate not only the formation of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles but also the development of synaptic pathology in ad . 
 these data reviewed below position calpains at the crossroads of the mechanisms involved in the formation of the main pathological alterations associated with ad . 
 furthermore , these findings underscore the importance of calpains as potential targets to block the activation of the signaling cascades leading to degeneration in ad . in turn 
 , this information could be applied to the design of therapeutic options and prevention strategies for this devastating disease .    in this review , we first summarized data on the properties of calpains and the mechanisms underlying their activation . then , we reviewed findings on the dysregulation of calpain in the context of ad and its deleterious consequences for the morphology and function of affected brain areas . 
 calpains constitute a family of ca - dependent cysteine proteases involved in multiple and very diverse cell functions including cell development , proliferation , and differentiation , cell motility , growth cone motility and guidance , apoptosis , learning , and memory , among others [ 51 , 52 ] . 
 originally , two members of this family were identified : calpain 1 ( -calpain ) and calpain 2 ( m - calpain ) , also known as conventional or classical calpains . 
 more recently , the other 14 members of the calpain family have been identified in mammals [ 51 , 55 ] . 
 in contrast to classical calpains that are ubiquitously distributed , the expression of some of these unconventional or nonclassical calpains is tissue specific . 
 for example , calpain 3a and calpain 8 are mainly present in skeletal and smooth muscle cells , respectively . 
 calpain 11 , on the other hand , is highly expressed in testes , while calpain 13 is concentrated in the lung and skin . 
 others , like calpains 5 , 7 , 9 , and 10 have more widespread distributions . 
 none of these new members of the calpain family are highly expressed in the central nervous system ( cns ) . 
 both calpain 1 and calpain 2 are heterodimers composed of a large catalytic subunit ( ~80  kda ) and a small regulatory subunit ( ~30  kda ) . 
 based on this sequence , the catalytic subunit has been divided into four distinct domains ( reviewed in ) . 
 domain 1 corresponds to the n - terminal region of this subunit and undergoes autolysis upon ca binding . 
 domain 2 contains a catalytic unit formed by cys , his , and asn residues . 
 domain 4 has partial homology with calmodulin and contains several ef - hand calcium - binding motifs . 
 the regulatory subunit can be divided into two domains , a calmodulin - like domain and a glycine - rich domain . 
 while both proteases are present in neurons and glial cells , their relative abundance differs . 
 calpain 1 is more abundant in neurons , and calpain 2 is prominent in glial cells . 
 analysis of the subcellular localization of these enzymes demonstrated that calpain 1 is concentrated in the cell bodies and is also detected in the processes extended by central neurons , although at lower levels . 
 calpain 1 immunoreactivity has been also detected in postsynaptic densities as well as in dendritic spines . 
 astrocytic processes are also enriched in calpain 2 [ 62 , 63 ] . calpains cleave proteins generating large fragments . 
 initially , it was thought that these proteases ' cleavage sites have a leu or a val residue in the p2 position . 
 more recently , it has been shown that the cleavage site specificity is determined by conformation rather than amino acid sequence [ 6568 ] . 
 the specificities of the substrates for both calpains are very similar but not identical . in vitro studies 
 calpain substrates include cytoskeletal proteins ( cadherin , catenin , desmin , dystrophin , gelsolin , filamin , fodrin , microtubule - associated proteins map 1 and map 2 , neurofilament proteins , spectrin , tau , talin , troponin , tubulin , vimentin , and vinculin ) , signal transduction proteins ( calcium / calmodulin - dependent protein kinase , epidermal growth factor ( egf ) kinase , pp60 , protein kinase c , calcineurin , and caspases 3 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 12 , and 14 ) , synaptic proteins ( dynamin 1 , postsynaptic density ( psd ) 95 , n - methyl - d - aspartic acid ( nmda ) glutamate receptors , and metabotropic glutamate receptor glur1 ) , and transcription factors ( p53 ) , among others [ 51 , 53 ] .   calpain activation is tightly regulated to prevent massive proteolytic activity in the cell . 
 the binding of ca to either calpain results in conformational changes that initiate their proteolytic activity . 
 while calpain 1 is activated in the presence of micromolar concentrations of ca , calpain 2 requires millimolar concentrations . 
 the ca requirement for either calpain is significantly higher than the concentration of this ion in living cells . 
 this fact has prompted a series of studies on potential mechanisms that could lead to a decrease in the ca requirement for the activation of these proteases in living cells . in vitro studies 
 have shown that the interaction of calpains with a series of activator molecules lowers the concentration of ca required to initiate the activation of these proteases . among them , phospholipids ( i.e. , phosphatidylinositol ) are the most studied . 
 however , the phospholipid to calpain molar ratio required for lowering the ca requirement for either calpain activation is not likely to be achieved in the cellular context [ 6971 ] . 
 nevertheless , it can not be ruled out that higher concentrations of ca are achieved in limited cellular areas where ca is not easily detectable by available methods . in turn 
 , these local micromolar or millimolar ca concentrations could trigger calpain activation in distinct subcellular domains . 
 in addition to ca , calpastatin has a key role in the regulation of calpain . 
 calpastatin , a heat - stable protein ranging from ~70 to ~140  kda of apparent molecular weight depending on the cell type , is considered a specific endogenous inhibitor of calpains . 
 immunocytochemical analysis showed calpastatin immunoreactivity throughout the dendritic tree in pyramidal neurons and purkinje cells . 
 therefore , the ratio calpain / calpastatin plays a key role in the regulation of calpain activity [ 7880 ] . 
 the inhibitory effect of calpastatin requires ca - dependent high - affinity binding to three sites of calpain . 
 the kinases responsible for the phosphorylation of some of these sites have already been identified . 
 thus , two of those sites seem to be phosphorylated by protein kinase c ( pkc ) , two by protein kinase a ( pka ) , two by calmodulin kinase ii , one site by casein kinase i , and another by protein kinase g . 
 although the role of the phosphorylation of each site in calpain activation has not been completely elucidated , data suggest that phosphorylation mediated by mitogen - activated kinases ( erk / map kinases ) activates these proteases . on the other hand , phosphorylation by pka may decrease their activity [ 82 , 83 ] . 
 as briefly reviewed above , calpain activation is a tightly regulated process to prevent deleterious consequences of massive proteolytic activity . 
 these regulatory mechanisms seem to decline with aging resulting in an increased calpain activity [ 8487 ] . 
 thus , several studies have reported significantly increased activation of calpains in ad brains [ 8894 ] . 
 the hyperactivation of calpain in the context of ad is the result of several factors including enhanced intracellular ca concentration and decreased calpastatin levels . 
 experiments performed using an ad culture model system showed that oligomeric a induced a significant ( 5-fold ) and instantaneous rise in ca in hippocampal neurons [ 9597 ] . 
 these studies also addressed the source of the ca influx leading to calpain activation in the context of ad taking advantage of specific blockers of ca release from the endoplasmic reticulum , the major source of intracellular ca , and bapta , a chelator of extracellular ca . 
 the data obtained showed that a induces calpain activation by enhancing extracellular ca influx [ 9597 ] . 
 the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the enhanced ca influx and calpain activation in ad have also been studied . 
 both nmda receptors and voltage - gated calcium channels ( vgcc ) have been implicated in such regulation in central neurons [ 99101 ] . 
 specific nmda receptor inhibitors , mk801 , and the fda approved nmda receptor antagonist memantine   significantly attenuated the initial a-induced increase of ca and blocked a-induced calpain activation in cultured hippocampal neurons [ 9597 ] . in contrast , 
 nimodipine , an l - type vsccs blocker , did not decrease the a-induced activation of calpain [ 9597 ] . 
 these data suggest that nmda receptors play an important role in mediating the sustained ca influx and enhanced calpain activity induced by aggregated a. furthermore , these studies suggested that factors that affect nmda receptor - mediated ca influx could modulate calpain activation and its deleterious effects in central neurons . 
 recently , it has been shown that cholesterol regulates calpain activity in the context of ad . 
 a population - based study demonstrated that not only high cholesterol levels but also moderately elevated cholesterol levels in midlife represent a significant risk factor for ad [ 106 , 107 ] . 
 interestingly , cholesterol has been implicated in the susceptibility of cells to ca influx [ 108111 ] . 
 thus , elevated membrane cholesterol actually increased the susceptibility of cells to a-induced elevation in ca influx leading to cell death via a calpain - dependent mechanism [ 111 , 112 ] . by regulating the nmda receptor content and changing their localization in membrane microdomains at the synaptic sites 
 , cholesterol modulates the ability of a to induce ca influx , leading to calpain activation in hippocampal neurons [ 111 , 112 ] . 
 calpastatin also seems to play an important role in the regulation of calpain activation in ad . 
 thus , it has been shown that calpastatin is markedly depleted in the cortex of ad brains at late stages of the disease as compared to age - matched controls . 
 focal areas of calpastatin depletion have been also detected along dystrophic neurites at early stages of ad . 
 on the other hand , no changes in calpastatin levels were detected in neurons less susceptible to neurodegeneration in ad like purkinje cells . 
 this decrease in calpastatin levels is the result of the proteolytic activity of caspases and calpain . in turn , the decrease in the ratio calpastatin to calpain causes calpain hyperactivation perpetuating this cellular deleterious effect [ 79 , 113115 ] . 
 these findings have been complemented with immunocytochemical studies on the distribution of calpain in ad . 
 these studies have shown intense calpain immunoreactivity in dystrophic neurites associated with neurofibrillary tangles , neuritic plaques , and neuropil threads in the hippocampal region and entorhinal cortex of subjects suffering from ad and other tauopathies [ 116118 ] . based on this information , 
 it was hypothesized that the enhanced calpain activity observed in ad brains plays an important role in the formation of senile plaques , neurofibrillary tangles , and synaptic dysfunction in the context of ad ( figure 1 ) . 
 these peptides are the result of the sequential proteolytic cleavage of app by two proteases . 
 first , -secretase ( -site app - cleaving enzyme ( bace 1 ) ) cuts app at the n - terminus of the a domain leaving a 99-amino - acid - long c - terminal fragment . 
 then , the -secretase complex ( presenilin 1 , presenilin 2 , nicastrin , aph1 , and pen2 ) cuts the c - terminus to generate a peptides of 38 to 43 amino acids in length [ 5 , 119121 ] . of these peptides , 
 therefore , increased levels of bace 1 could lead to enhanced production of a , its aggregation , and consequently the activation of signaling pathways associated with the neurodegenerative process . 
 thus , a 2-fold increase in bace1 levels has been detected in ad brains [ 127129 ] . 
 recently , it has been shown that the calpain / calpastatin system can modulate the pathological deposition of a. calpain activation increases the levels of bace1 in a transgenic mouse model of ad . 
 in addition , the bidirectional regulation of the activation of the calpain / calpastatin system and a metabolism has been established . using transgenic mice overexpressing app 
 , these authors showed that calpastatin deficiency enhanced calpain activation , a production , and increased mortality . in turn , the increased levels of a lead to enhanced ca influx and increased calpain activation . 
 senile plaques are often surrounded by dystrophic neurons that contain tau aggregates known as neurofibrillary tangles . 
 many studies have focused on the composition and the mechanisms underlying the formation of tau aggregates . 
 those studies have identified two types of tau filaments in the neurofibrillary tangles : straight and paired helical filaments . 
 tau hyperphosphorylation has been attributed to the increased activity of several kinases , including cyclin - dependent kinase 5 ( cdk5 ) , glycogen synthase kinase  ( gsk ) , and the mitogen - activated protein kinase ( mapk ) in hippocampal neurons [ 138 , 143145 ] . 
 thus , it has been shown that calpain cleaves the inhibitory domain of gsk3 generating two fragments of 40 and 30  kda . 
 the latter has a longer half life than p35 and therefore it is a more potent activator of cdk5 . 
 experiments using calpeptin , a cell permeable calpain inhibitor , blocked both erk 1 and erk 2 activation . 
 conditions that blocked the activation of these kinases induced a decreased in tau phosphorylation and resulted in enhanced neuronal survival in the presence of a . besides tau phosphorylation 
 , calpain activation might play a role in tau - mediated neurodegeneration by inducing tau cleavage . in vitro studies 
 have shown that both fetal and adult tau isoforms are rapidly proteolyzed by calpains [ 151153 ] . 
 on the other hand , tau present in paired - helical filaments is considerably more resistant to proteolysis by these proteases [ 153156 ] . 
 these findings suggest that phosphorylation might regulate the susceptibility of tau to calpain - mediated cleavage . 
 tau obtained from cultured neurons incubated in the presence of this phosphatase inhibitor was more resistant to calpain cleavage than tau extracted from nontreated control neurons . 
 nevertheless , the effect of phosphorylation on calpain - mediated tau cleavage seems to be complex . 
 this effect might depend on the site phosphorylated and/or the extent of phosphorylation under pathological conditions since highly phosphorylated fetal isoforms are readily cleaved by calpain . 
 calpain - mediated tau cleavage seems to play an important role under neurodegenerative conditions [ 157164 ] . 
 it has been shown that calpain activation results in the generation of several n - terminal tau fragments . 
 one of such tau fragments , of ~20  kda of apparent molecular weight , has been detected in mitochondria present in synaptosomal fractions obtained from ad brains . 
 the levels of this tau fragment are partially reduced when cultured neurons are treated with a calpain inhibitor . 
 it has been shown that tau fragments containing the 2644 tau amino acids affect mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation acting at the level of the adenine nucleotides translocator contributing to synapse dysfunction . 
 a smaller tau fragment generated by calpain cleavage has been detected in mature hippocampal neurons treated with aggregated a oligomers [ 160 , 161 ] . 
 a-induced tau cleavage mediated by calpain 1 leads to the generation of a neurotoxic 17  kda tau fragment ( tau 45230 ) in cultured hippocampal neurons [ 160 , 161 ] . 
 this fragment has also been detected in the neocortex of ad brains as well as in brain areas affected by other tauopathies . 
 furthermore , when expressed in neuronal and nonneuronal cell types or in an in vivo drosophila model system , the 17  kda tau fragment produced cell death in the absence of a oligomers [ 160 , 161 , 163 ] . 
 these data provided strong evidence for an important role of calpain 1 and the generation of the 17  kda tau fragment in the progression of a-mediated neurodegeneration . 
 it is worth noting that calpain 2 activation cleaves tau generating a smaller tau fragment that lacks neurotoxic effects in central neurons . 
 in addition to the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles , ad brains are characterized by a decrease in synaptic contacts . 
 this synaptic loss seems to be the best morphological correlate of the functional deficits observed in the mid to late stages of ad [ 39 , 40 ] . 
 although no significant decline in synapse number has been detected in the earliest stages of the disease , a stage of synaptic dysfunction seems to precede frank synapse loss [ 41 , 46 , 165 ] . by cleaving proteins in the presynaptic terminals and/or the postsynaptic elements 
 changes in proteins involved in synaptic vesicle biogenesis and/or recycling at synaptic terminals are responsible , at least in part , for the synaptic dysfunction detected in ad . 
 recently , data obtained using culture and animal models of ad showed that a induced a significant reduction in dynamin 1 levels that preceded synapse loss . 
 dynamin 1 pinches off synaptic vesicles , freeing them from the membrane and allowing them to reenter the synaptic vesicle pool to be refilled for future release [ 167 , 168 ] . 
 decreased levels of this protein lead to the depletion of synaptic vesicles and the accumulations of invaginated pits at presynaptic membranes adjacent to the synaptic clefts [ 9597 , 169 , 170 ] . 
 the a-induced decrease in dynamin 1 is a result , at least partially , of calpain - mediated proteolysis [ 9597 , 171 ] . 
 thus , it has been shown that calpain activation results in the breakdown of several proteins leading to changes in the ultrastructure of the postsynaptic density ( psd ) . 
 these changes in the psd are accompanied by the rapid cleavage of psd-95 and the nmda receptor subunits nr1 and nr2a and 2b [ 172175 ] . 
 calpain has been shown to truncate also mglur1 exacerbating nmda - mediated neurotoxicity [ 176178 ] . 
 an additional mechanism by which calpain activation can result in synaptic dysfunction involved the cleavage of pka leading to a decrease in both the regulatory and the catalytic subunits of this kinase . 
 the decrease in pka activity attenuates creb activation impairing memory [ 179 , 180 ] . 
 taken together , the data reviewed above strongly suggest that calpains play an important role in the neurodegeneration mechanisms underlying ad in the aging population . based on these data 
 , it has been tempting to speculate that calpain inhibition could be a useful tool to prevent neurodegeneration in this disease . to obtain further insights into the beneficial effects of blocking calpain activation , several studies 
 have been conducted using experimental approaches to either suppress the expression of these proteases or prevent their abnormal activation . 
 early studies using gene deletion of the calpain regulatory subunit by homologous recombinant techniques showed that the depletion of these proteases is embryonic lethal . 
 the data obtained showed that indeed the suppression of calpain 1 expression by means of these specific probes prevented oxidative stress - induced cell injury in human hepatic cancer cell lines . 
 other studies have assessed the effects of calpain inhibitors on cell death in culture model systems of ad . 
 leupeptin and e64 calpain inhibitors had protective effects in those cultures [ 160 , 183186 ] . 
 the idea that calpain could be a potential therapeutic target in neurodegenerative diseases has been reinforced by studies performed in vitro and in culture using the calpain inhibitor mdl 28170 . 
 those studies suggested a protective effect of calpain inhibitors against excitotoxicity [ 178 , 187 , 188 ] . 
 unfortunately , the potential use of known calpain inhibitors as therapeutic tools in ad is limited due to their low cellular penetration , poor selectivity , and kinetics . recently , 
 this benzoylalanine - derived ketoamide is capable of inhibiting calpain in nanomolar concentrations and has improved oral bioavailability , water solubility , and metabolic stability . 
 this calpain inhibitor is highly effective in preventing calpain - mediated cleavage of dynamin 1 and tau in cultured hippocampal neurons . 
 this inhibitor is effective not only when added prior to the a treatment but also when added simultaneously with a and even when added after a has triggered the neurodegeneration process . 
 the calpain inhibitor a-705253 also prevents a oligomer - induced neurodegeneration of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis . 
 these experiments raised the possibility that more potent calpain inhibitors could have beneficial effects even at late stages of ad . 
 moreover , initial studies using calpain inhibitors in mouse and rat models of ad showed an encouraging recovery of cognitive function in these animals when they were treated with calpain inhibitors at an early age [ 186 , 190 ] . together , these data underscore the potential importance of calpain inhibitors as promising therapeutic tools in ad and related neurodegenerative diseases . 
 in summary , the data briefly reviewed above provide strong support for the role of calpains in ad . 
 they also highlight the tantalizing possibility that these proteases could serve as targets for the development of therapeutic interventions for this disease , one of the main challenges for decades to come in ad research .","originally two members family identified calpain calpain calpain calpain also known conventional classical calpains

 the data obtained from those studies suggest that the mechanisms leading to the formation of the hallmark lesions of ad might be linked . 
 one of such mechanisms seems to be the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis that results in the abnormal activation of calpains . 
 calpains are a family of ca2 + -dependent cysteine proteases that play a key role in multiple cell functions including cell development , differentiation and proliferation , axonal guidance , growth cone motility , and cell death , among others . in this paper , we briefly reviewed data on the structure of these proteases and their regulation under normal conditions . 
 we also summarized data underscoring the participation of calpains in the neurodegenerative mechanisms associated with ad ."
"helicobacter pylori is a gram - negative , spiral and microaerophilic microorganism that was first isolated from the stomach of patients afflicted with peptic ulcer ( 1 , 2 ) . 
 this bacterium can cause gastritis and peptic ulcer in the short - term and carcinoma of the stomach in the long - term ( 3 , 4 ) . 
 polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) is the desired method of proving the presence of h. pylori in tissues due to its high sensitivity and specificity ( 5 , 6 ) . 
 it was previously thought that the human stomach was the sole source of h. pylori ; however , it was later found that they are present in human dental plaques , mouth , saliva , tonsils , adenoids , middle ear , nasal polyps and sinus mucosa ( 7 ) . 
 it is believed that gastroesophageal reflux is involved in many cases of upper respiratory tract disorders including pharyngoesophageal disorders , croup , oropharyngeal dysphagia , rhinosinusitis , otalgia and different forms of otitis media ( 8 , 9 ) . 
 samples from tonsil and adenoid tissues showed that they might be sources of h. pylori ( 10 , 11 ) . 
 researchers have proved that there is a connection between chronic tubotympanal disorders and gastroesophageal reflux , but the mechanism is unknown ( 12 , 13 ) . 
 it is suspected that gastroesophageal reflux is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic otitis media . 
 evidence showed that stomach pepsin is present in the middle ear cavity of patients afflicted with chronic otitis media , as compared to the control group , supports this suspicion ( 14 , 15 ) . 
 gastroesophageal reflux results in the appearance of otolaryngology symptoms in children and anti - reflux treatments reduce frequency of infection in the middle ear ( 16 ) . 
 many studies have been conducted on otitis media with effusion and on its correlation with h. pylori ( 15 , 17 - 19 ) . 
 however , the correlation between chronic suppurative otitis media and its various aspects , such as tympanosclerosis in which deposition of acellular hyaline and calcified deposits accumulate in the lamina propria of the middle ear has not been sufficiently studied ( 20 , 21 ) . 
 so , we decided to use the pcr technique to determine the role of h. pylori in tympanosclerosis . 
 this case - control and cross - sectional study was conducted on patients who were diagnosed with chronic infection of the middle ear and were candidates to undergo surgery in the imam khomeini or apadana hospitals of ahvaz in 2013 . 
 patients who had operations for chronic infections of the middle ear and those who had ventilation tube inserted into their ears in the past were excluded from the study . 
 the middle ear mucosa of the patients was examined during the surgical operations and based on this clinical evaluation , they were placed in one of the four types of normal , edema and hypertrophy , hyalinized and sclerotic and polyploid with or without cholesteatoma and this classification was recorded in the questionnaire . during the operations 
 , samples were taken of the middle ear mucosa of the patients . in patients with sclerotic plaques , 
 the samples were kept under sterilized conditions at 20 degrees centigrade , and were eventually sent to the laboratory of jundishapur university of medical sciences , ahvaz , iran . in the laboratory , dna was extracted using the roche high - pure template pcr kit ( roche , germany ) according to the manufacture protocol . 
 primers used to amplify the typing region were va1-f ( a3436 ) 5-atggaaatacaacaaacacac-313 and va1-r ( c1226 ) 5-ctgcttgaatgcgccaaac-313 for amplified 286-bp band and vag - f 5-caatctgtcaatcaagcgag-14 and vag - r 5-ctagcgtcaaaataattccaagg-314 for amplified 630-bp . 
 the extracted dna was amplified using 5 l dna template , 0.3 l taq polymerase , 1 l dntp , 0.25 l each forward and reveres primers , 2 l mgcl2 and 5 l 10x pcr buffer , all mixed in a micro - tube and the ultimate volume reach to 50 l using nuclease - free distilled water . 
 after activation of reaction in 95c for 5 minutes , amplification performed for 35 cycles . 
 cycle program for first pair primers was as : 94c for 60 , 52c for 60 and 72c for 90 seconds . a final extension 72c for 5 minutes was the ultimate step of cycles . 
 for the second pair primers , cycle program was as : 94c for 30 seconds , 56c for 60 seconds and 72c for 90 seconds . 
 the chi - squared and the independent - samples t - test were also used to analyze the data . the selected level of significance was p < 0.05 . 
 fifty - six patients participated in this study , of whom 29 ( 51.8% ) were men and 27 ( 48.2% ) women . 
 the biopsy samples of the middle ear mucosa of 31 ( 55.4% ) patients were h. pylori - positive . of the 29 male patients , 15 cases were ( 51.7% ) h. pylori - positive , while of the 27 female patients 16 cases ( 59.3% ) were h. pylori - positive . 
 this difference was not significant in pearson s chi - squared test ( p = 0.571 ) . 
 the average age of h. pylori - positive patients was 30.3 years old ( standard deviation = 7.6 ) , while the average age of h. pylori - negative patients was 33.4 years ( standard deviation = 9.7 ) . 
 this difference was not significant in the independent samples t - test ( p = 0.571 ) . 
 therefore , there was no significant correlation between the presence of h. pylori and the age and gender of the patients . 
 the most common pathological type of middle ear mucosa was hyalinized and sclerotic type in 19 cases ( 33.9% ) . 
 the polyploid type with or without cholesteatoma type was reported in 15 ( 26% ) cases and the edematous and proliferative type with 12 ( 21% ) cases . 
 examination of the middle ear mucosa of the 19 patients of the hyalinized and sclerotic type revealed that 16 ( 84.2% ) were h. pylori - positive ( figure 1 ) and 3 ( 15.8% ) were h. pylori - negative ; while of the 37 patients whose middle ear mucosa was not sclerotic,15 cases ( 40.7% ) were h. pylori - positive ( figure 2 ) 22 ( 59.3% ) h. pylori - negative . 
 this was a significant difference ( p = 0.002 ) , which means there was a correlation between the presence of h. pylori and tympanosclerosis of the middle ear ( table 1 ) . 
 as for other types of middle ear mucosa ( normal , polypoid with or without cholesteatoma and edema with hypertrophy ) , there was no significant correlation between them and the presence of h. pylori . 
 l = ladder ( 100 bp ) , p = positive control , lanes are numbered in the following order from 1 to 2 : case h. pylori - positive ( 286 bp ) , case h. pylori - negative . 
 l = ladder ( 100 bp ) , p = positive control , lanes are numbered in the following order from 1 to 3 : case h. pylori - positive ( 630 bp ) , negative control , case h. pylori - negative . 
 results showed that 26 ( 46.4% ) of 56 patients had dry ears for at least three months before surgery . 
 of the 30 patients who did not have dry ears , 13 cases ( 34.3% ) were h. pylori - negative and 17(56.7% ) were h. pylori - positive . 
 this was not a significant difference in pearson s chi - squared test ( p = 0.832 ) . 
 40 ( 45.2% ) of the 31 patients with perforations of more than 50% were h. pylori - negative and 17 ( 54.8% ) were h. pylori - positive . 
 h. pylori was not significant in pearson s chi - squared test ( p = 0.931 ) . 
 therefore , there was no correlation between the presence of h. pylori and the size of the perforation or dryness of the middle ear . 
 zollner ( 22 ) was the first to use the term tympanosclerosis in 1956 to describe a common complication resulting from middle ear infections . 
 tympanosclerosis is an abnormal condition in the middle ear cavity in which lime particles accumulate in the tympanic membrane , tympanic cavity and ossicular chain ( 23 , 24 ) . 
 it is a long - term complication of infections of the middle ear ( 4 , 25 - 27 ) . in available reports , 
 the prevalence of tympanosclerosis varies from 14.1% in bhaya s report ( 28 ) to 35.64% in wu s study(21 ) . despite the extensive available information on the clinical , histologic and pathologic aspects of tympanosclerosis , 
 tympanosclerosis is observed as irreversible changes in the temporal bone ( 13 , 24 ) . 
 it is thought that gastroesophageal reflux may be involved in the pathogenesis of otitis media and evidence indicating the presence of stomach pepsin in the middle ear cavity of patients with otitis media , as compared to the control group , confirms it ( 14 , 29 ) . 
 gastroesophageal reflux results in the appearance of otolaryngology symptoms in children and anti - reflux treatments make frequent middle ear infections go away ( 16 ) . 
 many studies have been conducted on otitis media with effusion and on its correlation with h. pylori ( 15 , 17 , 18 ) ; however , the correlation between chronic suppurative otitis media and its various aspects such as tympanosclerosis has not been sufficiently investigated . in tympanosclerosis , 
 the process of deposition of acellular hyaline and calcium deposits in the lamina propria of the middle ear takes place , following which it is even possible for fixation of ossicles to occur leading to conductive hearing loss ( 20 ) . the exact etiology and pathogenesis of tympanosclerosis 
 are not completely known ( 9 ) . in some studies , tympanosclerosis has been observed also as a complication of frequent otitis ( 21 , 29 ) . in a recent research 
 , it has been suggested that h. pylori is the pathologic factor in tympanosclerosis ( 21 ) . in our research , 
 designed to study the correlation between h. pylori and tympanosclerosis , we found that h. pylori has a prevalence of 84.2% among patients with suppurative infection of the middle ear , while its prevalence was 40.5% in patients without tympanosclerosis . 
 this difference ( p = 0.002 ) indicates that h. pylori plays a role in the pathogenesis of tympanosclerosis . 
 ( 26 ) showed that there are similar risk factors , such as increased homocysteine levels , between coronary artery atherosclerosis and tympanosclerosis . 
 although tympanosclerosis and atherosclerosis are two separate pathologies , they have similar histological and pathophysiologic elements and the same genetic reason has been proposed for both ( 2 ) . 
 ( 30 ) studied evidence concerning the development of inflammation caused by h. pylori in 38 patients with atherosclerotic plaques who had undergone endarterectomy and found that in most of these patients h. pylori was correlated to the inflammation , which indicated the correlation between h. pylori and atherosclerosis . 
 ( 31 ) show that contact with h. pylori increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases even in the absence of other risk factors . 
 our findings suggest that h. pylori probably plays a role in the development of tympanosclerosis . 
 ( 26 ) carried out a case - control study and found that 100% of the patients with tympanosclerosis were h. pylori - positive while only 26.9% of the patients not suffering from tympanosclerosis were h. pylori - positive ( p < 0.01 ) ( 21 ) . results of our study , while confirming those of iriz et al . 
 ( 26 ) used the campylobacter - like organism ( clo ) test in h. pylori identification , while we employed the pcr method . since the pcr method is more accurate than the clo test , our results are probably more acceptable than those iriz et al . 
 ( 26 ) , both show that there is a correlation between the presence of h. pylori and tympanosclerosis , and suggest the presence of h. pylori as the etiology for this disease ; however , neither study can consider h. pylori as the definite pathogenesis for tympanosclerosis . to prove this correlation 
 , a study should be designed to evaluate the correlation between tympanosclerosis and h. pylori by considering those pathological changes found in the examination of the middle ear mucosa that attribute the presence of inflammatory symptoms to the activity of h. pylori in the middle ear . 
 this study offers a better understanding of the etiological and pathogenic aspects of h. pylori in tympanosclerosis that can be used in designing new treatment methods for this disease .","biopsy samples middle ear mucosa patients h pylori positive

 helicobacter pylori is one of the pathological and etiologic factors in the development of tympanosclerosis.objectives:the purpose of this study was to show the role of h. pylori in the different aspects of chronic suppurative otitis media using the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) technique.patients and methods : this case - control and cross - sectional study was performed on all patients with chronic otitis media , candidates for surgical operations , in 2013 . 
 they were allocated into the case group with tympanosclerosis and the control group without tympanosclerosis . during the surgical operation 
 , biopsy was done from middle ear and the samples were studied to see if they contained h. pylori using the pcr method.results:from a total of 19 patients with tympanosclerosis , 16 cases ( 84.2% ) were h. pylori positive , while in the control group 15 ( 45.4% ) cases out of the 37 cases were h. pylori positive , which showed a significant difference ( p = 0.002 ) . 
 age and gender of the patients , ear dryness and perforation size were not correlated with the presence or absence of h. pylori.conclusions:there is a significant correlation between tympanosclerosis and h. pylori ( p = 0.002 ) . 
 this correlation can single out h. pylori as a pathological factor in the development of tympanosclerosis ; however , further studies are needed to prove this correlation ."

 the basal and the fsk - induced camp levels as well as the pka activation in both cell lines are described in , . 
 cells were lysed in trizol ( invitrogen , carlsbad , ca ) and total rna was further purified with the rneasy kit ( qiagen , hilden , germany ) following manufacturer instructions . 
 rna quality and integrity was determined by an agilent 2100 bioanalyzer ( agilent technologies , santa clara , ca ) on rna nano chips . 
 single strand biotinylated cdna was generated as follows : 100  ng of total rna were subjected to 2  cycles of cdna synthesis with the ambion wt expression kit ( life technologies ) . the first cycle 
 - first strand synthesis is performed using an engineered set of random primers that exclude rrna - matching sequences and include the t7 promoter sequences .

 the following tests have been performed : a)meanb)medianc)sumd)maxmeane)gene set enrichment analysis ( gsea)f)parametric analysis of gene set enrichment ( page)g)reporter featuresh)wilcoxon rank - sum testi)tail strength . 
 gene set enrichment analysis ( gsea ) parametric analysis of gene set enrichment ( page ) wilcoxon rank - sum test tests ( a)(f ) used t - values computed in the differential expression analysis while tests ( g)(i ) used the corresponding p - values ( and log fold changes , for devising the directionality ) . 
 tests ( f ) , ( g ) , ( h ) computed gene set statistics significance via the theoretical null distribution , while the remaining ones via gene ( re)sampling . each test may return distinct p - values for each gene set ( i.e. , pathway ) in the following directionality classes : distinct - directional ( up or down ) , indicated as dist(up ) and dist(down ) , which tests if the expression of the gene set as a whole is regulated in a distinct direction ( either up or down ) . by definition , a gene set can not be significant in both classes as regulations in opposite directions will cancel out the effect.mixed-directional ( up or down ) , indicated as mix(up ) and mix(down ) , which tests if a significant subset of its genes are coordinately up- or down - regulated . 
 a gene set can be significant in both classes.non-directional , indicated as nondir , which tests if the expression of the gene set as a whole is significantly perturbed , discarding any information about directionality . 
 distinct - directional ( up or down ) , indicated as dist(up ) and dist(down ) , which tests if the expression of the gene set as a whole is regulated in a distinct direction ( either up or down ) . by definition 
 , a gene set can not be significant in both classes as regulations in opposite directions will cancel out the effect . 
 mixed - directional ( up or down ) , indicated as mix(up ) and mix(down ) , which tests if a significant subset of its genes are coordinately up- or down - regulated . 
 non - directional , indicated as nondir , which tests if the expression of the gene set as a whole is significantly perturbed , discarding any information about directionality . 
 a total of 35 p - value vectors over the 45 possible combinations for each contrast have been obtained since not all tests returned results for all the directionality classes . 
 the combined analysis of the p - values obtained by each gene set in the various directionality classes provides a clear picture of the ( possible ) regulation of that gene set . 
 consistency of the results has been empirically verified by computing the pairwise correlation between the p - value vectors . 
 2 depicts the correlation matrices of the p - value vectors of contrast nf / n on the left and of contrast 
 directionality classes of the p - value vectors are indicated by the annotation bars on the top and on the left of the two plots , while letters refer to the different gene set analysis tests as per the previous list . according to the plots , p - value vectors of the same directionality class ( obtained with different tests ) have strong correlation ( see , for example , the class dist(dn ) ) , p - value vectors of similar classes have a non - negligible correlation ( see , for example , mix(dn ) and dist(dn ) ) and 
 p - value vectors of opposite classes are inversely correlated ( see , for example , dist(dn ) and dist(up ) ) . 
 further confirmation is provided by the dendograms depicted on the sides , showing that tests of the same directionality class cluster together . 
 the only exception is test ( i )  tail strength  for the distinct down - directional class on both contrasts . despite that 
 , the p - values of the gene sets on these classes still appear to be in accordance ( albeit less correlated ) with the rest of the results and represent only a small perturbation that the final consensus analysis should easily accommodate . 
 principal component analysis ( pca ) of the same set of vectors provides a second empirical support to the consistency of the results computed by the different tests . 
 3 depicts each p - value vector ( represented as the corresponding letter , see the list above ) for contrast 
 nf / n ( left ) and contrast tf / t ( right ) in the space of its first three principal components ( x- and y - axes and size ) . 
 ideally , each directionality class ( represented by colors ) should cluster together in the resulting space . 
 the most evident outliers are those computed by test ( i ) for the distinct down - directional class , that are placed near the vectors of the mixed down - directional class . 
 piano  computes the overall consensus rank by first ranking each gene set in each directionality class for each method according to the predicted p - value . 
 these ranks are then aggregated according to the borda rule ( a single - winner election method ) . 
 4 depicts the aggregated ranks obtained by the gene sets that ranked in the first 5 positions in at least one directionality class . 
 directionality classes are represented as columns while numbers and colors represent the position of each gene set ( row ) in the aggregated rank of that column for both contrast nf / n ( left block ) and contrast tf / t ( right block ) . in general , a pathway can be considered significantly regulated in a particular directionality class if it ranks in the first positions ( albeit a general cut - off does not exist ) . 
 as expected , pathways ranking high ( i.e. , small numbers ) in a directionality class ( see , for example ,  ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes  ) are ranked low ( large numbers ) in the opposite directionality class . 
 such a representation provides a clear and concise comparison of the regulation of pathways in the two contrasts , highlighting common regulation of pathways in normal and transformed cells , like  ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes  , down - regulated in both nf / n and tf / t , and specific pathway regulations , different for the two cell lines , like the up - regulation of pathway  steroid biosynthesis  detected in tf / t but not in nf / n .

 2 depicts the correlation matrices of the p - value vectors of contrast nf / n on the left and of contrast tf / t on the right . 
 directionality classes of the p - value vectors are indicated by the annotation bars on the top and on the left of the two plots , while letters refer to the different gene set analysis tests as per the previous list . according to the plots , p - value vectors of the same directionality class ( obtained with different tests ) 
 have strong correlation ( see , for example , the class dist(dn ) ) , p - value vectors of similar classes have a non - negligible correlation ( see , for example , mix(dn ) and dist(dn ) ) and p - value vectors of opposite classes are inversely correlated ( see , for example , dist(dn ) and dist(up ) ) . 
 further confirmation is provided by the dendograms depicted on the sides , showing that tests of the same directionality class cluster together . 
 the only exception is test ( i )  tail strength  for the distinct down - directional class on both contrasts . despite that 
 , the p - values of the gene sets on these classes still appear to be in accordance ( albeit less correlated ) with the rest of the results and represent only a small perturbation that the final consensus analysis should easily accommodate . 
 principal component analysis ( pca ) of the same set of vectors provides a second empirical support to the consistency of the results computed by the different tests . 
 3 depicts each p - value vector ( represented as the corresponding letter , see the list above ) for contrast nf / n ( left ) and contrast tf / t ( right ) in the space of its first three principal components ( x- and y - axes and size ) . 
 ideally , each directionality class ( represented by colors ) should cluster together in the resulting space . 
 the most evident outliers are those computed by test ( i ) for the distinct down - directional class , that are placed near the vectors of the mixed down - directional class . 
 this confirms the observation made before for fig . 2 and , again , this should not represent an issue for the consensus analysis . 
 piano  computes the overall consensus rank by first ranking each gene set in each directionality class for each method according to the predicted p - value . 
 these ranks are then aggregated according to the borda rule ( a single - winner election method ) . 
 4 depicts the aggregated ranks obtained by the gene sets that ranked in the first 5 positions in at least one directionality class . 
 directionality classes are represented as columns while numbers and colors represent the position of each gene set ( row ) in the aggregated rank of that column for both contrast nf / n ( left block ) and contrast tf / t ( right block ) . in general , a pathway can be considered significantly regulated in a particular directionality class if it ranks in the first positions ( albeit a general cut - off does not exist ) . 
 as expected , pathways ranking high ( i.e. , small numbers ) in a directionality class ( see , for example , 
 ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes  ) are ranked low ( large numbers ) in the opposite directionality class . 
 such a representation provides a clear and concise comparison of the regulation of pathways in the two contrasts , highlighting common regulation of pathways in normal and transformed cells , like  ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes 
 , down - regulated in both nf / n and tf / t , and specific pathway regulations , different for the two cell lines , like the up - regulation of pathway  steroid biosynthesis  detected in tf / t but not in nf / n . 
 the microarray data and the  piano  computational approach here presented , have allowed to the identification of significant pro - survival processes , otherwise hidden , regulated by pka in glucose deprivation . a part from our approach , these data could be further used to uncover other mechanisms of cancer resistance mediated by pka , whose role in cancer progression has assumed great relevance in recent years , , .

 this activation protects specifically some cancer cells from death induced by glucose starvation . 
 cell effects upon fsk treatment prompted us to investigate in detail the physiological role of pka in the activation of pro - survival mechanisms in glucose starvation . in this regard 
 we performed a microarray analysis of normal nih3t3 and transformed nih3t3-k - ras mouse fibroblasts cultured at 1  mm glucose and daily treated or not with 10  m fsk until 72  h of growth , when the samples were collected . 
 the microarray is deposited into gene expression omnibus under series gse68266 . 
 the microarray data revealed that the activation of pka regulates the expression of genes involved in metabolic , stress - response and pro - survival processes , like glutamine metabolism , autophagy and unfolded protein response , preventing cancer cell death in glucose starvation . 
 altogether these findings suggest that pka activation , by inducing a complex transcriptional program , leads to cancer survival in nutrient stress , a typical feature of developing tumor 
 . these transcriptional data , identifying this important role of pka , will be useful to identify novel target in cancer therapy ."
"peri - implantitis is inflammation of the peri - implant supporting tissue , which can lead to progressive loss of supporting bone , if untreated . 
 a history of periodontitis , poor oral hygiene , and smoking are considered risk factors for peri - implant diseases . 
 it is of paramount importance to treat periodontitis of the residual dentition prior to implant placement . a higher implant failure rate and elevated number of sites with peri - implant bone loss were documented in periodontally compromised patients who did not adhere to comprehensive supportive periodontal therapy . customized and correctly performed 
 supportive periodontal therapy is essential to enhance the long - term outcome of implant therapy . 
 the outcome of non - surgical periodontal treatment ( nspt ) of peri - implantitis is unpredictable . 
 although minor beneficial effects of laser therapy on peri - implantitis have been shown , this method requires further evaluation . 
 the diode laser is not an ablative instrument and can directly contact the implant surfaces without inducing melting , cracking , or crater formation . 
 the 810-nm diode laser , when used in accordance with appropriate parameters , does not damage titanium surfaces , which is useful when uncovering submerged implants , and can be used to treat bacterial induced peri - implantitis . 
 the use of laser treatment in periodontal therapy is an emerging therapeutic option , although little reliable evidence suggests that it can effectively treat peri - implantitis . 
 a 45-year - old male presented with pain and swelling at a mandibular implant site ( nobel biocare , sw ) . clinical examination revealed a deep pocket [ 7-mm pocket depth ( pd ) ] and bleeding on probing [ figure 1 ] , with suppuration and gingival inflammatory edema at the implant site . 
 the patient was in good general health , did not take any medications , and was an occasional smoker ( 4 - 5 cigarettes / day ) . 
 clinical examination revealed 7-mm probing depths , circumferentially around a mandibular implant , bleeding on probing , and the presence of exudate and gingival inflammatory edema no occlusal trauma or parafunctional habits were detected . 
 a periapical radiograph demonstrated bone loss of five fixture threads on the most distal mandibular left implant , when compared to the original radiograph [ figure 2 ] . 
 periapical radiography shows bone loss for five fixture threads on the most distal mandibular left implant the patient was eventually scheduled for periodontal surgery to treat the inflammatory lesion , but emergency intervention was indicated to disinfect the area by removing the bacterial biofilm and alleviating pain using an 810-nm diode laser [ figure 3 ] . 
 the patient was treated using an 810-nm diode laser to disinfect the area and facilitate bacterial biofilm removal by mechanical and manual periodontal instrumentation the patient was asked to rinse with undiluted chlorhexidine 0.2% for 1 min . 
 after insertion of the optical fiber parallel to the long axis of the implant 1 mm from the most apical portion of the pocket , the diode insert was moved in an apico - coronal and mesio - distal direction for 30 sec at each inflamed implant site . 
 it was used at a power of 0.5 w in a continuous wave ( cw ) [ equivalent to 1 w in pulsating mode ( pw ) for 30 s ] in duplicate on each site , for a total time of 360 sec with a fluence of 1.96 j / cm . 
 non - surgical periodontal instrumentation was performed with hand instrumentation using a titan curette ( roncati implant care , by martin kls ) and a piezoelectric ultrasonic device with plastic fused to a metal insert ( piezon master 700 , ems , pi insert ) , as needed . 
 finally , a 0.5% chlorhexidine gel was deposited into the sulcus with a disposable syringe and a blunt needle . 
 the area was checked for plaque removal and home care compliance for the first month on a weekly basis and was followed by routine supportive periodontal therapy at 3-month intervals . 
 the adjunctive use of the diode laser was included in the conventional periodontal maintenance every 6 months for the following 3 years . 
 periodontal indices were documented and intraoral periapical radiographs were taken at the 1-year [ figure 4 ] , and 2- , 3- , 4- , and 5-year [ figures 5 and 6 ] follow - up recall appointments . 
 periapical radiograph : 1-year post - non - surgical treatment periapical radiograph : 5-year follow - up clinical probing depth : 5-year follow - up satisfactory results were obtained by the application of laser - assisted non - surgical peri - implant therapy . 
 periodontal pocket depth was reduced from 7 to 3 mm with no bleeding upon probing . 
 intraoral periapical radiographs , taken for up to 5 years post - non - surgical treatment , provide evidence of some improvement of the bone level . 
 the reduction of periodontal pockets is probably due to re - epithelialization , with formation of a long junctional epithelial attachment . 
 at the 6 european workshop on periodontology , it was reported that mechanical non - surgical therapy with an adjunct of local antibiotics or laser application was effective longitudinally to reduce bleeding on probing and pds over a period of 6 - 12 months . 
 however , the outcome is unpredictable due to possible re - infection related to the inability to completely remove bacterial deposits from titanium implant surfaces , thus interfering with new histological bone - to - implant contact . 
 the primary objective of non - surgical treatment for peri - implantitis is to remove bacterial contaminants to allow resolution of the inflammatory lesion . to date , no critical probing depths in the therapy of peri - implant diseases have been defined to guide selection of a non - surgical or surgical approach . 
 laser treatment may serve as an alternative or adjunctive treatment to conventional periodontal mechanical therapy or peri - implantitis . 
 diode lasers have a bactericidal effect due to a localized increase in temperature , which has been verified in vivo using dna probes that detect periodontal pathogens . 
 threaded implants have a different morphology than root surfaces ; therefore , debridement instruments might be different . 
 the laser may be a valuable tool to detoxify the implant surface [ figure 7 ] , and significant bacterial reduction should lead to a more satisfactory recovery . 
 it is possible to point the diode laser insert toward the wall of the ulcerated pocket epithelium to kill virulent periodontal pathogens . 
 vaporization of granulomatous tissue seems to result in a more favorable effect compared to that of solo instrumentation . 
 threaded implants have a different morphology than root surfaces ; therefore , debridement instruments may differ . 
 the laser may facilitate detoxification of the implant surface the diode laser detoxifies root and implant surfaces by inactivating bacterial endotoxins . 
 the thermal effect weakens calculus chemical adhesion to the root and/or implant , facilitating its removal by curette or ultrasonic devices . 
 the diode laser also stimulates fibroblasts and osteoblasts , which , in turn , cause increased production of rna messengers , leading to significant collagen production during periodontal tissue healing . 
 the patient experienced no postoperative discomfort and he was able to comply with home care procedures , such as debridement , after the surgery . 
 in contrast , patients often have post - treatment discomfort , and compliance with home care procedures decreases because the recommended home care protocols for plaque control are painful ; this results in impaired healing . 
 important changes were also detected in the patient : bleeding , a marker of inflammation with a high prognostic value , was compared at baseline and at 1 year after laser - assisted periodontal therapy , and was reduced significantly to < 20% . 
 absence of bleeding has a negative predictive value . besides laser therapy , the following therapeutic interventions 
 all of these combined may have contributed to healing , complicating isolation of the most effective modality . 
 the laser has been used as an adjunct to many periodontal treatments , but it is not a replacement for conventional non - surgical treatment or proper home care with adequate patient compliance . the absence of attached gingiva may be an etiological factor in the development of peri - implantitis ; this issue is controversial . 
 traditional protocols of non - surgical periodontal therapy , in conjunction with the use of an 810-nm diode laser , can be an effective alternative treatment modality for peri - implantitis 
 . other treatment options may successfully enhance resolution of peri - implant soft and hard tissue inflammation , and preserve long - term periodontal health . 
 regardless of the method used , correctly performed supportive periodontal therapy is a key factor in successful implant therapy .","outcome non surgical periodontal treatment nspt peri implantitis unpredictable

"prescription drugs are becoming the drugs of choice for adolescents and young adults with a reported increase in misuse of 212% from 1992 to 2003 . the substance abuse and mental health services administration   and johnston et al . 
 have reported that the misuse or nonmedical use of prescription drugs has a greater prevalence rate than illicit drugs use with the exception of marijuana use , with the highest prevalence rates being reported among adolescents and young adults . 
 the increased incidence and prevalence of nonprescription and prescription drug misuse among young people led to the office of national drug control policy 's   prescription drug abuse prevention campaign to target parents of adolescents in 2008 . 
 friedman   and manchikanti   argued that continued prescription drug misuse among adolescents may be attributed to adolescents ' perception that this type of drug use is safer than illicit drugs , the ease of access to these drugs , and lower societal stigma about misuse compared to illicit drugs use . 
 these three variables are directly related to peer influence and are consistent with kandel 's   adolescent socialization theory , particularly imitation and social reinforcement . 
 kandel   described peer influence , rather than parent influence , as being the most important influence to adolescents ' immediate lifestyle , hence peers being more relevant in understanding adolescents ' health risk behaviors . 
 regarding kandel 's   theory , imitation involves adolescents modeling their behaviors and attitudes based on others ' behaviors and social reinforcement involves adolescents internalizing and displaying behaviors and attitudes approved by others . 
 both are applicable to adolescents ' perception of prescription drug use being safer than illicit drugs and lower stigma about misuse , since these perceptions are based on attitudes displayed by others in conjunction with adolescents ' own beliefs . 
 the theory also applies to ease of access to drugs , such that if parents and peers are engaging in prescription drug use , drugs may be more easily accessible to adolescents . also noteworthy is the developmental level of adolescents / young adults , and according to e. h. erikson and j. m. erikson   peers are key counterplayers during this stage of life . 
 adolescents / young adults are forming their identity which may be based on in - group or out - group values . 
 if adolescents'/young adults ' group values involve prescription drug use , then there will be norms for use and ease of access to drugs . 
 understanding the roles of adolescents ' perception that this type of drug use is safer than illicit drugs , the ease of access to these drugs , and lower societal stigma about misuse compared to illicit drugs use may provide additional targetable areas for intervention . 
 hence , the purpose of this study is to explore the extent to which these variables are predictive of adolescents'/young adults ' prescription drug misuse .   in the health risk behaviors and substance abuse literature , 
 abuse has been shown to be related to perceived risk ( pr ) such that as pr of substance use increases , use decreases [ 912 ] . 
 pr of nonprescription and prescription drugs have not been extensively explored with most studies addressing pr of nonprescription and prescription drug misuse in relation to illicit drugs . 
 arria et al .   conducted a longitudinal study on perceived harmfulness of stimulants and analgesics in college students and found that 25.2% and 27.8% of students attributed a descriptor of  great risk  to the occasional nonmedical use of stimulant and analgesics misuse , respectively . 
 additionally , prescription stimulants and analgesics were viewed as less risky than cocaine but more risky than marijuana and binge drinking . 
 the partnership for a drug free america   ( pdfa ) reported that 40% of adolescents viewed prescription medication to be safer than illegal drugs . 
 additionally , adolescents did not believe that prescription pain relievers were addictive and believed that it was okay to use prescription drugs without a prescription once in a while . 
 prescription drugs may be perceived as being safer than illicit drugs because they can be legitimately prescribed by doctors and are food and drug administration approved [ 5 , 6 ] . 
 manchikanti   also reported that the increase in social acceptability of medicating ailments may also be responsible for misperceptions of prescription drug misuse safety . 
 based on these findings , we hypothesize that pr of prescription drugs will be significantly lower than illicit drugs and that the belief that prescription drugs misuse is safer than illicit drug use will be positively related to nonprescription and prescription drug misuse . 
 another variable mentioned by friedman   as being responsible for the increased prevalence in prescription drug misuse is lower societal stigma about misuse . like pr 
 , the role of parent and peer approval has been extensively studied in the substance abuse literature but few studies have focused on its relations with nonprescription and prescription drug misuse . 
 ford   found that adolescents who had parents and peers with pro - substance abuse attitudes were more likely to report engaging in prescription drug misuse . 
 additionally , the pdfa   highlighted that 21% of adolescents reported that their parents wo n't care if they caught them engaging in prescription pain reliever misuse . 
 researchers also found that adolescents whose friends engage in substance use were more likely to engage in prescription drugs misuse [ 1518 ] . according to the pdfa 
 , 33% of adolescents reported that there was less shame attached to using prescription pain relievers than illicit drugs . 
 these findings reiterate imitation and social reinforcement as described in kandel 's   adolescent socialization theory and the influence of in - groups and out - groups . 
 we hypothesize that perceived societal stigma ( pss ) in the form of peer and parent disapproval and perceived peer misuse would be related to nonprescription and prescription drug misuse . 
 we also hypothesize that , similar to pr , participants will perceive peers to be more approving of prescription drug misuse than illicit drug use . 
 ease of access to nonprescription and prescription drugs has been suggested as responsible for the increased prevalence of misuse ; however , similar to pr and pss , few researchers have studied the extent to which this is true . 
 .   found that half the sample they examined reported that prescription stimulants were easily accessible on campus with 21.2% and 9.8% reporting being offered stimulants or purchasing stimulants from other students , respectively . 
 however , they did not explore the extent to which easy accessibility was predictive of misuse . 
 poulin   found that students who reported medical use of stimulants reported giving , selling , and being forced to give their medication to others . giving and selling prescribed medication to others 
 were positively related to increase in nonmedical stimulant use , thus providing evidence for the role of ease of access in stimulant misuse . 
 manchikanti   identified several modes of access to prescription drugs including internet pharmacies , drug theft , sharing among family and friends , doctor shopping , and improper prescribing . 
 the pdfa   also provided evidence for the role of easy access to drugs in the increase in misuse prevalence . according to the pdfa , adolescents reported having easy access to prescription drugs via parents ' medicine cabinets ( 62% ) , others ' prescriptions ( 50% ) , and from the internet ( 32% ) . 
 this provides further evidence for the role of imitation and social reinforcement in prescription drug misuse . 
 therefore , we hypothesize that ease of access to nonprescription and prescription drugs will be predictive of nonprescription and prescription drug misuse . based on kandel 's   adolescent socialization theory and the proposals by friedman   and manchikanti   about the role of pr , pss , and ease of access in the increased prevalence of nonprescription and prescription drug misuse , we hypothesize that these variables will be predictive of misuse . 
 specifically , pr and pss will be negatively related to misuse and ease of access will be positively related to misuse . 
 the sample consisted of 465 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 years ( m = 18.57 , sd = 0.86 ) . 
 participants were predominantly caucasian ( 74% ) , female ( 60% ) , and freshmen ( 73% ) 
 . sixteen percent of participants ( n = 73 ) reported some prescription drug misuse and 15% ( n = 71 ) reported some nonprescription drug misuse . note that cough and cold syrup and pills misuse ( 9% , n = 42 ) were not included in the frequency calculations because the question about cough and cold syrup and pills did not distinguish between prescription and nonprescription drugs . 
 twenty - six percent of participants ( n = 119 ) reported some nonprescription and/or prescription drug misuse . 
 misuses of nonprescription and prescription drugs were defined as use of medications to get high . 
 pr was measured by perceived personal risk , which is the extent to which the participant felt they would be at risk of getting sick or hurt if they engaged in nonprescription , prescription , and illicit drug use . 
 pr was measured on a 7-point evaluation scale ranging from no risk at all ( 1 ) to very much at risk ( 7 ) . 
 pss was participants ' self - report on their perceptions about how friends and parents felt about them engaging in nonprescription , prescription , and illicit drug use ( i.e. , parent and peer disapproval ) . 
 parent and peer approval was measured on a 5-point likert scale ranging from strongly approve ( 1 ) to strongly disapprove ( 5 ) . 
 pss variables also included participants ' perceptions of friends ' nonprescription and prescription drug misuse . 
 friends misuse was participants ' assessment of the percentage of friends who engaged in misuse in 10% increments ( e.g. , 0% , 1%10% , 11%20% ) . to measure accessibility of nonprescription and prescription drugs , participants answered questions on whether their friends brought medications to school for recreational use ( access in school ) and what nonprescription and prescription drugs were kept in the home . 
 participants were also asked about their perceptions about the safety of nonprescription and prescription drug misuse in relation to illicit drugs use . 
 nonprescription and prescription drugs misuse and illicit drug use were measures of lifetime use on a 5-point frequency scale ranging from never ( 1 ) to more than 40 times ( 5 ) . for nonprescription and prescription drugs , 
 the question stem was  have you ever used the following medications recreationally ?  and for illicit drugs the question stem was  have you ever engaged in the following activity ?  prescription drug misuse was measured for the following classifications of medications ; prescription pain ( e.g. , vicodin , codeine , oxycontin , percocet ) , prescription stimulants ( adderall , dexedrine , ritalin ) , and prescription sedatives and tranquilizers ( mebaral , quaaludes , xanax , valium ( benzodiazepines ) , nembutal , fluoxetine ) . nonprescription drug misuse was measured for nonprescription pain relievers ( e.g. , tylenol , motrin , advil , aleve , ibuprofen , aspirin ) and nonprescription sleeping pills . 
 misuse was also measured for cough and cold syrup and pills ; however , no distinction was made between prescription and nonprescription . 
 data were collected as part of the  media influences on health risk behaviors and prescription drug use in young adults  project . 
 data were collected using a survey developed by the authors specifically for this project ; however , portions of the survey ( e.g. , pr and pss ) were modified from omori and ingersoll . 
 college students were recruited from the introduction to psychology course to participate in the study . 
 participants completed an online survey at a computer lab where workstations were separated by desk partitions . 
 participants received two research credits upon completion of the survey . to ensure participant privacy , 
 descriptive statistics were computed ( see table 1 ) . to test for differences in pr and perception of societal stigma for nonprescription and prescription drug misuse versus illicit drug use , paired sample t - tests were computed . 
 pearson correlations were computed to explore the relationship between participants pr and pss for nonprescription and prescription drug misuse and that of illicit drug use . 
 nonprescription and prescription drug misuse was dichotomized into nonusers ( participants who responded never to the questions ) and users ( participants who reported any misuse ) . 
 binary logistic regressions were calculated to differentiate pr , pss , and access to nonprescription and prescription drugs on self - reported nonusers and misusers . 
 demographic variables including age , gender , and ethnicity were controlled for in the first step of the regression analyses . 
 results of correlations and paired sample t - tests are presented in table 2 . 
 pr of nonprescription and prescription drugs misuse was positively correlated with pr of marijuana and crack or cocaine at the p  0.001 . 
 similarly , peer approval for nonprescription and prescription drug misuse was positively correlated with peer approval for marijuana and crack or cocaine use at the p  0.001 . 
 parent approval for prescription pain , prescription sedatives and tranquilizers , prescription stimulants , and nonprescription sleeping pills was positively correlated with marijuana and crack or cocaine use at the p < 0.05 to p  0.001 range . 
 parent approval for nonprescription pain was significantly positively correlated with approval for marijuana use and uncorrelated with approval for crack or cocaine use . 
 parent approval for cough / cold syrup was uncorrelated with approval for marijuana use and crack or cocaine use . 
 pr of all nonprescription and prescription drugs examined were lower than the pr of crack or cocaine confirming the hypothesis that pr of prescription drugs is lower than that of illicit drugs . 
 participants also perceived risk from marijuana use to be higher than that from nonprescription pain , cough / cold syrup , and nonprescription sleeping pills misuse . 
 participants perceived risk from the misuse of prescription pain and prescription sedatives and tranquilizers to be higher than that of marijuana use . regarding pss , participants reported parent disapproval of all nonprescription and prescription drugs misuse as significantly lower than parent disapproval of marijuana and crack or cocaine use . 
 participants reported that their peer disapproval of nonprescription and prescription drugs misuse was significantly lower than that of crack or cocaine . 
 these results confirm that participants perceived peers and parents to be more approving of nonprescription and prescription drug misuse . 
 participants ' pss of all the nonprescription and prescription drugs measured with the exception of cough / cold syrups and pills and nonprescription pain medication was higher than that of marijuana use . 
 participants ' perceived peers to be less disapproving of nonprescription pain misuse than marijuana use . 
 results of binary logistic regression analyses predicting nonprescription and prescription drug misuse are presented in table 3 . 
 regarding prescription pain drugs misuse , caucasians were more likely to be misusers than african - americans / black and hispanics , while pr and peer disapproval were negatively associated with use . 
 access to prescription medications at home was positively associated with misuse . for prescription sedatives and tranquilizers , african - americans / blacks were less likely to be misuses than caucasians , and parent disapproval and peer use were positively associated with misuse . 
 age was positively related to misuse of stimulants while peer disapproval and perceived risk were negatively related to misuse . 
 no other predictor variables were related to nonprescription sleep drugs misuse . for cough / cold syrup and pills , peer disapproval and 
 note that the odds ratio and confidence intervals could not be calculated for asians for any of the prescription drugs , for hispanics for nonprescription sleep , and for ethnicity and access in home for cold / cough syrup and pills due to extremely large standard errors . 
 as discussed in friedman   and manchikanti , we proposed that pr , perception of illicit drugs being safer than street drugs , pss , and access to nonprescription and prescription drug misuse would be significantly related to misuse . 
 our results provide some evidence that these variables provide a plausible explanation for increased prescription drug misuse among adolescents / young adults . both pr and pss of nonprescription and prescription drugs misuse and illicit drug use were positively correlated , suggesting that adolescents / young adults recognize that nonprescription and prescription drugs misuse are risky . 
 these findings also provide evidence for the high correlation of illicit drug use and nonprescription and prescription medication misuse [ 16 , 18 , 22 ] . 
 specifically , pr for one substance may influence pr for the other substance and subsequent decisions to engage in use of both substances . 
 additionally , adolescents / young adults may belong to in - groups and out - groups that are consistent in how they perceive substance abuse , for example , a group that disapproves of illicit drug use may also disapprove of prescription drug misuse . 
 these results also provide evidence for social reinforcement and imitation of attitudes proposed in the adolescent socialization theory . 
 pr and pss of nonprescription and prescription drugs being lower than crack or cocaine but not marijuana highlight an important trend that is somewhat consistent with arria et al .   and 
 specifically , the potential of a substitution effect whereby adolescents / young adults perceive misuse of nonprescription and prescription drugs as a middle ground between too little and too much risk , as well as the formation of a new sub - culture should be explored . 
 these findings also suggest a need to reevaluate and reconfigure programs targeting marijuana prevention with programs emphasizing pr and stigma ( possibly via harsher penalties for use ) . 
 in addition to reevaluating marijuana programs , more should also be done to increase awareness of the risks associated with nonprescription and prescription drug misuse . 
 the office of national drug control policy 's   media campaign targeted parents ; however , the findings of this study suggest that adolescents / young adults may benefit from additional campaigns targeting them ( adolescents / young adults ) and their peers that highlight the risks associated with nonprescription and prescription drug misuse . 
 addressing misuse in this way may be very effective since it will reduce the amount of unhealthy or inappropriate social reinforcement and imitation of undesirable attitudes regarding prescription drug misuse currently displayed by adolescents / young adults . 
 the inconsistency in pr and pss of nonprescription and prescription drugs when compared to marijuana may also explain why pain medication misuse is second only to marijuana use . 
 the only drugs perceived as being less risky than marijuana were nonprescription pain , nonprescription sleep , and cough and cold medications suggesting that adolescents'/young adults ' perception of nonprescription and prescription drugs differ probably due to access or level of control imposed by the food and drug administration . also noteworthy 
 is the nonsignificant relationship between parent disapproval for cough / cold syrup and pills and marijuana and crack or cocaine . 
 possible explanations for these nonsignificant relationships include parents not viewing these drugs as risky and worthy of discussion with adolescents , parents not recognizing that these drugs are subject to misuse , adolescents mistaking access for approval , or both parents and adolescent not connecting the relationship between misuse of cough / cold medications and illicit drugs . 
 though nonprescription drugs are less risky than prescription drugs , it is imperative that programs and campaigns incorporate the dangers associated with the improper use of nonprescription drugs , particularly among adolescents and young adults , instead of focusing solely on prescription drugs . to predict misuse , 
 demographic variables were first controlled for . given the restricted age range of our sample , it was interesting that there was a significant age difference for prescription stimulant misusers . 
 we propose that since stimulants are known  study drugs  , older participants may be engaging in more stimulant misuse due to demands of classes . 
 surprisingly , particularly for pain medication , gender was not a significant predictor of misuse . 
 several researchers have found that women tend to misuse pain medications more often than men [ 24 , 25 ] . 
 one possible reason for our nonsignificant results is our definition of misuse . in most studies , 
 misuse is broadly defined as non - prescribed use , but because our definition was limited to recreational use we may have screened out the young women who misuse these medications for pain relief rather than getting high . 
 consistent with friedman , manchikanti , and ford , pss was the strongest predictor of all nonprescription and prescription drug misuse with the exception of nonprescription sleeping pills . 
 this reiterates the need for prevention programs to target adolescents / young adults ; adolescents / young adults influence each other 's decision to engage in use therefore increasing the pr and reducing acceptance of nonprescription and prescription drug misuse in some adolescents and young adults may have a ripple effect . 
 of particular note is the significantly positive relationship between parent disapproval , peer use , and sedatives and tranquilizers misuse . 
 these findings highlight that though parents may be important and instrumental in limiting access and exposure to medications , their disapproval may have the reverse effect on adolescents / young adults . 
 it also further explains the role of peer groups and peer norms in misuse and further confirms kandel   findings about the role of peers in immediate lifestyle choices adolescents / young adults make . 
 pr was only a significant predictor of prescription pain , prescription sedatives and tranquilizers , and prescription stimulants , suggesting that other variables may also be contributing to adolescents and young adults ' decision to engage in misuse . 
 pr may still be important but may be interacting with other variables in the decision - making process . 
 future studies should explore other correlates of misuse and how they interact with pr to influence misuse . 
 noteworthy is the failure of the variable , prescription drug not being safer than illicit drug , to predict misuse . 
 this suggests that pr in general may be more important than risk in relation to other substances for predicting misuse . 
 regarding access to medication , medicine kept in the home was only significantly related with misuse of nonprescription sleeping pills . 
 separate regression analyses were conducted including access to medicine cabinets in the home and this was not significantly correlated to misuse for any classification of drug . 
 we hypothesize therefore that medicine kept in the home being a significant predictor of misuse may be due to a combination of access and acceptability of use for medical reasons as suggested by manchikanti   and consistent with social reinforcement and imitation . 
 access in school was only predictive of prescription pain , and the authors suspect that these medications were probably the most accessible medications taken to school . 
 as mentioned before , this study was restricted to recreational users of nonprescription and prescription medication , these misusers do not encompass all non - medical use therefore generalizations about misuse are limited . 
 additionally , the findings of this study should be viewed as exploratory due to the restrictedness and non - representativeness of the sample . 
 because of the higher misuser to nonuser ratio , statistical power to detect significant correlates of misuse may have been insufficient ; therefore , future studies should replicate these analyses with lower misuse to nonuser ratios . 
 other future directions include using the results from this study as a basis for developing a peer - focused prevention intervention and a prescription drug misuse awareness intervention . 
 to conclude , adolescents'/young adults ' pr and pss of nonprescription and prescription drugs misuse differ from their perception of illicit drug use , particularly for crack or cocaine . 
 their perceptions are important because they are correlated with misuse and program planners should work towards targeting these perceptions to prevent and decrease misuse . 
 additionally , access to medications also influences misuse and this suggests that to prevent and decrease use , stronger measures should be taken to restrict access to otc and prescription drugs .","friedman manchikanti argued continued prescription drug misuse among adolescents may attributed adolescents perception type drug use safer illicit drugs ease access drugs lower societal stigma misuse compared illicit drugs use

 adolescents / young adults ( n = 465 ; mage = 18.57 , sd = 0.86 ) completed an online survey about their nonprescription and prescription drug misuse , other substance use , and correlates of use . 
 perceived risk , societal stigma , and access to nonprescription and prescription drugs were predictive of misuse . 
 results support program planners working towards targeting perceived risk and societal stigma in reducing misuse and the need to restrict and monitor access to nonprescription and prescription drugs for adolescents / young adults ."
"among menstrual disorders , menorrhagia , dysmenorrhea , and abnormal cycles are highly prevalent and are considered as disabling conditions among women at reproductive ages . 
 dysmenorrhea is defined as painful cramps in lower abdomen during menstruation without any evidence of pelvic pathologic lesions . 
 this condition occurs right before or during menstruation without any describable macroscopic pelvic pathology . in general , 
 50% of women suffer from dysmenorrhea and 10% experience this condition for 13 days a month . 
 one study reported the prevalence of dysmenorrhea to be over 75% . in another study in sweden , more than 72% of 19-year - old women suffered from this condition ( 34% , 23% , and 15% of the participants had mild , moderate , and severe symptoms , respectively ) . 
 dysmenorrhea can reduce efficiency and production due to daily stresses and socioeconomic losses . in the us , 
 at least 600 million hours and 2 billion dollars are lost due to dysmenorrhea every year . 
 in addition , dysmenorrhea affects young girls ' opinion about femininity and method of childbirth . for the treatment and control of dysmenorrhea 
 , there are many ways : common drug interventions for reduction of pain include nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( nsaids ) and oral contraceptive pills . despite their usefulness , 
 their side effects include diarrhea , stomachache , nausea , renal complications , hepatic complications , blood problems , edema , sleepiness , indigestion , and fatigue . 
 other treatment methods also include supplementary vegetarian diet , vitamins , minerals , nerve block , spinal manipulation , magneto - inertial fusion , percutaneous electrical nerve stimulation , acupressure , acupuncture , rest , muscle relaxation , reflexology , hand pressure , heat , aromatherapy , and physical therapy . 
 since the acupressure is a new therapy , the side effects of drug therapies are not readily acceptable . hence , but the rationales for using complementary and alternative medicine have been widely used for many years , and they are accepted by many people and doctors . 
 approximately 38.2 million adult people in america have used complementary medicine ( herbs and supplements ) in 2002 . moreover , more than half of them said that complementary medicine was important to their health and well - being , besides the points examined in this study . in reviewing the past 30 years , no article has been found . 
 hence , the acupressure points in this research are entirely new . according to the gate control theory of pain , cutaneous stimulation through massaging , needling , and 
 scratching can stimulate large fiber nerves that transfer nervous impulses to the spinal cord . in case 
 this stimulation is continued , it can close pain gates , eventually reducing the feeling of pain . 
 evidence has shown acupressure as a noninvasive , inexpensive , safe , and simple method for reduction of labor pain . in the study by wang et al . , ( 2010 ) 
 acupressure was applied at sanyinjiao ( sp-6 ) acupoint for 20 min to assess its effect on menstrual pain and distress in young women suffering from dysmenorrhea . 
 the results revealed a significant decrease in pain in acupressure and self - care training groups based on short - form mcgill pain questionnaire . in another study in iran , 
 acupressure at sp-6 acupoint significantly reduced the intensity of dysmenorrhea in the intervention group compared to the control group 30 min and 1 , 2 , and 3 h after the intervention ( p < 0.05 ) . in the present study , 
 our aim is to perform acupressure at guan yuan ( rn-4 ) and qu gu ( rn-2 ) acupoints located on the abdominal meridian between the navel and the symphysis pubis and compare its effect to that of using ibuprofen ( control group ) . 
 rn-2 acupoint is also located on the midline , 5 cuns below the navel , 1 cun between the two grooves of the interphalangeal joints of the massager s middle finger . 
 the rationale for using self - care education to increase awareness of one s own body and the adoption of appropriate health behavior and lifestyle modification such as diet and exercise will lead to the improvement of dysmenorrheal . considering the limited interventions in this 
 regard and importance of complementary medicine , the present study aims to compare self - care behaviors training , acupressure at rn-4 and rn-2 acupoints , and ibuprofen consumption . 
 the present randomized clinical trial was conducted on 120 nonmedical students ( three groups of 40 ) living in dormitories of shiraz university shiraz , iran . 
 the sample size was determined based on the study by kashefi et al . and considering the loss rate of 10% . 
 of course , the initial sample comprised 157 patients with primary dysmenorrhea , of which 37 patients were excluded from the trial due to lack of inclusion criteria [ figure 1 ] . 
 consort diagram of sampling at first , five dormitories of shiraz university were selected randomly . 
 then , one , two , and two dormitories were randomly considered as control , self - care behaviors training , and acupressure groups , respectively . 
 the inclusion criteria of the study were being single , being below 25 years old , having primary dysmenorrhea with pain intensity of four and above based on visual analog scale ( vas ) , having regular menstrual cycles ( 2135 days ) , having experienced dysmenorrhea in the recent six menstrual cycles ( self - report ) , not having used oral contraceptive pills , and treatment interventions ( nsaids , antiprogestins , and supplements ) since 2 months before the study , not suffering from physical ( vertebral fracture , herniated disk , acute inflammation , deep vein thrombosis , and gynecological diseases ) and mental disorders , not consuming special medications such as benzodiazepines and antidepressants , and not having experienced stress due to parents ' divorce or loss of first - degree relatives during the recent 6 months . on the other hand , the exclusion criteria of the study were having symptoms such as burn , itch , and abnormal vaginal discharges , experiencing stressors ( parents ' divorce , loss of first - degree relatives , etc . ) during the study , and not being willing to participate in the study . 
 all interventions and inclusion criteria carried out by the researcher , and research was done in student dormitories . before the intervention , intensity of pain was determined in all the three groups . 
 it should also be noted that researcher s performance of acupressure was confirmed by a specialist . in doing so 
 , pressure was repeatedly applied with the thumb and was controlled by a scale to equalize its amount in each application . 
 first group , in the acupressure group , pressure was applied on the abdominal meridian using the thumb for 20 min ( 15 s pressure , 15 s rest ) over the 1 2 days of menstruation for two cycles . 
 pain intensity was assessed  h , 1 h , and 2 h after application of pressure . 
 it should be mentioned that pain intensity was assessed by the researcher s assistant to avoid bias . 
 the method of compression in acupressure groups was done after obtaining confirmation from a trained researcher ( i.e. , from a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation ) . 
 after confirmation from the researcher , the intervention was conducted . in the second group , 
 self - care behaviors were conducted in two parts : teaching theoretical base of using lecture , discussion , and experience sharing was performed through four sessions ( one - 6090 min session a week ) . the educational content included anatomy and physiology of the genital system , nutrition during the menstrual cycle ( based on books , articles , and a nutritionist s advice , emphasis was put on the resources that were effective in dysmenorrhea ) , the second part was practical training and includes isometric exercises during the menstrual cycle . 
 it should be noted that isometric exercises were educated to researcher by a master of physical education , and researcher was trained to girls in the gymnasium dormitory . 
 isometric exercise duration was 8 weeks , in the first 4 weeks was conducted by the researcher . in the second 4 weeks with an appropriate images of playing sports the girls were given regarding how exercise . 
 and the girls without researcher continued ( a total of 8 weeks ) . to ensure 
 the exercise was done in the dormitory to follow up , as well as phone calls , for continued exercise classes were encouraged after the 1 4 weeks . 
 food recommendations and other educational content have been on the books and articles . in group 
 three , the control group received the routine treatment for dysmenorrhea , i.e. , taking ibuprofen 400 mg three times a day for three cycles . 
 of course , they were provided with the educational pamphlet at the end of the study . 
 questionnaires were completed in the student dormitories and after the intervention ; to avoid sampling bias in research , pain assessment was conducted by a research assistant . in this study , 
 intensity of pain was assessed using mcgill pain questionnaire developed by melzack , which has been introduced as a reliable instrument for the assessment of pain intensity . however , since this questionnaire takes a long time to be completed , its short form was designed and has been frequently used in persian studies . 
 the short form of mcgill pain questionnaire consists of 15 sensory ( 11 questions ) and emotional ( 4 questions ) items , and the patients determine the quality of their pain by selecting one of the options of none , mild , average , and severe . 
 the validity and reliability of this scale in the current research were based on the study performed by adelmanesh et al . 
 that reported cronbach s alpha coefficients of 0.951 , 0.832 , and 0.840 for sensory , emotional , and total scores , respectively . 
 wallis test was used to compare the three study groups . besides , paired t - test was employed to compare the means before and after the intervention . finally , qualitative variables were compared using chi - square test . 
 besides , written informed consents for taking part in the study were obtained from all the participants . hence , thesis number : 92 - 6900 , irct : 2013071013940n1 and ethic number : 1392 - 12 - 11 - 6900 .

 the mean age of the participants was 20.02  1.44 , 20.12  1.50 , and 20.37  1.54 years in the acupressure , training , and control groups , respectively ( p = 0.569 ) . besides , the mean time of beginning of pain after menarche was 1.80  0.82 years in the acupressure group , 1.90  0.77 years in the training group , and 1.87  0.79 years in the control group ( p = 0.844 ) . according to the results of kruskal 
 wallis test , the three groups were homogeneous regarding these two variables [ table 1 ] . 
 comparison of the age of in three groups ( acupressure - education of self - care behaviors and control ) in the training group , the mean intensity of pain was 16.90  7.43 before the intervention and 10.56  5.71 after the intervention , and the results of paired t - test showed that the difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.001 ) . in the acupressure group also , the mean intensity of pain was 20.25  6.93 before the intervention , and the results showed a significant difference in this regard before and 1 and 2 months after the intervention ( p < 0.001 ) [ table 2 ] . 
 comparison of the intensity of pain after and before the acupressure and educational groups based on the mcgill questionnaire in the control group , the mean intensity of pain was 31.77  6.36 before the intervention , 23.52  5.55 1 month after the intervention ( p < 0.001 ) , 9  5.99 2 months after the intervention ( p < 0.001 ) , and 14.57  6.40 3 months after that ( p 
 comparison of the intensity of pain after and before the acupressure and educational and control groups based on the mcgill questionnaire based on mcgill pain questionnaire , the mean intensity of pain was 10.65  5.71 in the training group , 19  5.41 in the control group , and 14.40  6.87 in the acupressure group after the intervention . 
 wallis test , showed that these differences were statistically significant , and both interventions were more effective compared to the control group [ table 4 ] . 
 comparison of the difference mean scores severity of pain of in three groups ( acupressure - education of self - care behaviors and control of the mcgill questionnaire 
 according to the present study results , discussion is on three main axes : in our study , the mean intensity of pain significantly decreased in the self - care training group . chang and chuang conducted a study to introduce the effective factors in dysmenorrhea . in that study , the participants with moderate dysmenorrhea received self - care behaviors training , and the results showed that training self - care behaviors at schools were one of the effective methods in reduction of dysmenorrhea . 
 chen et al . also carried out a research on self - care behaviors using herbal medicines and complementary medicine in primary dysmenorrhea among taiwanese adolescents . 
 the results of the study by chen et al . revealed the necessity to educate individuals regarding the effect of food diet and effective herbal medications on the treatment of dysmenorrhea . in that study , the participants mentioned the reduction of physical activities as a self - care behavior , but the researchers modified this opinion and trained individuals regarding aerobic exercises as a self - care behavior to decrease their pain . 
 , who investigated the effect of heavy exercises on the treatment of dysmenorrhea using mcgill pain questionnaire . 
 the results of that study demonstrated that exercising was effective in reduction of pain without any side effects . 
 in contrast , shafaie - sehati et al . found no significant difference between athletic and nonathletic groups with respect to the frequency of dysmenorrhea . in the present study , 
 self - care behaviors training resulted in a reduction of pain and exercising was among the bases of this training . 
 exercising enters the body in the state of hypoxia where beta - endorphin levels increase . 
 therefore , hypoxia and acidosis stimulate production of beta - endorphins , and the relationship between breathing and beta - endorphin production can be associated with the effect of acidosis on the two through different mechanisms . 
 reduction of pain after self - care training can also be attributed to the control of prostaglandins . 
 in fact , aerobic exercises empty the uterus from waste materials and prostaglandins , which are the main cause of pain , eventually reducing the duration of pain through the menstrual cycle . in another survey exercise after 6 weeks 
 is created flexibility in the hamstring , back and hip muscles , and reduces pain . 
 the current study at the second part findings showed a significant difference in the acupressure group s pain intensity before and after the intervention . 
 considering the limited number of studies conducted on rn-4 and rn-2 acupoints , the results of performance of acupressure at other points have been discussed in this section . in the study by yeh et al . 
 , pressure was applied for 1 min four times a day for 2 days , which is different from our study . 
 the results showed a significant difference in each group s pain intensity before and after the intervention . in the present study , however , the study groups ' pain intensity was significantly different only based on mcgill pain questionnaire . 
 other researches have also revealed the effectiveness of acupressure in treatment of dysmenorrhea and relaxation . in a review study 
 about efficacy of self - acupressure showed several studies ( eight rcts and two quasi - rcts ) have a positive effect and effective on primary dysmenorrhea . in another study concluded that enough evidence not exists for the effectiveness of acupressure or acupuncture and rct larger studies are needed . 
 the analgesic effect of acupressure can be due to release of endorphins and glucocorticoids that block pain gates . 
 acupressure , in fact , refers to the touch technique for balancing human body s energy flow or qi . 
 this method leads to the release of various neurotransmitters , which cut the nervous signals transferred by the nervous system . 
 it also inhibits secretion of prostaglandins , reduces stimulation of cerebral cortex , and regulates secretion of endocrine hormones . 
 based on mcgill pain questionnaire scores , the control group s pain intensity scores were significantly different before and after the intervention . similarly , the results of the studies by zafari and witt et al . indicated the effectiveness of ibuprofen . however , the results obtained by salmalian were on the contrary to those of the present study . 
 in general , nsaids are the first - line treatment , but their side effects , including gastrointestinal problems , make patients choose alternative therapies . 
 overall , the results of the current study showed a significant difference among the three groups regarding the intensity of pain , and that training and acupressure were more effective compared to consumption of ibuprofen . in this study , 
 new and effective acupoints were employed , whereas the previous studies had not used such a combination of effective points . 
 one of the limitations of our study was the difficulty in obtaining the required permissions from dormitories and performing the procedures privately . 
 hence , probable physiological tolerance of pain in each people is different , so feel pain is different , as well as contrast to the reactions and feelings of loss pain after pain relief methods will be different , which is beyond the control of the researcher . 
 another limitation was to assess the severity of pain after intervention . in order to solve the problem and avoid bias in sampling , 
 finally , due to the different time periods , research conducted at the same time for all units is not possible . 
 future studies are recommended to compare the effects of acupressure at other acupoints and common chemical and herbal drugs on primary dysmenorrhea in larger populations . 
 suggestions for future research : ( 1 ) comparison the effect of other point of acupressure on severity of primary dysmenorrhea with the rn-2 , rn-4 points . 
 ( 2 ) the application of educational models such as basnef models on knowledge and attitudes of people with primary dysmenorrhea . 
 according to the current study results , the most effective method in reduction of dysmenorrhea was self - care behaviors training followed by acupressure at rn-4 and rn-2 acupoints and consumption of ibuprofen . 
 considering the side effects of consuming ibuprofen drug , training and acupressure as nonpharmacological , easy , safe , and inexpensive methods can be incorporated into the curricula of girls ' high schools . considering the effectiveness of acupressure in reducing dysmenorrheal , 
 obstetricians , gynecologists , and midwives have recommended acupressure not only in the treatment of dysmenorrhea but also in reducing labor pain and pain control . the effective nondrug method that is the responsibility of the midwifery , and in clinics and delivery room applications and
